foundations	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(nonprofit)	"A foundation (also a charitable foundation) is a category of nonprofit organization or charitable trust that will typically provide funding and support for other charitable organizations through grants, but may engage directly in charitable activities.[1] Foundations include public charitable foundations, such as community foundations, and private foundations which are typically endowed by an individual or family.  The term ""foundation"" though may be used by organizations not involved in public grant making.[2]
 Legal entities existing under the status of ""foundations"" have a wide diversity of structures and purposes. Nevertheless, there are some common structural elements.
 Some of the above must be, in most jurisdictions, expressed in the document of establishment. Others may be provided by the supervising authority at each particular jurisdiction.[citation needed]
 There is no commonly accepted legal definition in Europe for a foundation. There is a proposal for a European Foundation, a legal form that would be recognised throughout Europe, see European Foundation Project.[citation needed]
 The term ""foundation,"" in general, is used to describe a distinct legal entity. Foundations as legal structures (legal entities) and/or legal persons (legal personality), may have a diversity of forms and may follow diverse regulations depending on the jurisdiction where they are created. Foundations are often set up for charitable purposes, family patrimony and collective purposes.
 In some jurisdictions, a foundation may acquire its legal personality when it is entered in a public registry, while in other countries a foundation may acquire legal personality by the mere action of creation through a required document. Unlike a company, foundations have no shareholders, though they may have a board, an assembly and voting members. A foundation may hold assets in its own name for the purposes set out in its constitutive documents, and its administration and operation are carried out in accordance with its statutes or articles of association rather than fiduciary principles. The foundation has a distinct patrimony independent of its founder.
 In Finland, foundations are regulated by the Finnish Patent and Registration Office and have the four following characteristics:[3]
 Foundations are considered legal persons in Finland. The Foundations Act in 2015 dramatically updated the laws regarding foundations.[4]
 There are not many Foundations in comparison to the rest of Europe. In practice public administration requires at least €1 million necessary. States representatives have a mandatory seat in the Board.[5]
 German regulations allow the creation of any foundation for public or private purposes in keeping with the concept of a gemeinwohlkonforme Allzweckstiftung (""general-purpose foundation compatible with the common good""). A foundation should not have commercial activities as its main purpose, but they are permitted if they serve the main purpose of the foundation. There is no minimum starting capital, although in practice at least  is considered necessary.
 A German foundation can either be charitable or serve a private interest. Charitable foundations enjoy tax exemptions. If they engage in commercial activities, only the commercially active part of the entity is taxed. A family foundation serving private interests is taxed like any other legal entity. There is no central register for German foundations.
 Only charitable foundations are subject to supervision by state authorities. Family foundations are not supervised after establishment. All forms of foundations can be dissolved, however, if they pursue anti-constitutional aims. Foundations are supervised by local authorities within each state (Bundesland) because each state has exclusive legislative power over the laws governing foundations.
 In contrast to many other countries, German law allows a tax sheltered charitable foundation to distribute up to one third of its profit to the founder and his next of kin, if they are needy, or to maintain the founder's grave. These benefits are subject to taxation.
 As of 2008[update], there are about 15,000 foundations in Germany, about 85% of them charitable foundations. More than 250 charitable German foundations have existed for more than 500 years; the oldest dates back to 1509. There are also large German corporations owned by foundations, including Bertelsmann, Bosch, Carl Zeiss AG and Lidl. Foundations are the main providers of private scholarships to German students.
 In Italy, a foundation is a private non profit and autonomous organization, its assets must be dedicated to a purpose established by the founder. The founder cannot receive any benefits from the foundation or have reverted the initial assets. The private foundations or civil code foundations are under the section about non commercial entities of the first book (Libro Primo) of the Civil Code of Law (Codice Civile) from 1942. The Art. 16 CC establishes that the statutes of the foundation must contain its name, purpose, assets, domicile, administrative organs and regulations, and how the grants will be distributed. The founder must write a declaration of intention including a purpose and endow assets for such  purpose. This document can be in the form of a notarised deed or a will. To obtain legal personality, the foundation must enroll in the legal register of each Prefettura (local authority) or some cases the regional authority. There are several nuances in requirements according to each foundation's purpose and area of activity.

 A foundation (Fundação) in Portugal is regulated by Law 150/2015,[6] with the exception of religious foundations, which are regulated by the Religious Freedom Law. Foundations may be private, wholly public (created and managed exclusively by public bodies), or public but with private management (created by public entities and optionally also private entities, but whose management is dominated by private entities). Foundations may only be operational after being recognized by the Prime Minister of Portugal.
 Foundations must designate and pursue at least one of twenty-five public benefit goals defined by law. They must also have enough assets to pursue those goals. They may not benefit the founders or any other restricted group, but the general public.
 Portuguese foundations may voluntarily associate themselves via the Portuguese Foundation Centre (CPF – Centro Português de Fundações), that was founded in 1993 by the Eng. António de Almeida Foundation, the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and the Oriente Foundation.[7]
 Foundations in Spain are organizations founded with the purpose of not seeking profit and serving the general needs of the public.  Such foundation may be founded by private individuals or by the public. These foundations have an independent legal personality separate from their founders. Foundations serve the general needs of the public with a patrimony that funds public services and which may not be distributed to the founders' benefit.
 A foundation in Sweden (Stiftelse) is a legal entity without an owner. It is formed by a letter of donation from a founder donating funds or assets to be administered for a specific purpose. When the purpose is for the public benefit, a foundation may enjoy favourable tax treatment. A foundation may have diverse purposes, including but not limited to public benefit, humanitarian or cultural purposes, religious, collective, familiar, or the simple passive administration of funds. Normally, the supervision of a foundation is done by the county government where the foundation has its domicile, however, large foundations must be registered by the County Administrative Board (CAB), which must also supervise the administration of the foundation.
The main legal instruments governing foundations in Sweden are the Foundation Act (1994:1220) and the Regulation for Foundations (1995:1280).
 Under Canadian law, foundations may be public or private, but both are charities.[citation needed]  They collectively comprise a large asset base for philanthropy
 The law does not prescribe any particular form for a foundation in Ireland. Most commonly, foundations are companies limited by guarantee or trusts.  A foundation can obtain a charity registration number from the Revenue Commissioners for obtaining tax relief as far as they can be considered under the law on charity, however, charitable status does not exist in Ireland. The definition usually applied is that from the Pemsel Case of English jurisprudence (1891) and the Irish Income Tax Act 1967.
Trusts have no legal personality and companies acquire their legal status through the Company law and the required documents of incorporation. Foundations are not required to register with any public authority.
 In the UK, the word ""foundation"" is sometimes used in the title of a charity, as in the British Heart Foundation and the Fairtrade Foundation. Despite this, the term is not generally used in English law, and (unlike in civil law systems) the term has no precise meaning. Instead, the concept of Charitable Trust is in use (for example, the Wellcome Trust).
 In the United States, many philanthropic and charitable organizations (such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) are considered to be foundations. However, the Internal Revenue Code distinguishes between private foundations (usually funded by an individual, family, or corporation) and public charities (community foundations or other nonprofit groups that raise money from the general public). While they offer donors more control over their charitable giving, private foundations have more restrictions and fewer tax benefits than public charities.
 The States of Jersey are considering introducing civil law type foundations into its law. A consultation paper presenting a general discussion on foundations was brought forth to the Jersey government concerning this possibility. It was adopted by the states of Jersey on 22 October 2008  – Foundations (Jersey) Law 200-
 At an international level there are a series of networks and associations of foundations, among them Council on Foundations,[8] EFC (European Foundation Centre),[9] WINGS (Worldwide Initiatives for Grantmaker Support).[10][11] Those organization also have a role in supporting research on foundations."
AARP Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AARP#The_AARP_Foundation	"AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons) is a United States-based interest group whose stated mission is ""to empower people to choose how they live as they age"".[3] According to the organization, it had more than 38 million members as of 2018. The magazine and bulletin it sends to its members are the two largest-circulation publications in the United States.
 AARP was founded in 1958 by Ethel Percy Andrus (a retired educator from California) and Leonard Davis (later the founder of the Colonial Penn Group of insurance companies).[4][5] It is an influential lobbying group in the United States focusing largely on issues affecting the elderly.[6][7] AARP sells paid memberships, and markets insurance[8] and other services to its members.
 According to the group's official history, Dr. Ethel Percy Andrus founded AARP in 1958. AARP evolved from the National Retired Teachers Association (NRTA), which Andrus had established in 1947 to promote her philosophy of productive aging, and to promote health insurance for retired teachers. After ten years, she opened the organization to all Americans over 50, creating AARP.[9] Today, the NRTA is a division within AARP.[10]
 Critics of AARP offer an alternative version of the group's origins. 60 Minutes reported in a 1978 exposé that AARP had been established as a marketing device by Leonard Davis, founder of the Colonial Penn Group insurance companies, after he met Ethel Percy Andrus.[11] According to critics, until the 1980s AARP was controlled by Davis, who promoted its image as a non-profit advocate of retirees in order to sell insurance to members.[12] Possibly as a result of this report, AARP conducted a competitive bidding process, and, in 1980, shifted the insurance contracts available to members to Prudential Financial.[13]
 In the 1990s, the United States Senate investigated AARP's non-profit status, with Republican Senator Alan K. Simpson, then chairman of the United States Senate Finance Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy, questioning the organization's tax-exempt status in congressional hearings. According to Charles Blahous, the investigations did not reveal sufficient evidence to change the organization's status,[14] though in an interview years later by The Des Moines Register, Senator Simpson remained ""troubled by AARP's practices"", calling AARP ""the biggest marketing operation in America and money-maker"" and an organization whose practices are ""the greatest abuse of American generosity I witnessed in my time in the U.S. Senate"".[15]
 The organization was originally named the American Association of Retired Persons, but in 1999, it officially changed its name to ""AARP"" (pronounced one letter at a time, ""ay ay ar pee""), to reflect that its focus was no longer American retirees.[16] AARP no longer requires that members be retired, and there are no longer any age restrictions even for a full membership).[17]
 AARP addresses issues affecting older Americans through lobbying efforts at the state and national governmental level, an activity permitted by its 501(c)(4) status. The organization says that it is non-partisan and does not support, oppose or give money to any candidates or political parties. The total revenue for 2006 was approximately $1 billion and it spent $23 million on lobbying.[18] Middle-class security has been a major focus for the organization in recent years.[19] AARP also provides extensive consumer information, volunteer opportunities, and events including an annual National Event & Expo.
 AARP launched Life Reimagined in May 2013, calling it a ""first-of-its-kind series of online and offline experiences that guide people through life transitions by helping them discover new possibilities and connect with a community of people pursuing similar passions and goals"".[20] USA Today called the iniative ""the latest step for the AARP ... as it continues to rebrand itself and become the go-to address for feeling good about aging"".[21]
 AARP has several affiliated organizations, including:
 Because of AARP's sizable membership, it is able to generate its own income without being dependent on government grants or private donors, though it receives help from both of these for specific programs. According to its 2015 Consolidated Financial Statement, the largest sources of income were:
 AARP Services, Inc., founded in 1999, is a wholly owned taxable subsidiary of AARP that manages the range of products and services offered as benefits to members. Its offers include Medicare supplemental insurance; member discounts on rental cars, cruises, vacation packages and lodging; special offers on technology and gifts; pharmacy services; legal services; and long-term care insurance. AARP Services founded AARP Financial Incorporated, a subsidiary that manages AARP-endorsed financial products including AARP Funds. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2010, AARP Financial announced the discontinuation of AARP Funds[25] AARP Services develops new products, manages and markets products and services, and creates and maintains partnership and sponsorship relationships.
 AARP Foundation[26] is AARP's affiliated charity. Foundation programs provide security, protection and empowerment for older persons in need. Low-income older workers receive the job training and placement they need to re-join the workforce. Free tax preparation is provided for low- and moderate-income individuals, with special attention to those 60 and older. The Foundation's litigation staff protects the legal rights of older Americans in critical health, long-term care, consumer and employment situations. Additional programs provide information, education, and services to ensure that people over 50 lead lives of independence, dignity, and purpose. Foundation programs are funded by grants, tax-deductible contributions, and AARP.
 The AARP Foundation's website claims the non-profit ""wants to win back opportunity for those now in crisis, so thousands of vulnerable low-income Americans 50+ can regain their foothold, continue to serve as anchors for their families and communities, and ensure that their best life is still within reach"". Key areas of focus are hunger, income, housing, and isolation. The Foundation's vision is ""a country that is free of poverty where no older person feels vulnerable"".
 One of the goals of the AARP Foundation is its Drive to End Hunger. In 2011, AARP and AARP Foundation formed a relationship with NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon and Hendrick Motorsports to increase awareness of hunger in America with the No. 24 Drive to End Hunger race car and related food drives.[27] Through the Drive to End Hunger program, AARP also sponsored Hendrick driver Kasey Kahne, beginning in 2016.[28]
 In 1979, AARP introduced the nation's first[citation needed] driver safety course geared towards older adults. AARP Driver Safety,[29] which can be completed in a classroom setting or online, teaches defensive driving techniques and provides ""added information on age-related cognitive and physical changes that affect driving"".[30] The course is instructed and promoted by volunteers throughout the U.S.
 In addition to course fees, the program is supported by a grant from the automobile manufacturer, Toyota.[31] Over half million drivers completed the course in 2012 and over 15 million people completed the courses since 1979.[32][33]
 AARP The Magazine, with a circulation of approximately 37 million and the AARP Bulletin with 30 million as of 2016, are the two largest-circulation publications in the United States.[34][35]
 The organization also produces radio and television programs and has a book division.[citation needed]
 AARP en Español is the AARP's Spanish-language multimedia platform. Offerings include a Spanish-language website, a Spanish-language YouTube channel, and informational resources.
 AARP has been active in health care policy debates since the 1960s, and its recent engagement is a reflection of this long-standing involvement.[55]
 AARP's public stances influenced the United States Congress' passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, which created Medicare Part D, in 2003, and also influenced the Congress by resisting radical changes to Social Security in 2005.[56][57] AARP also addressed health care issues in their campaign targeting the 2008 elections with Divided We Fail.
 In a 2003 editorial in the Los Angeles Times, critic Dale Van Atta wrote that AARP was doing unauthorized lobbying for its membership and was lobbying against the best interests of its membership. He said that by lobbying for the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, AARP leaders had betrayed the membership.[58]
 In early 2017, AARP strongly opposed the American Health Care Act of 2017, saying that older Americans would be unfairly burdened with higher premiums and smaller tax credits.[59]
 Approximately seven million people have AARP-branded health insurance, including drug coverage and Medigap, as of April 2007[needs update] [60] and the association earns more income from selling insurance to members than from membership dues.[61] In 2008, AARP began offering new health insurance products: an HMO for Medicare recipients, in partnership with UnitedHealth Group; and a PPO and ""a high-deductible insurance policy that could be used with a health savings account"" to people aged 50–64, in partnership with Aetna.
 While AARP is not an insurer, it allows its name to be used by insurance companies in the sale of products, for which it is paid a commission.[62]
 In a November 2008 editorial, The Des Moines Register and the Canada Free Press called AARP a lobbying group masquerading as a non-profit, meanwhile charging high membership fees and selling expensive private health care plans.[63]
 Senator Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said in 2008 that the ""limited benefit"" insurance plans offered by AARP through UnitedHealth provided inadequate coverage and were marketed deceptively. One plan offered $5,000 for surgery that may cost two or three times that amount.[64]
 AARP markets self-branded Medigap policies. As of October 2009, Medical care reform contained a proposal to trim an associated program Medicare Advantage, which was expected to increase demand for Medigap policies.[65] However, as cited above, AARP also brands a Medicare Advantage plan (MedicareComplete), and would also be subject to cuts under health care reform.[66] According to an Annenberg Public Policy Center report, critics have said AARP had a conflict of interest in supporting the Act, because it ""derives income from the sale of health and life insurance policies"", by licensing its brand to insurance dealers such as New York Life,[67] and would benefit financially from passage of the legislation.[68]
 In 2004, BusinessWeek said questions have arisen in the past about whether AARP's commercial interests may conflict with those of its membership, and characterizes many of the funds and insurance policies that AARP markets as providing considerably less benefit than seniors could get on their own.[69]
 Single-payer advocates have criticized AARP for not supporting the single-payer or public option during the health care debate.[70] Single-payer advocates supported H.R. 676, proposed by Rep. John Conyers (D-MI). AARP released a statement explaining to its members why the organization was not supporting H.R. 676:
 Starting over with a new, ""single-payer"" program will not eliminate the problems Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP currently face, such as the spiraling costs of procedures and prescription medications, as well as technological advances that are often not comprehensively tested to be proven safe or effective before marketing. H.R. 676 does not address the problem of increasing health-care costs. Rather, it allows costs to continue to grow, which will result in unaffordable coverage. John Rother, AARP's former chief lobbyist, said the single-payer model would ""disrupt the system that is currently in place"" and ""require a very significant tax increase"". But Rother admitted that it would be possible to design a system that would avoid these problems. Since AARP's priorities now are to protect the current programs and implement the Affordable Care Act, Rother said that any effort to promote single payer would be undercutting health reform. Rother said: ""To go to a single-payer, you do have to trust government. The climate we're in right now is a very hostile climate for something like that.""[70]
 Rother also thought that an educational effort on the benefits of single payer would undercut the ACA. AARP has not published any material relating to single-payer health insurance on its website, in its several hundred page policy book, or through its Public Policy Institute.[70]
 Approximately 60,000 AARP members quit AARP between July 1 and August 18, 2009, in a controversy that arose over AARP's support for U.S. health care reform. FOX News stated: ""The Atlanta-based American Seniors Association, which is opposed to President Obama's health care plan, is trying to capitalize on growing public dissatisfaction with the AARP."" AARP spokesman Drew Nannis responded that AARP loses about 300,000 members a month on average, and the controversial 60,000 of those that had left had specified leaving over the health care debate. Nannis also stated that the AARP gained 400,000 members and that 1.5 million members renewed their memberships within the same period of time.[71]
The American Seniors Association is a for-profit organization operated by the American Seniors Association Holding Group, Inc (ASAHG, Inc).[72][73]
 Since March 2012, AARP's ""You've Earned a Say"" campaign has sought to foster nonpartisan conversations about how to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. The Richmond (VA) Times-Dispatch reported: ""AARP took the debate about Medicare and Social Security from what it called behind closed doors in Washington to a series of town hall meetings around the country to make sure retirees have a voice in the discussion.""[74]
 In June 2011, AARP dropped its long-standing opposition to cutting Social Security benefits. A news release[75] emphasized that ""AARP has not changed its position on Social Security"". In 2005, AARP led the effort to kill President George W. Bush's plan for partial privatization. AARP now has concluded that change is inevitable, and it wants to be at the table to try to minimize the pain. John Rother, AARP's policy chief and a prime mover for the new position, said: ""The ship was sailing. I wanted to be at the wheel when that happens."" AARP declined to join a coalition of about 300 unions, women's groups, and liberal advocacy organizations created to fight Social Security benefit cuts. Rother said, ""The coalition's role was to kind of anchor the left, and our role is going to be to actually get something done"".[76]
 Criticism has also been leveled at the salaries that AARP staff earn, and the use of first class and business class travel for short trips. According to AARP's 2014 IRS annual return, Chief Executive Officer Addison B. Rand received $1,698,289 of salary and benefits from AARP and its subsidiaries.[77] Board members, officers, and key employees flew first class on flights longer than five hours unless business class was available.[77] The Chief Executive Officer flew first-class on flights longer than 90 minutes.[77] AARP reported that it had spent $8,694,890 on compensation of its officers, directors, and key employees during 2014.[77]
 Charity Navigator rated the AARP Foundation overall at 91.22 out of 100 possible points (a ""four star"" rating), giving it a financial rating of 88.26 out of 100 (""three stars"") and an accountability and transparency rating of 96.00 (""four stars"") for its fiscal year 2017.[78]"
Acorns Children's Hospice	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorns_Children%27s_Hospice	"Acorns Children's Hospice Trust is a registered charity,[1] offering a network of care and support to life-limited and life-threatened children and their families across the West Midlands and part of the South West of England. Acorns has three hospices, situated in Birmingham, Walsall and Worcester as well as a Community Team that offer support to families in their homes. The catchment area for the Hospices comprises the counties of Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire as well as parts of Staffordshire, Shropshire, and the West Midlands.
 Acorns provide a network of specialist palliative nursing care and support for babies, children and young people aged 0–18 who have life-limiting or life-threatening conditions and associated complex needs.
 Acorns relies on the community to fund the majority of its activities.
 In the last year (2018–19) Acorns Children's Hospice supported 787 children and 1,223 families, including those who are bereaved.
 The Trust runs over 50 shops across the ""Heart of England."" Acorns has the largest regional charity retail chain [2] and in 2015-2016 they raised over £1,500,000.[3] Acorns now have two furniture shops in Chelmsley Wood and at Beckett's in Wythall.
 Acorns also have a boutique retail outlet in Station Road, Solihull and in Barnt Green, that deals in high-quality ladies' wear and fashionable accessories.
 Aston Villa F.C. have supported Acorns since 2006 and has already paid for 230 days' worth of hospice care. Several players have visited the children and families who use Acorns. Acorns highlighted the need for further assistance to aid the extra thousand children in the local area who needed the assistance of Acorns. Aston Villa responded by offering a platform to advertise the Hospice to a wider audience. On 7 July 2008, the club unveiled the kit for the 2008–09 season which has the Acorns logo in the position associated with the main kit sponsor. An Acorns spokesperson said ""We are absolutely delighted that our logo will be seen at every home and away match during the 2008–09 season, helping to raise awareness of our work and of the constant need by all children’s hospices to fundraise. This really is the beginning of an amazing partnership, believed to be the first of its kind in the Premier League.""[4] The deal was extended for the 2009–10 season.[5] For the 2010–11 season onwards, Acorns is Aston Villa's Official Charity Partner.[6] When Marc Albrighton scored the 20,000th goal in Premier League history, he chose Acorn's as the charity to receive the £20,000 prize donation.[7]"
Action Against Hunger	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Against_Hunger	"Action Against Hunger (or Action Contre La Faim (ACF) in French) is a global humanitarian organization which originated in France and is committed to ending world hunger. The organization helps malnourished children and provides communities with access to safe water and sustainable solutions to hunger.
 In 2014, Action Against Hunger worked in 49 different countries around the world with more than 6,000 employees and volunteers helping 13.6 million people in need.[1]
 Established in 1979 by a group of French doctors, scientists, and writers. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Alfred Kastler served as the organization's first chairman.
 The group initially provided assistance to Afghan refugees in Pakistan, famine-stricken Ugandan communities, and Cambodian refugees in Thailand. It expanded to address additional humanitarian concerns in Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Balkans and elsewhere during the 1980s and 1990s. Action Against Hunger's Scientific Committee pioneered the therapeutic milk formula (F100), now used by all major humanitarian aid organizations to treat acute malnutrition. As a result, the global mortality rate of severely malnourished children under the age of five has been reduced from 25% to 5%.[2] A few years later, therapeutic milk was repackaged as ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs), a peanut-based paste packaged like a power bar. These bars allow for the treatment of malnutrition at home and do not require any preparation or refrigeration.
 The international network currently has headquarters in five countries – France, Spain, the United States, Canada, and the UK. Its four main areas of work include nutrition, food security, water and sanitation, and advocacy.[3]
 Integrated approaches with various sectors of intervention:
 Action Against Hunger partners with leaders from the food and beverage industry to bring attention to global hunger. Each year, several campaigns are ran by the network to raise funds and support the organisation's programs : Restaurants Against Hunger and Love Food Give Food.[4][5]
 In 2017, Action Against Hunger International Network is present in 51 countries:[6]
 Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroun, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Soudan, Tanzania, Chad, Zimbabwe
 Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines
 Haïti
 South Caucasus, Turkey, Ukraine
 Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Palestinian Occupied Territories, Yemen, Jordan, Iraq
 Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru
 Since 1995 Action Against Hunger developed an international network to have a bigger global impact.
 The Network has 5 headquarters in the world: France, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.
 Action Against Hunger has also a West Africa Regional Office (WARO) located in Dakar, a Training center in Nairobi and 5 logistic platforms (Lyon, Paris, Barcelona, Dubai, Panama).
 This network increases the human and financial capacities and enables a specialization per headquarter."
ActionAid	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionAid	"ActionAid is an international non-governmental organization whose primary aim is to work against poverty and injustice worldwide.[1][unreliable source?]
 ActionAid is a federation of 45 country offices that works with communities, often via local partner organisations, on a range of development issues. It was founded in 1972 by Cecil Jackson-Cole as a child sponsorship charity (originally called Action in Distress) when 88 UK supporters sponsored 88 children in India and Kenya, the primary focus being is providing children with an education, further the human rights for all, assisting people that are in poverty, assisting those who face discrimination,[2] and also assist people who face injustice.[3] ActionAid works with over 15 million people in 45 different countries to assist those people.[3]
 Today its head office is located in South Africa with hubs in Asia, the Americas and Europe. ActionAid was the first big INGO to move its headquarters from the global north to the global south.[4][5] ActionAid's current strategy aims to ""build international momentum for social, economic and environmental justice, driven by people living in poverty and exclusion"".[6]
 ActionAid has been campaigning for tax justice since 2008, conducting research into the effects of various international tax treaties and supporting local people and organisations to hold their governments to account.[7] It argues that losing tax revenue to avoidance harms the world's poorest and most marginalised people, who depend on tax-funded public services.[8][9] It is also often the case that the tax revenue lost in these treaties can exceed the amount of international aid money send to developing countries.[10]
 In 2011, ActionAid revealed that 98% of the UK's FTSE 100 companies use tax havens.[11] In 2013 its research into corporate tax avoidance in Zambia showed that Associated British Foods were avoiding paying millions of dollars in corporate tax.[12]
 ActionAid integrates women's rights into all of its programming and project work, but also undertakes campaigns that focus specifically on these issues.
 Notable examples have included raising awareness about unpaid care work[13][14] and sexual harassment[15] and violence[16] (including acid attacks[17]) in Bangladesh, offering free cancer tests to women in Nigeria who could not afford them,[18] and tackling female genital mutilation in Sweden.[19]
 ActionAid's advocacy work on climate change focuses on climate justice, guided by the experiences and needs of its country programmes. Its most prominent engagement comes through the annual Conference of Parties, where it supports communities vulnerable to climate change to influence decision-making processes.
 It calls for rich countries to live up to pledges of providing climate adaptation grants[20][21][22] and pushes for agreements to improve the lives of those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.[23] ActionAid was also critical of climate insurance policies, such as those purchased by Malawi in 2015, since those insurance policies fail to deliver when they are desperately needed.[24]
 ActionAid promotes women's leadership in humanitarian responses, arguing that women are best positioned to identify their needs and those of the communities around them in times of crisis.[25] Strengthening citizens' rights is also a focus, such as campaigning with Haitians for greater transparency and accountability in how aid money was spent after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[26]
 As it has established relationships with communities and other NGOs in countries that are prone to ecological events, ActionAid is often able to respond quickly to emergencies. Notable crises and responses have included the Boxing Day tsunami in 2010 in the Indian ocean,[27] drought in East Africa[28][29] and India,[30] and floods in Ghana,[31] Rwanda,[32] Sierra Leone,[33] Bangladesh and Nepal.
 ON 4 OCTOBER 2018 ActionAid announced that Pakistan government has ordered 18 international aid groups to leave the country.[34]
 Child sponsorship is one of ActionAid's primary sources of income. Donors sponsor an individual child[35] from a community in a developing country and receive regular updates about the child's progress and development.
 Sponsorship funds support the child's whole community, ""so children have a healthy and safe place to live and grow up."" This support takes the form of providing clean water, healthcare, agricultural programmes, education centres in areas where schools are not available, and community income generation schemes.[36]
 As ActionAid has grown in influence, building alliances with like-minded organisations has become a key focus area. Announcing this approach at the World Social Forum in 2015,[37] ActionAid has played a role in convening civil society and community groups to tackle issues of youth political participation in the Middle East[38] and global inequality.[39]
 ActionAid made India's first Bollywood film focusing on AIDS,[citation needed] Ek Alag Mausam, a love story involving HIV positive people, based on a script by playwright Mahesh Dattani.[40]
 ActionAid also supported Shyam Benegal's film, Samar, which is based on the book Unheard Voices: Stories of Forgotten Lives by Harsh Mander.[41] The film raises issues about Dalits.[40]
 Charity Navigator recorded that in 2012 ActionAid USA had a high cost of fund raising (24%), with 53% of income spent on projects.[42] This was also reported in an International Business Times article in October 2014, which noted that the ""accounting processes the charity uses resulted in its administrative costs appearing to be 'particularly high' in the fiscal year ending 2012, the timeframe Charity Navigator relied on when calculating its current Charity Navigator score.""[43] Charity Navigator reports that for 2013 the cost of fundraising for ActionAid USA was much lower (9.4%), with 82.4% of income spent on projects.[42]
 ActionAid has been criticized for  spreading unsupported claims and ""grotesque"" pictures of adverse effects from  consumption of some  genetically engineered crops in Africa,  in particular the unsupported claim of genetically engineered crops causing tumors and cancer. The organization apologized for their misleading actions in 2015, after publication in the media.[44][45]
 ActionAid, who had supported coffee growing in 2000 and had earlier openly agitated against the democratically elected Haitian government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide,[46] is with a number of other NGOs, strongly criticized for supporting the US-backed coup that removed this, the first democratically elected president of Haiti in 2004, a coup which is described as ""perhaps the most successful act of imperial sabotage since the end of the Cold War"".[47]"
Acumen	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acumen_(organization)	"Acumen (formerly known as Acumen Fund[1]) is a non-profit impact investment fund with over 15 years’ experience in investing in social enterprises that serve low-income communities in developing countries across Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Latin America, and the United States.[2][3] It aims to demonstrate that small amounts of philanthropic capital, combined with large doses of business acumen can result in thriving enterprises that serve vast numbers of the poor.[4] Over the years, Acumen has invested $115 million in 113 companies and has had a successful track record in sourcing and executing investment opportunities in the clean energy, health care and agriculture sectors.[5]
 Acumen's philosophy is that a bigger impact can be made on poverty by giving people the chance to earn their living by investing in goods, structure and human capital rather than straightforward philanthropy.[6] This vision evolves into investing in companies whose products and services enable the poor to transform their lives, people who have the ability to lead and ideas that innovate and accelerate solutions to poverty.[7]
 Acumen was founded in 2001 by Jacqueline Novogratz who gave up her job in Investment Banking to work in International Development.[8][circular reference] The idea of Acumen started from one of Novogratz's trip to Central Africa, back when she was still in the banking industry with Chase Bank[9][circular reference] (formerly Chase Manhattan Bank), where she noticed that banks did not lend to poor people. Soon after, she quit her job, relocated to Rwanda and opened Duterimbere, the first micro-finance bank in the country. It started as a money-lending venture where it provided women with small loans to promote women's entrepreneurship at the grass-root level with an aim to contribute to the income of low-income working women. Novogratz's biggest challenge was convincing women that it was an authentic venture alongside explaining the ways in which it could increase their income and pull them out of poverty. Her cause was strengthened when she got 3 women parliamentarians to back her project and it grew to 2000 members from five provinces in 11 districts across Rwanda.[10]
 After Duterimbere, Novogratz wanted to do something bigger. At the apex of her imagination was an entity that would provide social enterprises with the tools to empower the working poor. In 2001, with help of Seed Capital from the Rockefeller Foundation, Cisco Systems Foundations and 3 individual philanthropists, she founded Acumen.[11] Acumen uses a business mechanism to fight poverty, investing in for-profit businesses that treat the poor as customers.[12]
 Acumen's investment model is to invest as equity or debt in enterprises, either for-profit or non-profit organizations, that are serving Bottom of Pyramid Markets.[13] In choosing these organizations, Acumen focuses on companies working on one or more of the five portfolio areas namely water, healthcare, housing, energy and agriculture. It invests not only in the form of financial capital but also its human and knowledge capital through assistance in business areas including business strategy, planning and performance management.[14]
 Innovative Companies:
 At Acumen, investment is made in companies that statistically have the greatest chance at lowering poverty by manufacturing and subsequently selling goods or services. Those companies are provided the seed capital that maximizes their reach in order to get to the most amount of poor people alongside providing the flexibility and security to grow their businesses.[15]
 Human capital:
 Acumen has developed a Global and Regional Fellows Program that provides individuals with the knowledge, guidance and practical techniques to drive social change in developing countries to eradicate poverty and build a more tolerant world.[16]
 Impactful Ideas:
 Acumen has a carefully coordinated way of measuring and evaluating ideas and how much they hit the target they set out to achieve. Aligning business priorities with impact priorities allows it to have social impact in the sector.[17]
 WaterHealth International:
 In 2004, Acumen invested in WaterHealth International, a for-profit organization that supplies clean water to the poor population in rural India, Ghana and the Philippines. Acumen partners with the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank and Dow Chemical Venture Fund to supply, people in rural areas of third world countries, clean supply of water alongside earning a substantial gross margin that keeps these hybrid enterprises thriving.[18]
 PEG Africa:
In 2017, Acumen invested in PEG Africa, the leading pay-as-you-go solar home system distribution company in West Africa. PEG Africa launched in Ghana in 2015, and today serves customers across Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal, bringing affordable solar products to those who do not have access to the electrical grid.
 When investing in businesses, Acumen measures success in the number of lives reached in bottom of pyramid[19][circular reference] markets. For them, success is correlated with the social change that occurs in people's lives. For example, when looking to invest in a company that makes and distributes anti-malarial bed nets, Acumen uses numbers to measure the social impact of this company. This means that the more number of anti-malarial beds manufactured and distributed, the more impact the company made. If a company builds toilets and shower facilities in urban slums and business districts, the success of this is measured by the number of times the toilet and shower facilities are used.[20]
 Acumen measures the immediate output and considers it when looking for businesses to invest in. It doesn't go further in investigating whether these social changes is contributing to decrease in malaria or improvement in health and environment. Its former CEO, Brian Trelstad argues that the latter approach is complicated, expensive and impractical for emerging companies. Instead, Acumen measures between output and impact i.e. distribution of beds to reduction of malaria.[21]
 Pursuing Venture Philosophy, Acumen's Modus operandi[22][circular reference] is investing in enterprises that are innovating with an intent to eradicate poverty, with a potential for growth and return on investment. Investment in companies pursuing these ideas would yield below-market financial returns and therefore the returns are pooled back into Acumen's financial resources for future investments alongside enabling the investments to stand on their own. These financial returns, although not substantial, are critical in pursuing the organization's objectives of supporting significant social impact. Another way Acumen measures growth is thorough the impact of venture philanthropy by investing in companies that have a sustainable business model while having the ability to support its operating expenses with operating revenues within a 5-7 year period. Another investment criteria that an organization is scrutinized with is the ability to have its product reach a million end customers within the same 5-7 year period.[23]
 Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation:
 Cisco, Sapling Foundation
 The Clinton Foundation:
 The challenges in this initiative involve difficulty in accessing and adopting beneficial agricultural innovations as well as the company's challenge in providing it and still remaining profitable. This partnership helps in overcoming these challenges by developing repeatable models to scale the adoption of agricultural innovations.[30]
 LifeSpring Hospitals:
 LifeSpring hospitals is a joint venture of Acumen and Hindustan Latex Limited to provide women with a cheaper and accessible way of childbirth. It started in 2005 when Anant Kumar, CEO of HLL (now known as HLL Lifecare) travelled to hospitals to talk to women about family planning practices and contraceptive use. Kumar found out that most women were unsatisfied with the level of care at public hospitals, some were so frustrated that they would take out loans to finance visits to private facilities.[31] Kumar took the idea of opening a high-quality maternal care institution to low-income families in the sprawling Hyderabad urban slums. The concept involved provision of high quality pre and post natal health care services priced at 50-70% the price of private clinics. The concept was welcomed among the poor population and it was expanded to 9 hospitals in low-income areas by 2009. Its narrow specialization in maternal health care has been instrumental in lowering costs and increasing productivity in its locations. By limiting capital expenditures such as renting hospital buildings on multi year leases, outsourcing pharmacy and laboratory services and reducing the amount of machinery to only those necessary in performing a safe normal delivery, LifeSpring hospitals has brought the cost down to make it accessible to the poor population.[32]
[33]
 Through its process-driven model, LifeSpring has filled a void in the Indian healthcare landscape. Its developmental goals are to reduce maternal and child mortality while achieving financial sustainability. It ensures that more babies are born with qualified physicians rather than at home in high-risk situations. Additional income generated apart from deliveries is attributed to family planning services, consultation fees and rent from outsourced laboratory and pharmacy.[34]
 In December 2013, LifeSpring Hospitals decided to raise $3.2 million to fund its expansion plan and to set up another maternity home.[35]"
Adelson Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelson_Foundation	"The Adelson Foundation is an American private charitable foundation founded by business magnate Sheldon and Miriam Adelson. The organization is based in Los Angeles.
 The foundation is divided into two branches, including the Adelson Family Foundation, which was established in 2007, and the Adelson Medical Research Foundation. The former works to strengthen the State of Israel and the Jewish people,[2] while the latter focuses on healthcare.[3]
 Noteworthy donations of the organization include: $50 million to the Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Educational Campus, another $67 million in total was donated to their Medical Research Foundation, and $33 million to the Birthright Israel Foundation, and $13 million toward paying for the promotional trips to Israel that the nonprofit organizes for young Jewish people.[4]
 In addition, the couple have pledged $3 million to Hebrew SeniorLife for housing facilities and a program to bring together older people and elementary-school students for education programs; $2 million to Gateways: Access to Jewish Education for programs for children with special needs; and $1 million to the Chelsea Jewish Foundation for specialized housing for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. Those pledges will be paid over five years,[4] and since 2007, the Adelson Family Foundation has made contributions totalling $140 million to Birthright Israel, which finances Jewish youth trips to Israel.[5]
 The Adelson Foundation gives $200 million annually to Jewish and Israeli causes, the largest by far of any existing private foundation with that aim.[4]
 The foundation funds the Maccabee Task Force, which combats antisemitism on college and university campuses in the United States.[6]"
Adventist Development and Relief Agency	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventist_Development_and_Relief_Agency	"Divisions 
 The Adventist Development and Relief Agency International (ADRA or ADRA International) is a humanitarian agency operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church for the purpose of providing individual and community development and disaster relief. It was founded in 1956, and it is headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, United States of America.
 In 2004, ADRA reported assisting nearly 24 million people with more than US$159 million in aid. Its staff numbered over 4,000 members.[1] As of the end of 2007, it had operations in 125 countries [2] According to Forbes, in 2005, ADRA ranked among America's 200 largest charities.[3]
 ADRA's mission statement  is: ""ADRA works with people in poverty and distress to create just and positive change through empowering partnerships and responsible actions.[2]  ADRA says the reason for its existence is ""to follow Christ's example by being a voice for, serving, and partnering with those in need"".[4]
 The 1983 organizational documents for ADRA include a biblical rationale for conducting humanitarian work:[5]
 ADRA partners with communities, organizations, and governments in order to develop: 
 ADRA says that it serves people without discriminating their ethnic, political, or religious association. Priority is given to those with disabilities, children, and senior citizens.[6]
 ADRA's areas of expertise include: Education, Emergencies, Food/nutrition, HIV/AIDS, Health, Refugees and IDPs, Shelter, Training and development, Water and sanitation, Women, Children, Monitoring and Evaluation, Programme management, and Security.[7]
 A Los Angeles Times story from 1998 reports on ADRA's 1996 10-year strategic plan, which calls the agency ""a bona fide ministry of Jesus Christ and the Seventh-day Adventist Church"" and ""provides a strategy to reach people previously untouched by other church institutions. The church's mission is incomplete without ADRA's distinctive ministry.""[8] Much has been said about faith-based agencies taking US government funding and using those funds to further religious doctrinal missions, however ADRA does not proselytise. It claims to operate ""by love with no strings attached"".[9] As a global organisation, ADRA is a signatory of the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief, which states that ""aid will not be used to further a particular political or religious standpoint"", that ""aid is given regardless of the race, creed, or nationality"", and that organizations ""shall respect culture and custom."" [10]
 ADRA was established as the Seventh-day Adventist Welfare Service (SAWS) in November 1956. The name was changed to Seventh-day Adventist World Service in 1973.[1]
 In 1983, the organisation was renamed the 'Adventist Development and Relief Agency' to better reflect its missions and activities.
 In 1996 ADRA and Andrews University established the ADRA Professional Leadership Institute (APLI). The institute provided field-based training and continuing professional education to ADRA staff around the world. By the year 2000, the APLI program was used as a model by the Food Aid Management members as an example of ""best practices for local capacity building."" The model was well received by Africare, World Vision, and others.[11] By 2003, the ADRA and Andrews University partnership offered a master's degree in International Development. More than 160 students had graduated. Sixty of those graduates had moved into management positions across the network. Seventh-day Adventist institutions of higher education on four continents offered degrees in International Development.[12]
 The United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) granted ADRA general Consultative Status in 1997.[11]
 So far in 2014, ADRA International has responded to approximately 60 emergencies worldwide, by which more than 127,000 people have directly benefited."
Aerospace Heritage Foundation of Canada	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_Heritage_Foundation_of_Canada	"The Aerospace Heritage Foundation of Canada is a federally chartered and non-profit organization based in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario, that is dedicated to preserving and promoting the achievements of the Canadian aerospace industry.
 In March 1988 a group of ex-Avro Canada employees and other aviation enthusiasts held a 30th Anniversary Dinner and Reunion to celebrate the First Flight of the Avro Arrow. The then Science Specialist with Citytv Toronto David C. Onley, the current Honourable Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, proposed that a full-scale replica model of the Avro Arrow be constructed. This would provide Canadians with a physical legacy for future generations to see and appreciate and to understand the technological base that became Canada's Aerospace Industry today.
 As a result of this suggestion a committee was formed with Mr. David Onley as President along with James C. Floyd, former Vice President Engineering Avro Canada, Mario Pesando, Syd Britton, Nicholas Doran, Jim Mitchell, Eddy Metz, Bill Turner and Ray Gibson. Their discussions led to the formation in the summer of 1988 of the Canadian Aerospace Heritage Foundation.
 In the spring of 1989 the name was changed to the Aerospace Heritage Foundation of Canada and the first Annual Report was presented in December 1989.[citation needed]
 The A.H.F.C. is made up of a Board of Directors (consisting of a President and various Directors), General Membership, and various other volunteers. The Board of Directors meets approximately 9 times per year along with an Annual General Membership Meeting.
 The A.H.F.C. also has had various Patrons over the years. In March 1990, James (Jim) C. Floyd was named Patron of the A.H.F.C. He resigned at the end of May 1997 and was succeeded by Colonel (hon) William (Bill) Coyle, O StJ, O.Ont. Bill Coyle was employed by Avro Aircraft Ltd. Malton Ontario in the Experimental Flight Test Engineering Group and is Honorary Colonel Canadian Forces School of Aerospace Technology and Engineering.
 A major focus of the A.H.F.C over the years has been the organizing of Dinners and Reunions to commemorate Avro and Orenda's achievements including such things as the founding of Orenda, the first flight of the Avro Jetliner, Avro CF-100 and the Avro Arrow.
 Another area of contributions has been in awards and bursaries. March 1990 saw the establishment of the ""James C. Floyd Award for Outstanding Contribution to Canadian Aerospace"" with Test Pilot Janusz Zurakowski as the first recipient. The issuing of the award was passed on to the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada in 2010 with it being awarded for the first time through them in October 2010.
 The A.H.F.C. supports the 845 Avro Arrow Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets by sponsoring two annual awards, ""The James C. Floyd Trophy"" for Outstanding Engineering Excellence and the ""Janusz Zurakowski Trophy"" for Gliding Excellence. A bursary is also presented to the recipients for each of these awards .
 The A.H.F.C. also conducts various educational efforts including displays at various venues and lectures to interested groups. They loan out selected artifacts from their collection to museums. Some of these items can be seen at places like the Ontario Science Centre and the Canadian Air and Space Museum.
 In 1995 for the 50th Anniversary of the Avro Canada CF100 the A.H.F.C. raised monies for the refurbishment of a CF100 mounted on a pedestal at Derry Road next to the Orenda Plant in Malton Ontario.
 Over the years since its formation the A.H.F.C. has also conducted an underwater search in Lake Ontario in an attempt to recover one or more of the Avro Arrow Aerodynamic Test Models fired aboard a Nike (rocket) over the lake. Much interest in this project has been expressed with programs such as the History Channel, Discovery Channel, and the National Geographic Channel. The Sea Hunters have also produced a program on the A.H.F.C. involvement in the ongoing search for the models.
In 2004 the Canadian Navy along with A.H.F.C. members, using two Navy vessels as a training exercise, conducted searches of areas previously identified in 2003. Search efforts have continued in a limited capacity in the years since through other organizations.
 A memorial is currently in progress in tribute of the memory of Flight-Lieutenant Bruce Warren of Toronto and Avro Engineer Bob Ostrander of Brampton both of whom died in the crash of the second prototype Avro CF-100 #18102. It crashed on Thursday April 5, 1951, at 10:50am near Komoka Ontario."

Alexander S. Onassis Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_S._Onassis_Foundation	"The Alexander S. Onassis Foundation was created by Aristotle Onassis to honor the memory of his son Alexander, who died at age 24 in an airplane crash in 1973. Aristotle Onassis died in 1975, and had directed in his will that half of his estate should be transferred upon his own death to a foundation to be established in Alexander's name.[1][2] In 1975, the executors of the estate accordingly established a pair of foundations, incorporated in Vaduz, Liechtenstein: the Business Foundation, which acts as a holding company for the underlying business interests, and the Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation, which is the sole beneficiary of the Business Foundation. The public benefit foundation is based in Athens, Greece.[3] Aristotle's daughter, Christina Onassis, was the first president of the foundation.[4]
 The foundation is one of the largest in Europe, using its assets to create scholarship and prize programs, build the $75 million Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center in Athens (designed by London-based hospital architect Llewelyn Davies), endow Greek studies chairs at universities, and support other projects.[4] All activities of the Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation, from the time of its establishment to the present, are funded exclusively by the profits of the Business Foundation, which engages mainly in shipping and real estate investments.
 Culture, education, the environment, health, and social achievement are the main priorities of the Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation. Carrying out Aristotle Onassis' and Maria Callas' original wishes, all the activities of the Foundation are exclusively related to Greece and Greek civilization.[5]
 Each foundation (Public Benefit and Business) is run separately, by its respective Board of 15 elected Directors. The current President and Treasurer for both Foundations is Anthony S. Papadimitriou.[9][10]"
Allegheny Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_Foundation	"The Scaife Foundations refer collectively to three foundations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The three subdivisions are: the Allegheny Foundation, the Sarah Scaife Foundation, and the Scaife Family Foundation. A fourth foundation, the Carthage Foundation, was folded into the Sarah Scaife Foundation in 2014.[1]
 Richard Mellon Scaife endowed the foundation and served as the chairman.  It makes grants to historical, educational, political, and pro- and anti-environmental organizations, especially those located in or serving Western Pennsylvania.  From 1985 to 2006 the foundation awarded over $36 million to other organizations.[2]
 In 2007, the Allegheny Foundation made grants of $3,195,500 to 45 organizations.  The five organizations receiving the largest grants were:[3]
 The 2007 annual report also noted that, at the end of that year, the foundation had nearly $55 million in cash and common stocks.
 The Sarah Scaife Foundation does not award grants to individuals.  It concentrates its efforts towards politically conservative causes focused on public policy at a national and international level.[4] From 1985 to 2003 the organization awarded over $235 million to other organizations.
 The organizations it has supported include the George C. Marshall Institute, Project for the New American Century, the Institute for Humane Studies,[5] Reason Foundation,[6] and Judicial Watch.
 Prior to its 2014 merger, like the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the Carthage Foundation did not award grants to individuals.  It concentrated its efforts towards causes focused on public policy at a national and international level.  From 1985 to 2003 the organization awarded over $68 million to other organizations.
 The Scaife Family Foundation does not award grants to individuals.[citation needed]  It concentrates its efforts towards causes focused on families, women, children, and animal welfare.  From 1985 to 2001 the organization awarded over $77 million to other organizations.[citation needed]

The Alliance for Safe Children	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alliance_for_Safe_Children	"The Alliance for Safe Children (TASC) is a non-profit organization formed in 2002 to address the issue of child injury in the developing world.[1] The founder is Pete Peterson, former United States Ambassador to Vietnam.[2] Michael Linnon is the technical director.[3]
 TASC works in cooperation with other organizations, such as the Red Cross and UNICEF.[4][5]
Its aims include raising awareness of child injury; promoting injury prevention programmes; conducting and supporting research;[6] and 
raising funds and creating alliances with NGOs, international organisations and governments so that the number of child injuries can be reduced.[1]
TASC's objectives are driven in part by studies suggesting that far more children die from preventable injury than from infectious disease - according to UNICEF about one million children die of preventible injuries each year.[2] A common specific cause of death is drowning.[7]
 They worked with UNICEF, with whom they organized a conference in 2004 that reported on their findings from surveys and research; the keynote speaker was Kul Gautam, Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and Deputy Executive Director of UNICEF, who praised TASC and its founder.[8] The conference, according to a report to the Executive Board of UNICEF, was to lead to ""the development of programmes on child injury prevention.""[9] In 2008 the results of their seven-year ""groundbreaking study""[5] were published, in a report that indicated that suffocation and drowning were the most easily preventable causes of death for children under five years of age.[10] The publication of the report generated interest from printed media around the world[11][12][13] and from Australian television.[14]
 Since 2005, TASC has assisted organizations in providing swimming lessons for children in Bangladesh.[15]  With help from the Australian government, TASC partnered with the Royal Life Saving Society Australia, in establishing an International Drowning Research Centre based in Dhaka and opened in August 2010.[16][17][18]  In Bangladesh, an estimated 46 children drown each day, and four times as many nearly drown.[19] The aim is to teach children, especially those from poorer sections of society, how to swim, with the focus being on teaching older children ""who can not only save themselves but can also help others.""  The centre also teaches cardiopulmonary resuscitation and basic rescue skills.[3]"
American Academy in Rome	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_in_Rome	"The American Academy in Rome is a research and arts institution located on the Gianicolo (Janiculum Hill) in Rome.
The academy is a member of the Council of American Overseas Research Centers.[1]
 In 1893, a group of American architects, painters and sculptors met regularly while planning the fine arts section of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The group discussed the idea of forming an American school for artists in Europe as a place for American artists to study and further their skills. Led by Charles F. McKim of architectural practice McKim, Mead & White, they decided that Rome, which they considered a veritable museum of masterpieces of painting, sculpture and architecture throughout the ages, would be the best location for the school. The program began with institutions such as Columbia University and University of Pennsylvania, who would provide scholarships to artists to fund their travel to Rome. In October 1894 the American School of Architecture opened temporarily at the Palazzo Torlonia; directed by Austin W. Lord, it had three fellows, one visiting student, and a library with one volume. In July 1895, the program moved into the larger Villa Aurora. Renting space out to the American School of Classical Studies and the British & American Archeological Society Library, and financial contributions from McKim, allowed for the school to remain open.[2]
 In 1895, the American School of Architecture in Rome was incorporated in New York state and 10 shares of capital stock were issued. Despite fund-raising efforts and the American School of Classical Studies pulling out of Villa Aurora, the organization struggled financially. McKim made up for the financial loss with his personal funds. These struggles would cause the American School of Architecture to restructure and base their program on the French Academy. In June 1897, the institution dissolved itself and formed the American Academy in Rome.[2] Among its incorporators was Charles Moore.[3]
 The Academy introduced bills to the U.S. Congress to make it a ""national institution,"" which was successful.[4] In 1904, the Academy moved into Villa Mirafiore, which was soon purchased and renovated. They formed an endowment, which raised over a million dollars, designating those having donated over $100,000 as founders. These founders included: McKim, Harvard College, The Carnegie Foundation, J.P. Morgan, J.P. Morgan, Jr., John D. Rockefeller, Jr., The Rockefeller Foundation, William K. Vanderbilt, Henry Walters, and others.[2] Ever since, the American Academy has always been primarily privately financed.[5] Today, financing comes from private donations as well as grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.[6]
 In 1912, the American School of Classical Studies in Rome merged with the Academy, giving the Academy two wings: one that focuses on fine art and one, classical studies. Women were a part of the School of Classical Studies, but were not permitted participation in the School of Fine Arts until after World War II.[2] Since 1914, Joseph Brodsky, Aaron Copland, Nadine Gordimer, Mary McCarthy, Philip Guston, Frank Stella, William Styron, Michael Graves, Robert Venturi, Robert Penn Warren, Oscar Hijuelos and Elizabeth Murray, among others, have come to the Academy for inspiration.[5] The Centennial Directory of the American Academy in Rome documented the lives and careers of nearly 1,400 Fellows and Residents of the Academy from the Academy's founding in 1894 to its centenary in 1994.[7]
 From 1970 to 1973, art historian Bartlett H. Hayes Jr. was director of the Academy.[8] Classicist John H. D'Arms was both the resident director of the American Academy and a professor in its School of Classical Studies from 1977 to 1980.[9] Between 1980 and 1984, director Sophie Consagra strengthened the Academy's ties with the Roman community and the Italian Government.[10] In her tenure as president from 1988 and 2013, Adele Chatfield-Taylor, helped restore the Academy’s McKim, Mead & White building at a cost of $8.2 million[5] and oversaw a capital campaign in which the institution’s endowment grew to $100 million. She also brought on Alice Waters to create the Rome Sustainable Food Project, which brings chefs from the United States to explore Italian sustainable food traditions and to cook for the Academy guests.
 From 2010 to 2014, Christopher Celenza was director of the Academy.[11] He was succeeded by Kimberly Bowes.[12] Mark Robbins became president and CEO of the Academy in January 2014.[13]
 The Academy serves as a ""home"" to visiting U.S. scholars and artists having been awarded the Rome Prize. Given each year to up to 30 (15 artist and 15 scholars) of more than 1,000 applicants,[14] the Rome Prize is awarded for work in the following fields: classical studies, ancient studies, medieval studies, modern Italian studies, architecture, design, historic preservation, art conservation, landscape architecture, musical composition, visual art, and literature. The Rome Prize includes terms that range from six months to two years fellowships at the academy; a stipend ($16,000 for six month and $28,000 for one year fellowships); and work and living space at the 11-acre campus.
 In addition to Rome Prize Fellows, visiting scholars and artists live and/or work at the Academy for varying periods.[2]
 The Academy is housed in several buildings.  The main building was designed by the firm of McKim, Mead, and White and opened in 1914. Located under the floor of the basement of the main building lies a segment of the Aqua Traiana that was discovered in 1912-1913.[1] The courtyard has a fountain designed by sculptor Paul Manship. Architect Michael Graves designed the rare books library in 1996.
 The Academy also owns the Villa Aurelia,[2] a country estate built for Cardinal Girolamo Farnese in 1650.  The building served as Giuseppe Garibaldi's headquarters during the French siege of Rome in 1849.  The villa was heavily damaged during the assault, but it was restored.  It was then purchased by Philadelphia heiress Clara Jessup Heyland.  Heyland died in 1909, bequeathing the villa to the Academy in her will.[2]
 A portion of the aqueduct Aqua Traiana and the ruins of the watermills fed by the aqueduct are on the grounds of the Academy.  From the third to the sixth century CE, the Aqua Traiana carried water to operate a number of water mills used for grinding grain, mostly wheat, into flour to make bread, the most important item in the Roman diet. The ancient city of Rome had to import large amounts of grain from Egypt, North Africa, and Sicily to feed its population, estimated at about one million people at its peak. The mills on Janiculum Hill and on the site of the Academy were the second largest complex of water mills known in the ancient world. The provision of grain to the residents of Rome was called the Cura Annonae. The aqueduct and the watermills were excavated in the 1990s.[15]"
American Heart Association	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Heart_Association	"The American Heart Association (AHA) is a non-profit organization in the United States that funds cardiovascular medical research[1], educates consumers on healthy living[2] and fosters appropriate cardiac care in an effort to reduce disability and deaths caused by cardiovascular disease and stroke. Originally formed in New York City in 1924 as the Association for the Prevention and Relief of Heart Disease,[3] it is currently headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The American Heart Association is a national voluntary health agency.
 They are known for publishing guidelines on cardiovascular disease and prevention, standards on basic life support and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), and in 2014  issued its first guidelines for preventing strokes in women.[4] They are known also for operating a number of highly visible public service campaigns starting in the 1970s, and also operate a number of fundraising events. In 1994, the Chronicle of Philanthropy, an industry publication, released a study that showed the American Heart Association was ranked as the 5th ""most popular charity/non-profit in America.""[5]  The Association was listed as the 22nd largest charity by Forbes in 2018[6].
 The mission of the organization, updated in 2018, is ""To be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives.""[7]
 The American Heart Association grew out of a set of smaller precursor groups. The primary precursor was the Association for the Prevention and Relief of Heart Disease, formed in New York City in 1915, to study whether patients with heart disease could safely return to work. Several similar organizations formed or evolved in Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago in the 1920s. Recognizing the need for a national organization to share research and promote findings, the American Heart Association was formed in 1924 by six cardiologists representing several of these precursor groups.[3]
 The AHA remained small until the 1940s when it was selected for support by Procter & Gamble, via their PR firm, from a list of applicant charities. Procter & Gamble gave $1.5 million from its radio show, Truth or Consequences, allowing the organization to go national.[8] Proctor & Gamble turned cottonseeds from a waste product of cotton production into something that could be sold as a supposedly ""heart-healthy"" alternative to its competition - animal fats, which were mostly saturated. Proctor & Gamble were the inventors of the fake trans-fat margarine called Crisco (Crystallized Cottonseed Oil), which was touted by the AHA as healthier than butter. We now know that the artificial trans-fat from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are extremely unhealthy for us. However, the trans fat CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) from grass-fed cows is considered healthy and is even widely sold as a supplement.
 Recommendations regarding limiting saturated fats and cholesterol emerged from a series of scientific studies in the 1950s, and related American Heart Association dietary guidelines emerged between 1957 and 1961. The 1957 AHA report included: (1) Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, (2) The fat content and total calories in the diet are probably important factors, (3) The ratio between saturated and unsaturated fat may be the basic determinant, and (4) A wide variety of other factors beside fat, both dietary and non-dietary, may be important. By 1961, these finding had been strengthened, leading to the new 1961 AHA recommendations: (1) Maintain a correct body weight, (2) Engage in moderate exercise, e.g., walking to aid in weight reduction, (3) Reduce intake of total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. Increase intake of polyunsaturated fat, (4) Men with a strong family history of atherosclerosis should pay particular attention to diet modification, and (5) Dietary changes should be carried out under medical supervision. These recommendations continued to become more precise from 1957 to 1980, but maintained ""a general coherence among them"".[9]
 In 1994, the Chronicle of Philanthropy, an industry publication, released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organization popularity and credibility. The study showed that the American Heart Association was ranked as the 5th ""most popular charity/non-profit in America"" of over 100 charities researched with 95% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing Love and Like A lot description category.[5]
 In 2003 published the “Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure” (JNC 7).[10]
 On October 28, 2009 The American Heart Association and the Ad Council launched a hands-only CPR public service announcement and website.[11] On November 30, 2009, The American Heart Association announced a new cardiac arrest awareness campaign called Be the Beat.[12] The campaign's aim is to teach 12- to 15-year-olds fun ways to learn the basics of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and how to use an automated external defibrillator.
 In 2004 the AHA launched the ""Go Red for Women"" campaign[13] specifically targeting women, with information about risks and action they can take to protect their health. All revenues from the local and national campaigns go to support awareness, research, education and community programs to benefit women.[14]
 It also carried out a campaign in 2012 to educate more people on how to carry out hands-only CPR.[15][16][17] The 2012 campaign, which began in New York City, had Jennifer Coolidge as the spokesperson.[18]
 In 2014, the American Heart Association issued its first guidelines for preventing strokes in women.[4]
 In 2015, the American Heart Association officially endorsed the Tobacco 21 campaign, urging local, state and national governments to raise the tobacco and nicotine sales age from 18 to 21.[19]
 In 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology issued new guidelines for clinicians on the management of cholesterol as a way to reduce risk for heart attack and stroke. Newly included in the guidelines is a recommendation to use coronary artery calcium score if healthcare providers are having difficulty deciding if a patient could benefit from statin medications or should focus solely on lifestyle modifications. The cholesterol guidelines were last updated in 2013. [20]

American Himalayan Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Himalayan_Foundation	"The American Himalayan Foundation (AHF) is a non-profit organization in the United States that helps Tibetans, Sherpas, and Nepalis living throughout the Himalayas. AHF builds schools, plants trees, trains doctors, funds hospitals, takes care of children and the elderly, and restores sacred sites. The San Francisco-based organization also helps Tibetans rebuild and maintain their culture both in exile and inside Tibet.
 It was founded by Richard C. Blum. The late Sir Edmund Hillary was a Director of the foundation for more than 20 years.
 The American Himalayan Foundation was established by San Francisco financier Richard Blum after his first trip through the mountains of Nepal in 1968.  During this trip he developed an interest in the local people and the poverty in which they lived.  Blum started helping Sherpa children informally, and in 1980 he set up the American Himalayan Foundation (AHF).[1]  Because many people in Nepal and Tibet live without healthcare, education, clean water, or bridges connecting remote villages; Blum created the foundation to address these problems.
 The foundation's first partner was Sir Edmund Hillary, assisting the Sherpas through his Himalayan Trust.  Also in the early years, the 14th Dalai Lama requested that AHF help the growing number of Tibetan refugees in Nepal and India.  AHF has provided education, healthcare, and basic assistance to Tibetans for over 20 years.[2]  As AHF grew, the 501 (c)(3) charity continued to work with the Sherpas and Tibetans in exile, but expanded its geographic reach to people throughout Nepal, inside Tibet, and in Bhutan.  The foundation helps the most vulnerable: poor children and the elderly, girls in remote villages at risk of being trafficked, disabled children, refugees, and people in need of medical care.
 All AHF-supported projects involve community participation, in order to build local capacity and to ensure the foundation is responding to community needs.  Funds are not used to pay for western volunteers.  All the donations raised by the foundation go directly to helping Sherpas, Nepalis, and Tibetans inside Tibet and in exile.
 AHF supports over 150 projects throughout the Himalayas and touches the lives of 300,000 people each year. The foundation provides healthcare through community clinics, the training of local healthcare workers, and the Hospital and Rehabilitation Center for Disabled Children in Banepa.  AHF educates over fifteen thousand children a year, including ten thousand girls who would otherwise be vulnerable to being trafficked to brothels in India.  The foundation developed the Tibetan Enterprise Fund to help Tibetan refugees in Nepal and India, who lack the same rights as citizens, start income generating businesses.  AHF also supports orphanages, day care centers for the very young, care for the disabled, and clean water systems and bridges for nomads in Tibet.  Beginning in 1995, the organization was involved with the restoration of 15th century Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the former Kingdom of Mustang and is also extensively involved with humanitarian work in Mustang.[3]"
American India Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_India_Foundation	"The American India Foundation (AIF, founded 2001) is a nonprofit American organization that is devoted to accelerating social and economic change in India. The AIF has partnered with 227 of India's NGOs to build a trusted network for implementation, scale, and sustainability while raising over $84 million since its inception.[2] It is one of the largest secular, non-partisan American organizations supporting development work in India.
 AIF awards grants to education, livelihood, and public health projects in India – with emphases on elementary education, women's empowerment, and HIV/AIDS, respectively.[3] AIF has a program called Digital Equalizer which attempts to bridge the digital divide by providing computers, internet access and training to under-resourced Indian schools.[4] It also funds the Service Corps Fellowship, renamed the William J. Clinton Fellowship for Service to India on May 11, 2009, which sends skilled young Americans to work with NGOs in India for a ten-month period. The fellowship helps exchange technical skills, intellectual resources and helps increase the capacity of Indian NGOs to continue their work while giving American leaders a good understanding of India.[5]
 The American India Foundation was founded by a group of Indian-Americans responding to the 2001 Gujarat earthquake. Former United States President Bill Clinton serves as the Honorary Chair, and has been involved in a number of AIF events; he was asked to get involved with the group by Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the wake of the earthquake.[6]
 In cases of major national disasters in India, AIF has been involved in relief and rehabilitation efforts. It has undertaken three campaigns for relief and rehabilitation:
 AIF takes a multi-phased approach to disaster relief: relief, reconstruction and rehabilitation. AIF's focus is the long-term rehabilitation of communities, and it dedicates most of its resources to this phase. In Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, AIF funded organizations in affected communities for up to three years following the earthquake so that NGO partners could identify long-term solutions to improve the lives of people affected by disaster.[7]
 AIF's approach to grant making in the area of elementary education is premised on the following:
 AIF's education grants program, therefore, focuses on complementing and supplementing state efforts in meeting the above commitments. It does this by working with partner NGOs that:
 In all these groups, the focus is on girl children, and children of ethnic/religious minorities.
 Major grants have been awarded to 12 NGO partners in education including Nidan, Janarth, and Bodh[8]
 AIF's focus is to enhance the livelihoods of poor and marginalized communities in rural and urban areas with a particular emphasis on promoting empowered and dignified livelihoods for women, youth, disabled and people living with HIV & AIDS. Broadly, the AIF livelihood strategy is organized around two sub-sectors—rural livelihoods and urban livelihoods--- with micro finance as a cross-cutting theme in both contexts.
 In rural areas, AIF concentrates on those geographies and constituencies that are characterized by being chronically drought-prone, undulating topography, an acute degradation of natural resources, semi-arid climatic conditions and afflicted by shortages of drinking water. In these places, even in years of adequate rainfall, crop distress is caused by the gaps in the rain at critical points of time in the crop growth cycle.
 In such geographies, AIF's emphasis is on improving poor communities, particularly women groups’, with access to and additional control over natural resources, mainly around water and forest. Alternative and sustainable uses of water and forest are promoted in enhancing livelihoods opportunities.
 The link between water and development is recognized in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which set specific targets for water: By 2015, the population which has no sustainable access to safe water resources must be halved.
 AIF partners’ efforts are largely directed towards community mobilization, forming women's self-help groups, and strengthening community-based institutional arrangements. This will ensure the sustainability of these institutions, proactively resolve the competing resource-use conflicts, and bring women's perspectives to the top of the priority list. Particular attention is given to encourage dialogue to resolve contentious issues, allow women to make key decisions and choices, and lay dawn transparent resolution strategies and mechanisms to address conflict resolution. Systematically documenting community watershed works with an objective to learn from different situations - especially on conflict resolution and gender - and influencing the larger discourse and public policy, are of highest priority for AIF.
 In urban areas, AIF's work priorities go beyond large metro cities, i.e. focus on medium and small towns from poorer states in northern and eastern India. Urban population growth is much higher than the rate of overall population growth, and currently an estimated 29% of India's population live in urban areas.
 AIF's approach is to link the urban poor and migrants with various types of self-employment and wage employment opportunities that are emerging in an urban informal sector economy, by taking full advantage of a growing economy, mainly around the growing services, manufacturing and construction sectors. This is accomplished by AIF partners mainly by forming collectives, promoting saving and credit groups, exposure and training on employable skills, linking them up with markets, and promoting group enterprises. Forming groups or collectives of urban poor enable them to better negotiate their terms of engagement. Some of the urban poor who have been mobilized for livelihood enhancement are construction workers, rickshaw pullers, home managers, rag pickers and sweepers, etc.
 Guided by national priorities, AIF is rolling out a new generation of programs under its Public Health portfolio, with a focus on building community investment and ownership. The goal of the program is to reduce mortality and the burden of disease in impoverished and under-served communities by promoting and protecting healthy lifestyles.
 The twin emphasis will be on accelerating health literacy, particularly about preventable and infectious diseases, and strengthening health systems for delivery of quality services.
AIF's interventions will bring private sector resources and ingenuity to drive public health changes for saving lives, particularly those of women and children. Specifically, these investments will: 
 To begin with, the program will be implemented in under-served districts of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh, and in peri-urban and urban slums attached to Delhi and Mumbai. The program delivery will be chiefly through:
 AIF's “William J. Clinton Fellowship for Service in India,” supplements different programs by connecting young American and Indian professionals with Indian NGOs in India for ten-month fellowships to increase NGO capacities and build bridges between the US and India.
 In its vision to build a lasting bridge between the United States and India, the Fellowship has expanded to incorporate young professional Indians to work side by side with fellows from the US, providing an exciting opportunity for the future leaders of both nations to strengthen ties in service to the underprivileged, leading to an ever-greater platform for collaborative learning and impacting our communities in deeper and more profound ways.
 The Fellowship creates a community of socially engaged, global citizens who represent the leaders of tomorrow. Alumni of the program are leaders in international development, academia, journalism, business, entrepreneurship, public health, and other fields. Together they represent a collective force for sustaining a long-term agenda dedicated towards change in India.
 AIF Clinton Fellowship offers the opportunity to capable candidates from India and the US to work on tangible and sustainable projects in the social and developmental sector in India. The Fellows are matched (on the basis of their interest and experience) with and placed at credible and high impact organizations in the social sector for a duration of 10 months where they will work on scalable and sustainable projects. The William J. Clinton Fellowship provides a prestigious platform to develop the skills, resources and the network needed to become the next generation of leaders with a social conscience.[9]"
American Indian College Fund	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_College_Fund	"The American Indian College Fund is a nonprofit organization that helps Native American students, providing them with support through scholarships and funding toward higher education. The Fund provides an average of 6,000 annual scholarships for American Indian students and also provides support for other needs at the tribal colleges ranging from capital support to cultural preservation activities. Charity Navigator gave the College Fund an overall rating of 88.36 out of 100.[1]
 The American Indian College Fund (the College Fund) was established in 1989 as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization to provide American Indians with student scholarships. The College Fund also helps support tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) located on or near Indian reservations through capital grants and programs such as cultural and language preservation, early childhood education programs on-campus for children of students and community members; fellowships for faculty development; and college readiness, internship, career readiness, and leadership development programs.
 Today American Indians account for only 1% of all college students, and 13.6% of American Indians over age 25 years old have a bachelor's degree compared to 29.3% of the overall population.[2] Poverty is part of the reason so few American Indians and Alaska Natives go to college, with current data showing that 28.3% of the American Indian and Alaska Natives living below the poverty level compared to 15.5% of the overall population.[3]
 During the Civil Rights Acts and Native American self-determination movements in 1960s and 1970s, tribal leaders decided there was a need for change in failed federal education policy to improve education for American Indian students to serve their communities, leading to the creation of tribal colleges and universities (TCUs).
 In 1968, the Navajo Nation created the first-of-its-kind educational institution—a college controlled by the tribe, located on the Navajo reservation, to provide a quality higher education to the surrounding community, known as a tribal college and university. TCU presidents established the College Fund in 1989 in New York City to raise private-sector funds for scholarships for American Indian students and to raise money for financial support for the tribal colleges, while broadening awareness of those institutions and the College Fund itself.
 In 2015-16, the College Fund distributed more than $8.1 million in direct support to students, including scholarships, internships, leadership training, career readiness, and other programmatic support. Scholarship recipients are selected on the basis of academic success, financial need, community involvement, and commitment to their tribal communities. To date the College Fund has provided more than 100,000 scholarships since its inception and an average of 6,000 scholarships per year to American Indian students. The College Fund also helps support accredited tribal colleges with research and leadership grants, cultural preservation programs, early childhood education programs, and faculty development fellowships as well as with institutional funding.
 The American Indian College Fund has received top ratings from independent charity evaluators. It earned the Best in America Seal of Excellence from America's Best Charities. Of the one million charities operating in the United States, fewer than 2,000 organizations have been awarded this seal. The College Fund meets the Standards for Charity Accountability of the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance. The College Fund received a B+ rating from Charity Watch. The College Fund received a gold rating from GuideStar in 2017, a four-star rating from Charity Navigator for FY2016, and a three star rating for 2018.[1]
 Originally headquartered in New York City, the College Fund relocated to Denver, Colorado in 2002.
 Tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) are vital to Native Americans and are beneficial to the country as a whole. They help Native communities and students gain a valuable education and also preserve Native language, culture and traditions through language curriculum and American Indian studies.
 Since the first tribal college was established in 1968, the number of tribal colleges and universities has grown to 37 in the United States in 2016.
 According to the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, TCUs are chartered by their respective tribal governments, including the ten tribes within the largest reservations in the United States. They operate more than 75 campuses in 16 states—virtually covering Indian Country—and serve students from well more than 230 federally recognized Indian tribes. TCUs vary in enrollment (size), focus (liberal arts, sciences, workforce development/training), location (woodlands, desert, frozen tundra, rural reservation, urban), and student population (predominantly American Indian). Despite their diversity, tribal identity is the core of every TCU, and they all share the mission of tribal self-determination and service to their respective communities.
 TCUs engage in partnerships with organizations including U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Science Foundation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and universities nationwide to support research and education programs that focus on issues such as climate change, sustainable agriculture, water quality, wildlife population dynamics, and diabetes prevention. Many support distance learning involving state-of-the-art learning environments.
 TCU faculty is engaged in research in many areas including hydrology, molecular cell biology, archaeology, entomology, community health, environmental science, aerospace engineering, and advanced manufacturing processes. The majority of faculty, teaching staff, and administrators hold a master's or doctoral degree. Many faculty and staff members often serve double-duty as counselors and mentors in addition to their teaching and administrative roles.
 TCUs provide services to help students stay in school and complete their studies, such as personal and career counseling, mentoring, tutoring, wellness programs, child care, computer lending programs, and transportation and housing assistance. They also provide services to the wider community they serve and offer health centers, lending libraries, computer centers, and lifelong learning programs.
 TCUs at a glance
 The American Indian College Fund has continued its partnership with Portland, Oregon-based advertising agency partner, Wieden+Kennedy for more than 20 years to educate the public through a series of public service announcements to show the difference a higher education makes in American Indian communities. In 2015 they launched a campaign called 1%,[4] to bring attention to the fact that only 1% of college students in the United States are American Indians. The campaign consists of print and video public service announcements. Wieden+Kennedy is known for its award-winning work for clients such as Nike and Coca-Cola.
 The College Fund's public service announcements have appeared in The New York Times Magazine, Harper's, U.S. News and World Report, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, Comcast, MSNBC, Discovery Networks, and National Geographic channel."
American Near East Refugee Aid	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Near_East_Refugee_Aid	"American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera) is an American 501(c)3 non-governmental organization that provides humanitarian and development aid to the Middle East, specifically, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Jordan. Founded in 1968 in the aftermath of the Six-Day War, Anera initially sought to help the hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians by providing emergency relief. While still providing crisis response, Anera now also addresses the long-term economic and social needs of Palestinians, Lebanese and Jordanians through its health care, education and job creation programs. By helping people meet their fundamental needs, Anera understands its work as an essential component to peace in the Middle East and restoring dignity to the people.
 The largest American NGO operating in the West Bank and Gaza,[1] Anera works closely with local institutions, such as schools, universities, health facilities, cooperatives, municipalities, grassroots communities, and charitable associations to improve the community services they provide. Anera is funded by individual donors and grants from public and private institutions. Anera has received the highest rating (4-stars) by Charity Navigator, an independent evaluator of charities' fiscal management,[2] and meets all twenty of the Better Business Bureau standards for charity accountability.[3]
 Through its programs that alleviate suffering and reduce poverty—the ""beginning and end points on a continuum of human need""—Anera works to help people meet their fundamental necessities.[4] Through both large-scale projects like building reservoirs and smaller projects like installing water tanks on the tops of homes, Anera has many programs that meet people's immediate needs and provide jobs at the same time.[5] Anera has been praised for its transparency and dedication to improving the lives of impoverished communities in the Middle East. In 2011, Anera provided more than $65 million worth of programs to the people of the West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon and Jordan.[6]
 Anera has delivered emergency relief and medical supplies to communities in the Middle East. Anera has built 177 water cisterns and is building or repairing water networks and pipelines in the West Bank and Gaza.[5]
 Anera helps to build new schools, offer after-school programs, train preschool teachers and principals, teach information technology, and support music education. During fiscal year 2007, Anera expanded its Gaza-based preschool teacher-training project to provide employment opportunities for skilled women while developing organizational skills, active learning techniques and communications skills among children and increasing parent and community involvement in the educational process.
 Anera offers community assistance in the form of infrastructure projects and job training programs to help people become entrepreneurs with access to small business loans and job opportunities. During fiscal year 2007, Anera's Emergency Water and Sanitation Project received nearly $4 million in grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development to respond to emergency water and sanitation needs in the West Bank and Gaza, and create short-term employment opportunities for impoverished and outlying Palestinian communities.
 Anera's sponsors children between the ages of 4 and 17 to receive an education in one of seven schools in Lebanon, Gaza or the West Bank. Students who participate in the scholarship program are orphans, come from impoverished households or are in need of physical and rehabilitative support, and might not otherwise have opportunities to receive a regular education.
 In February 2008, Anera partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in a project to install an internal water network in the village of Sarra in the West Bank. According to the USAID press release, the project ""will ensure access to a reliable water supply ... [and will be] funded by USAID and implemented by Anera. The total cost of the project is $255,000 and is anticipated to generate 1,800 days of employment.""[7]"
American Red Cross	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross	"The American Red Cross (ARC), also known as The American National Red Cross,[4] is a humanitarian organization that provides emergency assistance, disaster relief, and disaster preparedness education in the United States. It is the designated US affiliate of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the United States movement to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.
 The organization offers services and development programs.[5]
 ARC was established in Washington, D.C., on May 21, 1881, by Clara Barton. She became its first president. Barton organized a meeting on May 12 of that year at the house of Senator Omar D. Conger (R, MI).[6] Fifteen people were present in this meeting, including Barton, Conger and Representative William Lawrence (R, OH) (who became the first vice president).[7][8] The first local chapter was established in 1881 at the English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Dansville, New York.[9]
 Jane Delano (1862–1919) founded the American Red Cross Nursing Service on January 20, 1910.[10]
 Clara Barton (1821–1912) founded the American chapter after learning of the Red Cross in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1869, she went to Europe and became involved in the work of the International Red Cross during the Franco-Prussian War. She was determined to bring the organization to America.[11]
 Barton became President of the American branch of the society, known as the American National Red Cross in May 1881 in Washington. The first chapters opened in upstate New York, where she had connections.[12] Ultimately, John D. Rockefeller and four others donated money to help create a national headquarters near the White House.[13] Frederick Douglass, famed abolitionist and friend of Clara Barton offered advice and support as Barton sought to establish the American chapter or the global Red Cross network. As Register of Deeds for the District of Columbia, Douglass also signed the original Articles of Incorporation for the American Red Cross.
 Barton led one of the group's first major relief efforts, a response to the September 4–6, 1881 Great Fire of 1881 (Thumb Fire) in the Thumb region of Michigan. Over 5,000 people were left homeless. The next major disaster was the Johnstown Flood, which occurred on May 31, 1889. Over 2,209 people died and thousands more were injured in or near Johnstown, Pennsylvania in one of the worst disasters in United States history.
 Barton was unable to build up a staff she trusted and her fundraising was lackluster. She was forced out in 1904. Professional social work experts took control and made the group a model of Progressive Era scientific reform.[14] New leader Mabel Thorp Boardman constantly consulted with senior government officials, military officers, social workers, and financiers. William Howard Taft was especially influential. They imposed an ethos of ""managerialism"", transforming the agency from Barton's cult of personality to an ""organizational humanitarianism"" ready for expansion.[15]
 Among the notable disasters of the Progressive Era that featured Red Cross involvement was the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912. The New York City chapter joined with the Charity Organization Society to provide funds to survivors and the dependents of those who perished.[16]
 Recent presidents and CEOs include Gail McGovern, Elizabeth Dole, Bernadine Healy, Mary S. Elcano, Mark W. Everson and John F. McGuire.[2] In 2007, U.S. legislation clarified the role for the Board of Governors and that of the senior management in the wake of difficulties following Hurricane Katrina.[17]
 As of November 2017, the American Red Cross scores three out of four stars in Charity Navigator[18] and B+ at CharityWatch.[19]
 In 1996, the Chronicle of Philanthropy, an industry magazine, released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organization popularity and credibility. The study showed that ARC was ranked as the third ""most popular charity/non-profit in America"" of over 100 charities researched with 48% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing ""Love"", and ""Like A lot"" to describe the Red Cross.[20]
 ARC supplies roughly 40% of the donated blood in the United States, which it sells to hospitals and regional suppliers.[26] Community-based blood centers supply 50% and 6% is collected directly by hospitals. In December 2004, ARC completed its largest blood processing facility in the United States in Pomona, California, on the campus grounds of the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.
 For more than 50 years, ARC provided allograft tissue for transplant through sales in its Tissue Services Program. It cared for thousands of donor families who gave the gift of tissue donation and sold donated tissue to more than 1 million transplant recipients in need of this life saving or life-enhancing gift of tissue. At the end of January 2005, ARC ended its Tissue Services program in order to focus on its primary missions of Disaster Relief and Blood Services.
 A leader in the plasma industry, ARC provides more than one-quarter of the nation's plasma products. Red Cross Plasma Services provides plasma products that are reliable, cost-effective and as safe as possible.
 In February 1999, ARC completed its ""Transformation"", a $287 million program that re-engineered Red Cross Blood Services' processing, testing, and distribution system; and established a new management structure.
 As of 2011, ARC was no longer in the Plasma Services industry. The Red Cross supplies Baxter BioSciences with items for the manufacturing of plasma products.[27]
 On March 1, 1999, ARC became the first U.S. blood bank to implement a Nucleic acid testing (NAT) study. This process is different from traditional testing because it looks for the genetic material of HIV and hepatitis C (HCV), rather than the body's response to the disease.
 The NAT tests for HIV and HCV has been licensed by the U.S.Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These tests detect the genetic material of a transfusion-transmitted virus like HIV without waiting for the body to form antibodies, potentially offering an important time advantage over current techniques.
 Leukocytes (white blood cells) help fight off foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses, and abnormal cells. In fact, these foreign leukocytes in transfused red blood cells and platelets are often not well tolerated and have been associated with some types of transfusion complications. Leukocytes in stored blood products can have a variety of biological effects, including depression of immune function, which can result in organ failure and death.[28] Because whole blood is rarely used for transfusion and not kept in routine inventory, leukoreduced red blood supplies are critical. After collection, the whole blood is separated into red cells and plasma by centrifugation. A preservative solution is mixed with the red cells and the component is filtered with a leukoreduction filter. The shelf life of this product is 42 days.
 ARC is moving toward system-wide universal prestorage leukocyte reduction to improve patient care. From 1976 through 1985, the FDA received reports of 355 fatalities associated with transfusion, 99 of which were excluded from further review because they were unrelated to transfusion or involved hepatitis or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.[29] While the FDA has not yet made leukoreduction a requirement, ARC took a leading role in implementing this procedure with a goal of leukoreducing all blood products. More than 70 percent of ARC red blood cell components undergo prestorage leukoreduction, a filtering process that is done soon after blood is donated.
 ARC operates the Jerome H. Holland blood laboratory in Rockville, Maryland. Each year,[when?] the Red Cross invests more than $25 million in research activities at the Holland Laboratory and in the field.
 ARC offers cellular therapies; this treatment involves collecting and treating blood cells from a patient or other blood donor. The treated cells are then introduced into a patient to help revive normal cell function, replace cells that are lost as a result of disease, accidents or aging, or to prevent illnesses from appearing.
 Training Services is one of the five divisions of the American Red Cross, responsible for providing health and safety training to the general public as well as the workforce. In fiscal year 2017 the American Red Cross trained 2.28 million people how to save lives through their First Aid, CPR or AED courses, water safety and caregiving programs. There are a wide variety of course offerings available:[30]
 In addition to basic level certifications in the above courses the American Red Cross also offers Instructor level courses and Instructor Trainer (IT) level courses. Instructor level courses are designed to teach participants how to become instructors for American Red Cross courses, whereas Instructor Trainer courses (also known as Instructor Trainer Academies) are designed to certify current instructors to become Instructor Trainers, or people who can teach Instructor level courses.
 Training Services has an online store where you can purchase supplies including First Aid Kits, CPR keychains, flashlights, and emergency radios.[31]
 In early 2018 all courses offered by the American Red Cross switched to BigRed mannequins. The investment cost $1.8M and increased participants' understanding of the purpose of compressions during CPR.
 There are three entities that can run American Red Cross courses; The American Red Cross, Authorized Providers, and Licensed Training Providers.[32] The American Red Cross runs many of its own courses that can be conducted on land such as First Aid/CPR/AED and Basic Life Support for Healthcare Providers. There are a number of courses that require aquatic facilities to run, such as Lifeguarding and Water Safety Instructor. These courses are generally left to Authorized Providers (colleges, government agencies, fire departments, community centers) and to Licensed Training Providers (LLC. or Inc.).
 The Scientific Advisory Council is a panel including over 50 medical, scientific, aquatic and academic experts from across the United States.[33]
 Each year, ARC responds to more than 70,000 disasters, including house or apartment fires (making up the majority), hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hazardous materials spills, transportation accidents, explosions and other natural and man-made disasters.
 Although ARC is not a government agency, its authority to provide disaster relief was formalized when, in 1905, it was granted a congressional charter to ""carry on a system of national and international relief in time of peace and apply the same in mitigating the sufferings caused by pestilence, famine, fire, floods, and other great national calamities, and to devise and carry on measures for preventing the same."" The charter is not only a grant of power but also an imposition of duties and obligations to the nation, to disaster victims and to the people who support its work with their donations.
 Disaster relief focuses on emergency disaster-caused needs. When a disaster threatens or strikes, ARC provides shelter, food and health and mental health services (Psychological First Aid) to address basic human needs. The core of Red Cross disaster relief is assistance to individuals and families to enable them to resume their normal daily activities. The organization provides translation and interpretation when necessary, and maintains a database of multilingual volunteers.[34]
 At the local level, ARC chapters operate volunteer-staffed Disaster Action Teams.
 ARC feeds emergency workers of other agencies, handles inquiries from concerned family members outside the disaster area, provides blood and blood products to disaster victims and helps those affected by a disaster to access other resources. It is a member of National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD) and works closely with other agencies such as Salvation Army and Amateur Radio Emergency Service with whom it has memorandums of understanding.
 ARC works to encourage preparedness by providing important literature on readiness. Many chapters also offer free classes to the general public.
 A major misconception among the general public is that ARC provides medical facilities, engages in search and rescue operations or deploys ambulances. Instead, first responder roles are left to government agencies as dictated by the National Response Framework. Red Cross societies outside the U.S. may provide such functions; for example, the Cruz Roja Mexicana (Mexican Red Cross) runs a national ambulance service. Furthermore, American Red Cross Emergency Response Vehicles (ERVs) look similar to ambulances. These ERVs instead are designed for bulk distribution of relief supplies, such as meals, drinks and other relief supplies. Although ARC shelters usually assign a nurse to the facility, they are not equipped to provide medical care beyond first aid.
 The Disaster Services Workforce (DSW) system enrolls volunteers from ARC chapters into a national database of responders, classified by their ability to serve in one or more activities within groups. Services include feeding and sheltering (""mass care"") to warehousing, damage assessment, accounting, communications, public affairs and counseling. Responders complete training requirements specific to the services they want to offer,  backgrounds, and first aid training.
 As a National Response Framework support agency, ARC shelters, feeds and provides other types of emergency relief to victims of disasters. ARC is a co-lead with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the mass care portion of Emergency Support Function 6. ARC and FEMA share responsibility for planning and coordinating mass care services with FEMA. ARC has responsibilities for other Emergency Support Functions, such as providing health and mental health services.[35][36]
 In July 1918 the ARC established a hospital at the entrance of Vladivostok harbor, and during the year 8 more hospitals.  Vladivostok Refugee hospital was opened in early 1919 in former naval barracks and had up to 250 beds.  The ARC provided drugs and medical supplies to Russian hospitals during the civil war.[37]
 Forecasting a major disaster before the landfall of Hurricane Katrina, ARC enlisted 2,000 volunteers to be on a ""stand by"" deployment list.
 According to ARC, during and after hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita, they opened 1,470 shelters and registered 3. 8 million overnight stays. 300,000 Red Cross workers (82% unpaid) provided sheltering, casework, communication and assessment services throughout these events. In addition, 346,980 comfort kits (which contain hygiene essentials such as toothpaste, soap, washcloths and toys for children) and 205,360 cleanup kits (containing brooms, mops and bleach) were distributed. The organization served 68 million snacks and meals. Disaster Health services provided 596,810 contacts, and Disaster Mental Health services 826,590 contacts. Emergency financial assistance was provided to 1.4 million families, including 4 million people. Katrina was the first natural disaster in the United States that ARC utilized their ""Safe and Well"" family location website.[38][39]
 Following the crash of commuter aircraft Comair Flight 5191, the Bluegrass Area Chapter and ARC Critical Response Team (CRT) members were dispatched. This was the worst air disaster in the United States since American Airlines Flight 587. Family and Friends reception centers were established near the arrival and departure airports and in Cincinnati, site of the Comair headquarters. Local chapters in Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky and California provided health and mental health services to family and friends not present in Lexington. Volunteers also staffed the local Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in Lexington, Kentucky.[40]
 In response to the Central Florida Tornado of February 2007, ARC began a large scale disaster relief operation. At least seven shelters were opened. 40,000 pre-packaged meals were sent by ARC, and across the nation, almost 400 Red Cross volunteers were deployed to assist with local relief efforts. The organization deployed more than 30 Emergency Response Vehicles for community food and supply distribution.[41][42]
 ARC immediately responded to the May 2007 Tornado Outbreak in central Kansas by setting up emergency shelters for displaced residents and started the distribution of food, water and relief supplies.[43]
 Following the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge, the Twin Cities Area Chapter responded with their Disaster Action Team to provide food, information and comfort. A family service center was set up, and mental health counselors deployed to numerous locations.[44] Donations contributed for this cause totaled US$138,368 and covered the cost of services[45] but not $65,000 in unexpected expenses.[46] Weather and the collapse placed 70% of Minnesota counties in federal primary or contiguous disaster areas during that August.[47]
 ARC, as part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and its nearly 100 million volunteers, educates and mobilizes communities to overcome life-threatening vulnerabilities. ARC International Services Department focuses on global health, disaster preparedness and response, Restoring Family Links and international humanitarian law dissemination. ARC is involved with international projects such as the measles Initiative, malaria programs in Africa, disaster response and relief efforts in response to the 2004 South Asia tsunami.
 ARC international disaster response and preparedness programs provide relief and development assistance to millions of people annually who suffer as a result of natural and human-made disasters. To respond quickly and effectively, ARC has pre-positioned emergency relief supplies in three warehouses managed by the International Federation in Dubai, Malaysia, and Panama that are used to respond to disasters. An Emergency Response Unit (ERU) is another method with which ARC responds to international emergencies. An ERU is made up of trained personnel and pre-packaged equipment that is crucial in responding to sudden, large-scale disasters and emergencies in remote locations. American Red Cross ERUs specialize in providing emergency relief supplies and IT and Telecommunications for Red Cross response operations.[48]
 On January 12, 2010, a magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake struck the Haitian coast 10 miles from the capital of Port-au-Prince, causing massive damage, more than 200,000 deaths and displacing nearly 2 million people.
 As of March 2011, ARC announced it had allocated $314 million for Haiti earthquake relief and recovery. ARC funded recovery projects to provide transitional homes, health services, disaster preparedness, water and sanitation improvements and livelihoods development. It provided funds for school fees for affected families. As of June 2011, ARC had raised approximately $484 million for Haiti relief and recovery efforts.[49]
 A series of reports by NPR and ProPublica found that much of the money Americans donated never made it to help people in Haiti and promises to rebuild neighborhoods were never met.[50][51]
 ARC International Services global health initiatives focus on preventing and combating infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and measles on a large scale. Through cost-effective, community-based health interventions, ARC targets people in need and focuses on accessibility and equity of care, community participation, and integration with other community development initiatives, such as water and sanitation projects and food and nutrition programs.
 An example of ARC International Services health programming is the Measles Initiative, launched in 2001, as a partnership committed to reducing measles deaths globally. The initiative provides technical and financial support to governments and communities on vaccination campaigns and disease surveillance worldwide. Leading these efforts are ARC, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF and the World Health Organization. The Measles Initiative has supported vaccination campaigns in more than 60 countries, mostly in Africa and Asia. Since 2001, the initiative has helped vaccinate one billion children in more than 60 developing countries.[52] The initiative supported the distribution of more than 37 million insecticide-treated mosquito nets for malaria prevention, 81 million doses of de-worming medicine, 95 million doses of polio vaccine, and 186 million doses of Vitamin A.
 In December 2006, ARC became a founding partner of the Malaria No More campaign. The campaign was formed by leading non-governmental organizations to inspire individuals, institutions, and organizations in the private sector to support a comprehensive approach to end malaria, a devastating but preventable disease. ARC supported local Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers in Africa who educated families and communities about malaria prevention and treatment, such as the proper and consistent use of insecticide-treated bed nets. ARC provided technical assistance and capacity-building support to its partners in difficult-to-reach communities.
 ARC handles international tracing requests and searches for families who have been separated. This service attempts to re-establish contact between separated family members. Restoring Family Links services provide the exchange of hand-written Red Cross Messages between individuals and their relatives who may be refugees or prisoners of war. At any given time, ARC Restoring Family Links program is handling the aftermath of 20–30 wars and conflicts. The worldwide structure of Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross make this service possible. When new information from former Soviet Union archives became available in the 1990s, a special unit was created to handle World War II and Holocaust tracing services.
 ARC International Services educates the American public about the guiding principles of international humanitarian law (IHL) for conduct in warfare as set forth by the Geneva Conventions of 1949. In doing so, ARC International Services provides support to ARC chapters in their IHL dissemination efforts, offering courses and providing instructor training.
 ARC provides emergency and non-emergency services to the United States military. The most notable service is emergency family communications, where families can contact the Red Cross to send important family messages (such as a death in the family, or new birth). ARC can also act as a verifying agency.[53] The agency operates call centers to provide these services.[54] ARC works closely with other military societies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, to provide other services to service members and their families. ARC is not involved with prisoners of war; these are monitored by the International Committee of the Red Cross, an international body.
 One criticism of Red Cross services to the military stems from stories about ARC charging troops during the Second World War and Korean War token fees for ""comfort items"" such as toothpaste, coffee, donuts, and cigarettes and for off-base food and lodging. The fee suggestion had been made in a letter dated March 1942 from the Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to Norman H. Davis, the chairman of ARC. The suggestion was that Allied soldiers were being charged money so Americans should be charged too so as to ""ensure an equitable distribution among all service personnel of Red Cross resources"".[55] The Red Cross adopted the Secretary's suggestion as policy.[56]
 
During World War II, ARC operated the American Red Cross Clubmobile Service to provide servicemen with food, entertainment and ""a connection home."" In a June 18, 1945, address to Congress, General Dwight D. Eisenhower said of the Red Cross service in World War II, ""The Red Cross, with its clubs for recreation, its coffee and doughnuts in the forward areas, its readiness to meet the needs of the well and to help minister to the wounded has often seemed the friendly hand of this nation, reaching across the sea to sustain its fighting men.""[57] An account of one World War II American Red Cross Girl is recorded in Destination Unknown by Kathleen Cox; her mother, LeOna Cox, was recruited to Red Cross Service by a fellow teacher at Allegheny College.[58] Another account of an American Red Cross World War II worker is related in letters by Evelyn Merritt Welden, compiled in the book How to Play During a War: A Free Spirit's Life in Letters, by her son, Lynne Whelden. During the Vietnam War 627 American women served in the ARC Supplemental Recreation Overseas Program. At the invitation of the United States Army the ""Donut Dollies"" provided morale-boosting games to soldiers. Due to the mobility of the UH-1 Iroquois, Vietnam Donut Dollies were able to visit troops in forwarding operating positions. The 2008 documentary film A Touch of Home: The Vietnam War's Red Cross Girls tells the story of these women. ARC also provided services to entertain wounded soldiers at the Great Lakes Naval Hospital during the Vietnam War.
 In 2011, the Service to the Armed Forces (SAF) unit was reorganized and began receiving $24 million per year from Congress for operating expenses. Along with being downsized there was a consolidation into four regional locations (San Diego, CA, Ft. Sill, OK, Louisville, KY, and Springfield, MA). In 2012 the first stories began breaking about long call times and the poor quality of response from call takers.[59][60] along with questions about whether money was being used appropriately.[61] In 2015, the San Diego and Springfield locations were closed because an online option for families was implemented.[62]
 On August 7, 2007,[63] Johnson & Johnson (J&J) filed suit against ARC over its sublicensing of the Red Cross image for the production of first aid kits and similar products, which it alleged competed with the company's products. The suit also asked for the destruction of all non-Johnson & Johnson Red Cross Emblem bearing products and demanded that ARC pay punitive damages and J&J's legal fees.
 The Red Cross' position was that it had licensed its name to first aid kit makers in an effort to encourage readiness for disasters and that license revenues supported humanitarian work.[64] J&J claimed that the Red Cross's commercial ventures were outside the scope of historically well-agreed usage and were in direct violation of federal statutes.[65]
 On May 14, 2008, a federal judge ruled against J&J.[66] In June 2008, the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached allowing both parties to use the symbol.[67]
 The FDA took court action against ARC in response to deficiencies in their procedures for ensuring blood supply safety. The resulting consent decree outlines violations of federal law that ARC engaged in before 1993.[68] ARC paid millions of dollars in fines.
 ARC Biomedical Services instituted a standardized computer system to maintain the blood donor database; five National Testing Laboratories (NTLs) that test some six million units of blood annually;[69] the Charles Drew Biomedical Institute, which provides training and other educational resources to Red Cross Blood Services' personnel; a Quality Assurance/Regulatory Affairs Department, which helps to ensure regulatory compliance; and, a centrally managed blood inventory system.
 The Consent Decree was amended in 2003 with penalties for specific violations.
 The FDA could impose penalties after April 2003 up to the following maximum amounts:
 The FDA continued to apply pressure and fines to ARC in order to enforce compliance with regulations, including a $1.7 million fine in June 2008.[70]
 ARC worked closely with the FDA to develop a more robust system. The systems resulted in a five-year period of sustained compliance that led to the release from the Consent Decree as of December 4, 2015.[71]
 ARC faced criticism from lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) advocacy organizations for prohibiting men who have sex with men (MSM) from donating blood. This policy was an FDA requirement for all blood collection companies and organizations in the United States. Specifically, the FDA instructs blood collection organizations to ""defer for 12 months from the most recent sexual contact, a man who has had sex with another man during the past 12 months"".[72] Consequently, ARC was legally unable to collect blood from such men. In 2006, along with the AABB and America's Blood Centers, ARC petitioned the FDA to remove the requirement from blood donations, citing better screening technologies.[73][74]  As of December 2016, the American Red Cross reports on its website that its deferral of MSM from donating blood for 12 months after any sexual contact with another man is aligned with the guidance issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[75]
 In March 2006, investigations of allegations of fraud and theft by volunteers and contractors within ARC Katrina operations were launched by the Louisiana Attorney-General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).[76] In response, ARC increased its internal and external education of the organization's fraud and a waste hotline for confidential reporting to a third party agency.[citation needed] The organization also elected to implement a background check policy for all volunteers and staff, starting in 2006.[77]
 In April 2006, an unnamed former ARC official leaked reports made by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the British Red Cross. Such reports are typical of a large-scale disaster relief operation involving other national Red Cross societies to solicit their input, but are usually confidential and not released to the general public. These particular reports were particularly critical of ARC operations in Katrina-affected regions, although the British Red Cross report strongly praised ARC volunteers for their efforts.[citation needed]
 In October 2014, independent public interest news broadcasters NPR and ProPublica published investigative reports on the Red Cross's handling of US East Coast Hurricanes Sandy and Isaac, citing internal Red Cross documents and interviews with former Red Cross and government officials. It criticized the organization's response in failing to meet the immediate needs of victims. It also described ""an organization so consumed with public relations that it hindered the charity's ability to provide disaster services.""[78][79][80]

Amici del Mondo World Friends Onlus	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amici_del_Mondo_World_Friends_Onlus	"Amici del Mondo World Friends Onlus is an independent Italian non-profit association of social utility[1] for international cooperationWorld Friends is a Non-Governmental Organization recognized by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Law no. 125 of 2014 updated to July 16, 2016, registered in the register of ONLUS and the Register of Legal Persons D.P.R. 361. Recognized by the Government of Kenya as a Non-governmental organization (NGO),[2] in 2011 obtained the same accreditation at the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Established in 2001, the association has its head offices in Rome and has volunteer-based regional offices in Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, Sicily. The association’s African office is based in Nairobi.
 The aim of World Friends is to contribute to the achievement of the principles established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in all parts of the world, giving priority to fundamental rights for health, housing and education. World Friends’ actions at present are focused on the African continent and  their final goal is to improve health, social and educational conditions in the most disadvantaged populations. Every action taken responds to actual needs and to a specific request from the local communities, and is undertaken with their full collaboration.
 For this reason, the World Friends’ operative centre has taken the decision to live and work in the city of Nairobi in Kenya so as to assimilate better into the social structure of the area and be able to act as spokesman for the local communities.
 World Friends began from an initiative of Gianfranco Morino, a medical doctor with more than 35 years’ experience in Africa. After having collaborated for a number of years on projects  with the Italian Cooperation for Development, in 1991 he took on responsibility with the Programme for Health Prevention and Education in the nomadic area of Sololo, North Kenya, collaborating with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Following work with the European Union in Somalia, in 1994 he began to work in health prevention and education in the shanty towns of Korogocho and Mathare in Nairobi. In 2002 he then took over the direction of the Department of Surgery at Mbagathi Hospital, still in the Kenyan capital, being the only European to work in a state-run hospital.
 In 2001, together with a group of friends and collaborators, all convinced of the need for an association to be created in Africa itself, Morino established ""World Friends - Amici del mondo"". The central idea was that of an organization that could properly integrate with the reality of the local population, not being thousands of miles away, and able to carry out projects deriving from the concrete needs of these populations. To respond to that need, World Friends has over the years prioritized the use of local personnel, relying minimally on the services of expatriate personnel.
 The objective of all World Friends projects is to promote health, education and social development of the most disadvantaged populations in the south of the world. World Friends is active in Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia, meeting the needs of the local populations and with their full involvement. The ultimate goal remains to encourage self-sufficiency in the communities where the Association works, and it is for this reason that World Friends makes use above all of local personnel for its activities in Africa, contributing to their professional training.[3]
 An example of World Friends approach is the construction of the Ruaraka Uhai Neema Hospital, a multi-functioning health centre opened by World Friends in November 2008 Inauguration of R.U. Neema Hospital. Situated near to the shanty towns of Nairobi the hospital treats more than 10,000 patients per month, thanks to a staff composed of 99% local personnel. The Ruaraka Uhai Neema Hospital dedicated not only to the treatment of the poorest sector of the population but also to the training of local medical personnel. This action will go on further to consolidate the work carried out by World Friends at the Mbagathi Hospital and at the surgeries located in the Nairobi shanty towns. In addition to health assistance, World Friends workers carry out action in the field of health prevention and education, above all to combat the spread of the HIV virus.
Services offered by the hospital: General clinic and Maternal-Infant Clinic with vaccination services, gynecology and pediatrics; Maternity Department with operating theatre; Diagnostics Centre offering laboratory tests, radiography and echography. Accident & Emergency, minor surgery and day hospital; HIV tests and treatments; Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy; Pharmacy; Ambulance service; Centre for Professional Training; Pediatrics Department.
 Since its inception in 2001, the association has focused its plan of action on achieving the eight Millennium Development Goals, approved by the 193 member States of the United Nations for world development, to be achieved within 2015. Today, the new challenge are the Sustainable Development Goals to which all countries are called upon to contribute to bringing the world to a global, economic and social sustainability path without distinction Between South and North.
Our new goal is therefore the 2030: World Friends will not only continue to work against poverty in the South of the planet, expanding its collaboration with other communities in Africa and Latin America, but will also bring programs and experience in the suburbs of the North of the World, where injustice, inequality and the lack of rights are increasingly accentuated.
 World Friends works mainly in the sub-saharian countries of Africa, such as Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia.
The projects of World Friends are mainly focused on populations in the shantytowns in the north - east area of Nairobi (Korogocho, Kariobangi, Babadogo,  Mathare Valley - Eastleigh, Huruma, Kahawa, Soweto).around 700,000 people, half of whom are under 15 years of age.
 The beneficiaries of World Friends’ projects come from backgrounds marked by poverty, violence, criminality, prostitution, the precariousness of housing and work, pollution, diseases. The health problems found by the health workers of World Friends are innumerable: gastroenteritis and severe respiratory diseases, especially in children; a permanent status of malnutrition and the presence of typhoid fever and malaria. Tuberculosis is in evident recrudescence; the number of children with physical handicaps is high. The diagnosis of ailments requiring surgery and the incidence of cancer – the latter showing a clear increase – is often delayed due to the intrinsic inefficiencies of the health systems in African countries. The lack of specialist services for diagnosis and treatment accessible to the poor worsens the outcomes of traumas and burns, very frequent among children, often causing permanent disabilities in a context where physical integrity is linked to the survival of the individual. The transmission of sexual diseases is very widespread, AIDS in particular being a very real scourge.
 Regarding trends for the rest of the city and for the country, access to reproductive health services in the Nairobi slums is minimal: only 15% of the health structures present provide basic obstetrical assistance and only 35% of the births are assisted by qualified personnel. Maternal mortality in the shanty towns (590 mothers per 100,000 births in 1998)[4] is higher than in any other region in Kenya. The infant mortality rate under 5 years of age (1,565 deaths for every 1000 babies, equal to 15.6%)[5] is higher than that of any other urban settlement in Kenya. Lastly, because the incidence off AIDS is decreasing at the National level, in the Nairobi slums adolescents and women are still strongly vulnerable, with 37% of women between 20 and 24 years of age resulting positive to the infection.[4]
 World Friends works in collaboration with many other bodies in Italian and international cooperation: CONCORD Italia Platform, Italian Observatory for Global Action against AIDS, Global Health Center of the Tuscany Region, 
Since 2016 World Friends is a member of LINK 2007, one of the three main networks representing NGOs nationwide.
World Friends is part of regional networks that unite profit and non-profit realities, public bodies, universities and experts, thanks to the activities of local offices and volunteers. These realities work to systemize and strengthen local activities of international cooperation, the development of territorial cooperation and awareness raising in Italy. The most active are the Tuscan Forum for International Activities, the Coordination of Piedmont NGOs, the Janua Forum, the Ligurian Network for the Promotion of International Activities.
Nairobi's headquarters and association projects are constantly a place to visit by delegations from various organizations and by volunteers, interns and practitioners. World Friends is a member of several networks including: Hennet - Health NGOs Network, a NGO consortium and Kenyan and international institutions operating in Kenya in the field of healthcare; Action for Children with Disabilities (ACD), Nairobi Child Protection Network (NCPT), Elimu Yetu, Kasarani Genver-Based Violence Forum.
 In addition to the realities involved in the projects at local level in Italy and in Africa, World Friends’ main partners are the following:"
Amref Health Africa	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amref_Health_Africa	"Amref Health Africa (formerly the African Medical and Research Foundation – AMREF) was founded in 1957 by three surgeons as the Flying Doctors of East Africa.[1] Three doctors – Sir Michael Wood, Sir Archibald McIndoe and Tom Rees – drew up a plan to provide medical care in East Africa, where they had all worked for many years as reconstructive surgeons.
 Amref Health Africa was founded in 1957 as a mobile air-based service. Land-based services and mobile clinics were added in the early 1960s. Training for local health care providers was gradually added. This included the development of health learning materials and a focus on community-based health care. 
 During the 1980s, Amref Health Africa moved into community health development, closer collaboration with the ministries of health in the region, and cooperation with international aid agencies. This set the organisation’s course for the 1980s and beyond. Greater emphasis was given to strengthening health systems and staff development. 
 In the early 1990s, Amref Health Africa introduced a one-year community health training programme. The 1990s also saw Amref Health Africa’s work expand to focus on preventative measures against malaria, HIV/AIDS, and TB. During the mid-1990s, Amref Health Africa increased its focus on HIV/AIDS as it looked set to undo much of the progress made in health during the 20th century, and become a major burden to health systems in poor countries. 
 In March 2018, Amref Health Africa and GE Healthcare became partners for improving primary and referral care on reducing preventable maternal and infant mortality.[2]"
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_W._Mellon_Foundation	"The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation of New York City in the United States is a private foundation with five core areas of interest, and endowed with wealth accumulated by  Andrew W. Mellon of the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is the product of the 1969 merger of the Avalon Foundation and the Old Dominion Foundation. These foundations were set up separately by Paul Mellon and Ailsa Mellon Bruce, the children of Andrew W. Mellon. It is housed in the expanded former offices of the Bollingen Foundation in New York City, another educational philanthropy supported by Paul Mellon. Elizabeth Alexander is the Foundation's president. Her predecessors have included Earl Lewis, Don Randel, William G. Bowen, John Edward Sawyer, and Nathan Pusey. In 2004, the Foundation was awarded the National Medal of Arts.[2]
 Mellon has a small research group that has investigated doctoral education, collegiate admissions, independent research libraries, charitable nonprofits, scholarly communications, and other issues in order to ensure that the foundation's grants would be well-informed and more effective. Some of the recent publications of this effect include Equity and Excellence in American Higher Education, Reclaiming the Game: College Sports and Educational Values, JSTOR: A History, The Game of Life: College Sports and Educational Values, and The Shape of the River.
 Mellon's endowment has fluctuated in the range of $5–6 billion in recent years, and its annual grantmaking has been on the order of $300 million."

Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos_Disease_Awareness_Organization	"The Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization (ADAO) is the largest independent nonprofit in the U.S. dedicated to preventing asbestos exposure, eliminating asbestos-related diseases such as mesothelioma, and protecting asbestos victims' civil rights through education, advocacy and community initiatives.[1]
(ADAO) was founded by Linda Reinstein and Doug Larkin in 2004 and is headquartered in Redondo Beach, California. It is led by three boards (Board of Directors, Science Advisory Board, and Prevention Advisory Board), as well as a nationwide State Leadership Team made up of asbestos victims and advocates. Linda Reinstein, ADAO President and Co-Founder, has been invited to and presented at legislative hearings and medical symposiums in more than 20 countries including being invited to testify before the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.[2]
 In addition to the conference, ADAO annually hosts the ""Global Asbestos Awareness Week"" from April 1–7. Since 2005, the U.S. Senate has unanimously passed National Asbestos Awareness Resolutions.
 Embracing traditional and new media, ADAO's strategic storytelling has served as model for non-state actor communications.
 ADAO has produced PSAs to increase awareness, prevent exposure, and shape policy. The USA is the only western industrialized nation not to ban asbestos.[3][4]"
The Asia Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asia_Foundation	"The Asia Foundation is a nonprofit international development organization committed to ""improving lives across a dynamic and developing Asia.""[2] Informed by six decades of experience and deep local expertise, its programs address critical issues affecting Asia in the 21st century—governance and law, economic development, women's empowerment, environment, and regional cooperation. Headquartered in San Francisco, The Asia Foundation works through a network of 18 offices in 18 Asian countries and in Washington, DC.
 The ""Committee For Free Asia"" was founded in 1951 as a CIA operation.[3] Its name was changed to ""The Asia Foundation"" in 1954.[4] The Foundation marked its 60 years of experience in Asia working with private and public partners in the areas of leadership and institutional development, exchanges, and policy research.[5] Starting January 1, 2011, David D. Arnold serves as president of the Foundation.[6] The Foundation is governed by an eminent and well-known group of private sector trustees.
 The Asia Foundation works with local leaders and communities to build effective institutions and advance reforms. Across Asia, the nonprofit organization is improving lives and expanding opportunities by:
 The Asia Foundation addresses issues on both a country and regional level through a network of 18 offices around the world.[14] In cooperation with local partners in government and civil society, the Foundation's international and local staff provide insight and program on a variety of development challenges. Besides its headquarters in San Francisco and an office in Washington, D.C., it has a presence in the following Asian nations:
 The Asia Foundation's largest program area – governance and law – develops and supports initiatives that build more effective and responsive governance in Asia. The Foundation cooperates with a broad network of partners in government, civil society, and the private sector to improve governing institutions in order to help accelerate economic and social change, reduce corruption, manage conflict, and increase citizen participation.
 Its sub-programming areas include:
 While women in Asia have made steady gains in recent years, gender inequality remains a significant problem. For 60 years, The Asia Foundation has supported women and girls across the Asia-Pacific region. Its Women's Empowerment Program was established in 1994 and has transformed the lives of thousands of women and girls through significant programs that focus on three key areas: expanding women's economic opportunities, increasing women's personal rights and security, and advancing women's political participation. The Foundation supports an integrated and coordinated approach that integrates gender into its work in governance, economic development, regional cooperation, and the environment.[15]
 Development and aid effectiveness is a way through which the Asia Foundation brings together both their long standing and emerging donors and experts of development to have an exchange of ideas on how to best resolve key challenges in development; examples of this include the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid and Effectiveness and Asian Approaches to Development Cooperation. In these seminars and forums the Asia Foundation successful creates an open dialogue among the participants resulting in collaborative and cooperative approach to dealing with issues of development in Asia. A crucial element of this program is that it is brings together government official, policy makers, philanthropists all to one table—an approach missing from most NGOs who operate solely on implementing programs that their organizations initiate and support. Nina Merchant describes the role of Rigorous Impact analysis in the Foundations
 The Asia Foundation has a decades-long history of supporting broad-based economic growth across Asia through both public and private channels. The Foundation's Economic Development programs support Asian initiatives to enhance economic governance to accelerate and sustain inclusive economic growth and broaden economic opportunities through design and implementation in three core program areas: 1) improving the business environment for private sector growth, 2) advancing regional economic cooperation, and 3) supporting entrepreneurship development.
 The Foundation works with local partners to design and implement program activities focusing on promoting investment and private enterprises, inclusive and equitable growth, empowering entrepreneurs and fostering intra and inter-regional trade by removing non-tariff barriers and strengthening domestic demand. From the sub-national level to regionally across borders, the Foundation is building coalitions for change that result in better business environments, job creation, and lasting change for individuals, families and communities.
 Economic Development Impacts:
 Since 1954, Books for Asia has donated more than 40 million books to libraries in dozens of Asian countries, impacting the lives of millions of Asians. In 2006 alone, Books for Asia donated 920,000 books and educational materials valued at $30 million to schools and educational institutions in 15 countries. Books for Asia's donations help inspire Asia's students, citizens, and future leaders by enhancing English-language capacity, sharpening vocational and research skills, improving their knowledge about America, and giving the gift of enhanced literacy to children. The Asia Foundation's experienced local staff throughout Asia allows the Books for Asia program to work with librarians and educators to identify needs and appropriate materials, and to distribute requested books quickly and efficiently.
 In 2005, Books for Asia's donations had a special focus on communities affected by the Asian tsunami in December 2004. Donations from publisher Scholastic, Inc., and a timely endorsement by the Association of American Publishers, helped Books for Asia respond to the urgent need for books in schools and libraries in Sri Lanka and Thailand that were devastated by the disaster. As these communities rebuild, Books for Asia will continue to provide access to children's books, with a total of more than 300,000 reaching affected schools by the end of 2006.
 ""Books for Asia"" is one of the many initiatives that have been put forth by TAF. Under this program, one million brand-new books are put into the hands of students, educators, and local and national leaders in 18 countries annually. The Asia Foundation recognizes that books change lives and help shape young people's imaginations, critical thinking skills, and their understanding of the world. Therefore, they are recognized as powerful tools to combat poverty and inspire positive, long-lasting change.
 The main objective of the program is to provide access to information through reading materials, and cultivating a culture of reading and literature and linking people together in today's world. Under TAF, resources are made available for the people in Timor-Leste to enhance their mastery of English language; sharpen vocational and research skills, build knowledge in the business, legal and sciences professions. This enables people in Timor-Leste, regardless of their age, to equip themselves with more knowledge and skills through reading. This project also seeks to infuse children with an early love for reading, which is critical to increasing literacy rates.
 Since TAF's founding in 1954, 45 million books, software programs and other educational materials have been donated to tens of thousands of learning institutions. Each year, the Asia Foundation in Timor-Leste receives brand new, high quality books donated by prominent publishers in the U.S. These books are catalogued and distributed to the recipients in Timor-Leste based on requests as well as through book drives.
 The Mobile Library Program also consistently extends the Books for Asia program and its outreach to a bigger community in Timor-Leste. Extensions of the program are achieved through routine visits to schools, libraries and universities in Timor-Leste. These materials will eventually improve the quality of educational institutions currently available in Timor-Leste. 
Apart from the Books for Asia program, the Foundation also supports initiatives that spur literacy, promote understanding of democratic principles and strengthen civic participation. For example, the Foundation supported events jointly organized by Alieu Training and Resource Center (A resource center in the rural area of Timor-Leste) and the Ministry of Education that encourages children to continue schooling by recognizing the children's accomplishments in their education. In 2007, the resource center conducted a speech contest for school children in the Aileu District; and in 2008 and 2009, reading contests for school children was held for the children in Aileu District
 Today, the Asia Foundation's Books for Asia program in Timor-Leste has distributed 9,942 books to more than 40 public, school, university and local NGO libraries as well as government agencies. More than 3,000 of the books are allocated toward book fairs to help increase awareness about the important role of reading.
 Through its Asian American Exchange unit, The Asia Foundation seeks to encourage greater understanding between Asians and Americans with the ultimate aim of contributing toward strengthened U.S.-Asia relations. For over six decades, Foundation grants have provided thousands of participants with opportunities to exchange views, professional perspectives, and gain direct experience with regions other than their own through high-quality tailored fellowships, study tours, workshops, and other programs. Notable programs include:
 The Asia Foundation's Environment program supports Asian initiatives to ensure the sustainability of the environment and natural resources critical to Asia's development and future well-being. The Foundation works with a broad range of local stakeholders including civil society, government, and the private sector to strengthen the institutions and processes through which environmental resources are managed, and to improve environmental policy.  Areas where the Foundation is having an impact in Asia include: advancing responsible mining and natural resource management in Mongolia; increasing public participation and transparency in environmental decision-making in China; and preparing for natural disasters and climate change in the Pacific Islands, among others.
 The Asia Foundation's Regional Cooperation program works to strengthen relations among Asian nations and their peoples in the effort to foster peace, stability, prosperity, and effective governance. Its focus includes fostering regional cooperation on critical issues in Southeast, Northeast, and South Asia; foreign policy capacity-building in select countries in developing Asia; providing life-changing opportunities for emerging leaders in the region; and facilitating policy dialogues on Asian affairs and U.S.-Asian relations in Washington.[17]
 ""The Asia Foundation (TAF), a Central Intelligence Agency proprietary, was established in 1954 to undertake cultural and educational activities on behalf of the United States Government in ways not open to official U.S. agencies.""[18]
 The Asia Foundation is an outgrowth of the Committee for a Free Asia, which was founded by the U.S. government in 1951.[19] CIA funding and support of the Committee for a Free Asia and the Asia Foundation were assigned the CIA code name ""Project DTPILLAR"".[20]
 In 1954, the Committee for a Free Asia was renamed the Asia Foundation (TAF) and incorporated in California[21] as a private, nominally non-governmental organization devoted to promoting democracy, rule of law, and market-based development in post-war Asia.
 Among the original founding officers of the board, there were several presidents/chairmen of large companies including T.S. Peterson, CEO of Standard Oil of California (now Chevron), Brayton Wilbur, president of Wilbur-Ellis Co., and J.D. Zellerbach, chairman of the Crown Zellerbach Corporation; four university presidents including Grayson Kirk from Columbia, J.E. Wallace Sterling of Stanford, and Raymond Allen from UCLA; prominent attorneys including Turner McBaine and A. Crawford Greene; Pulitzer Prize-winning writer James Michener; Paul Hoffman, the first administrator of the Marshall Plan in Europe; and several major figures in foreign affairs.
 In 1966, Ramparts revealed that the CIA was covertly funding a number of organizations, including the Asia Foundation.[18] A commission authorized by President Johnson and led by Secretary of State Rusk determined that the Asia Foundation should be preserved and overtly funded by the US government. Following this change, the US government described the Asia Foundation as a ""quasi-nongovernmental organizations"" and said that ""the core of its budget"" was still provided by the US government.[22] The Foundation began to restructure its programming, shifting away from its earlier goals of ""building democratic institutions and encouraging the development of democratic leadership"" toward an emphasis on Asian development as a whole (CRS 1983).
 In 2006, the Asia Foundation provided more than $53 million in program support and distributed 920,000 books and educational materials valued at $30 million throughout Asia."
Association L'APPEL	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_L%27APPEL	"L'APPEL is a non-profit humanitarian organization supporting needy children around the globe. It was founded in 1968 by a group of French doctors specialized in pediatrics to help children in Vietnam suffering from the war. For over 40 years l'Appel has led humanitarian projects around the world, developing schools and hospitals in countries in need with the help of locals. Its headquarters are in Paris, France, but the association has offices throughout the country.

Over 85% of its budget goes to the funding of its numerous programs. L'Appel is also working on projects with UNHCR. 
 The association operates in 9 countries of Asia, Africa, Latin America (Vietnam, El Salvador, Haiti, Madagascar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Peru, Rwanda, Burkina Faso) helping children, who suffer from diseases and natural disasters. The association has  intervened in over 18 countries, including Algeria, Cameroun, Poland and Armenia."
Association of Gospel Rescue Missions	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Gospel_Rescue_Missions	"The Association of Gospel Rescue Missions (AGRM), formerly known as the International Union of Gospel Missions, is a  nonprofit organization in the United States, founded in 1913. AGRM's member missions work to provide emergency shelter, permanent housing, food, youth and family services, and education and job training programs. In addition, AGRM member organizations operate rehabilitation programs for drug addicts and alcoholics, and provide assistance to the elderly poor and at-risk youth. If annual cash contributions to all member missions were combined, the Association would be among the ten largest nonprofit organizations in the United States. Each year, AGRM's network of some 300 rescue missions serve approximately 66 million meals, provide more than 20 million nights of shelter and housing, assist some 45,000 people in finding employment, provide clothing to more than 750,000 people, and graduate nearly 17,000 homeless men and women from addiction recovery programs into productive living.
 Rescue missions have been providing hospitality to impoverished people in America since the 1870s. Rescue mission staff members provide effective care for men, women, and children who are hungry, homeless, abused, or addicted.
 AGRM is North America’s oldest and largest network of crisis shelters and rehabilitation centers.
 Jerry and Maria McAuley founded a rescue mission in October 1872, which became a precursor of a ministry that was to spread around the world. The rescue mission would become the New York City Rescue Mission. Mission leaders saw a need for an organization that would foster “fellowship, cooperation with all engaged or interested in gospel missions, and other rescue work throughout the United States and in other lands, in the mutual advancement of the cause of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
 The International Union of Gospel Missions (later called AGRM) was organized on September 17, 1913, in New York City. Mr. Sidney Whittemore is credited as the father of the body. The State of New York granted the rescue ministry leaders a certificate of incorporation on October 14, 1913.
 As the IUGM grew, it devised a system of convenience for closer and more concentrated work among its members by establishing local branches known as districts. Today there are nine districts, each of which has elected officers.[1]
 As part of its mission, AGRM takes four major responsibilities: (1) Creating new rescue mission ministries; (2) promoting and emphasizing prayer and spiritual values and growth; (3) providing local ministries with education, training, consultation, conferences, conventions, and networking; and (4) stressing to the church and community the importance and value of their rescue efforts.
 The Association of Gospel Rescue Missions is responsible for aiding missions of homeless people and others in need every year. In 2010 alone, the association graduated more than 18,000 homeless men and women from its programs into productive living, distributed more than 24 million pieces of clothing, and provided some 210,000 families with 735,000 items of furniture–along with offering millions of meals and nights of lodging.[citation needed] AGRM welcomes both individual and organizational memberships.[2]"
Atlantic Philanthropies	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Philanthropies	"The Atlantic Philanthropies (AP) is a private foundation created in 1982 by Irish-American businessman Chuck Feeney. The Atlantic Philanthropies focuses its giving on health, social, and politically liberal public policy causes in Australia, Bermuda, Ireland, South Africa, the United States and Vietnam.[3] It is among the largest foreign charitable donors in each of the countries in which it operates,[4] and is the single largest funder of programs that encourage the civic engagement of older people and of comprehensive immigration reform in the United States.[5][6] With the single largest advocacy grant ever made by a foundation, the Atlantic Philanthropies committed $27 million to win passage of the Affordable Care Act in the United States. About half of the Atlantic Philanthropies' grants have been made in donations that allow lobbying.[3]
 The Atlantic Philanthropies commenced a spend-down process in 2012, and its entire portfolio will be liquid by the end of 2016. It plans to fully shutter its doors in 2020.[2][7]
 Irish-American businessman Chuck Feeney established the Atlantic Philanthropies in Bermuda in 1982.[8] The organization made its first grant of $7 million that same year to Cornell University.[9]
 Feeney, who co-founded Duty Free Shoppers (DFS), transferred all of his assets and his entire 38.75% ownership stake in DFS to what became the Atlantic Philanthropies in 1984.[8] For the first fifteen years of Atlantic's existence, donations were made anonymously, and organizations receiving grants were required to sign contracts agreeing to not reveal the source of their donations.[10][8]
 Atlantic's charitable giving remained anonymous until 1997, when a business dispute Feeney was involved in forced him to disclose the funding for Atlantic.[11]
 Since its founding in 1982, the Atlantic Philanthropies has given out about $7.5 billion. The Atlantic Philanthropies is a limited-life foundation which will close its doors in 2020.[12]
 The President and CEO of the Atlantic Philanthropies is Christopher Oechsli.[13] He was appointed in 2011, succeeding Gara LaMarche. Martin O'Brien was appointed Senior Vice President of Programmes shortly thereafter.
 AP concentrates its donations in the areas of aging, children and youth, population and health, and reconciliation and human rights.[14] As of 2013, the Atlantic Philanthropies had distributed $6.5 billion.[15]
 In Australia, AP has donated more than $AUD500 million, including $AUD250 million in Queensland. These donations have been directed toward the building or expansion of 20 research facilities in Australia.[16]
 In Northern Ireland, AP has controversially supported the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in its work to develop and promote proposals for a Bill of Rights for the region. It has also funded a coalition of civil society groups, the Bill of Rights Consortium.[17]
 AP has invested over $1 billion in third-level education on the island of Ireland, funding research facilities at the University of Limerick and Dublin City University as well as a library and sports facility at Trinity College Dublin.[18] AP's grants in Ireland have been credited by some for stimulating the Irish economy in the 1990s.[19]
 In 2009, AP indicated that it would grant €80 million in Ireland in 2009 to children, elderly and human rights projects.[20] In 2011, AP awarded a €1.2 million grant to Barnardo's, one of Ireland's best-known children's charities.[21]
 In 2004–13, AP provided $11.5m and political advice to the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network and three other Irish gay-rights groups.[22][23][24] Prior to the 2015 same-sex marriage referendum, Catholic commentator Breda O'Brien characterised this as ""American money buy[ing] an Irish referendum"".[24]
 As of 2014, a total of $226 million in Atlantic grants have leveraged $1.3 billion of government money to the Irish university system.[25]
 In March 2009, AP pledged $125 million to the University of California, San Francisco to fund a medical center at the Mission Bay campus. At the time, it was the single largest grant the Atlantic Philanthropies had given.[26] The project broke ground in October 2010.[27]
 From 2008-10, AP donated $27 million to Health Care for America Now (HCAN) to support their efforts to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[28] It was the single largest advocacy grant ever made by a foundation.[29]
 In 2011, AP gave $350 million to Cornell University to help build Cornell Tech, a new graduate school campus on New York City's Roosevelt Island. At the time, the gift was the largest donation in the university's history.[30]
 In 2014, the Atlantic Philanthropies announced that it was making a series of major culminating grants, including one to foster peace and human rights in Northern Ireland, another to help fund a national dementia strategy in Ireland, and a third to expand the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington, D.C.-based liberal think tank.[31]
 Recipients of 2016 culminating grants include the London School of Economics, for support of the International Inequalities Institute, and the Rhodes Trust, to fund the newly established Atlantic Institute.[32]
 The Atlantic Philanthropies is awarding UC San Francisco and Trinity College Dublin, $177 million to create the Global Brain Health Institute, a groundbreaking venture to stem the precipitous rise in dementia by training and connecting a new generation of leaders worldwide.[33]"
Azim Premji Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azim_Premji#Azim_Premji_Foundation_And_University	"Azim Hashim Premji (born 24 July 1945) is an Indian business tycoon, investor, engineer, and philanthropist, who is the chairman of Wipro Limited. He is informally known as the Czar of the Indian IT Industry.[5][6] He was responsible for guiding Wipro through four decades of diversification and growth to finally emerge as one of the global leaders in the software industry.[7][8] In 2010, he was voted among the 20 most powerful men in the world by Asiaweek. He has twice been listed among the 100 most influential people by TIME Magazine, once in 2004 and more recently in 2011.[9]
 He is currently the second richest person in India with an estimated net worth of US$21.5 billion as of May 2019. In 2013, he agreed to give away at least half of his wealth by signing The Giving Pledge. Premji started with a $2.2 billion donation to the Azim Premji Foundation, focused on education in India.[10]
 In 1945, Muhammed Hashim Premji incorporated Western Indian Vegetable Products Ltd, based at Amalner, a small town in the Jalgaon district of Maharashtra. It used to manufacture cooking oil under the brand name Sunflower Vanaspati, and a laundry soap called 787, a byproduct of oil manufacture.[11] In 1966, on the news of his father's death, the then 21-year-old Azim Premji returned home from Stanford University, where he was studying engineering, to take charge of Wipro. The company, which was called Western Indian Vegetable Products at the time, dealt in hydrogenated oil manufacturing but Azim Premji later diversified the company to bakery fats, ethnic ingredient based toiletries, hair care soaps, baby toiletries, lighting products, and hydraulic cylinders. In the 1980s, the young entrepreneur, recognising the importance of the emerging IT field, took advantage of the vacuum left behind by the expulsion of IBM from India, changed the company name to Wipro and entered the high-technology sector by manufacturing minicomputers under technological collaboration with an American company Sentinel[12] Computer Corporation.[13] Thereafter Premji made a focused shift from soaps to software.[14]
 Premji was born in Bombay,[1][15] India in a Nizari Ismaili Shia Muslim[16] family with origins from Kutch in Gujarat.[17] His father was a noted businessman and was known as Rice King of Burma. After partition, when Jinnah invited his father Muhammed Hashem Premji to come to Pakistan, he turned down the request and chose to remain in India.[18]
 Premji has a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering degree (equivalent to a Bachelor of Engineering degree) from Stanford University, USA[19]. He is married to Yasmeen. The couple have two children, Rishad and Tariq. Rishad is currently the Chief Strategy Officer of IT Business, Wipro.[20]
 Premji has been recognised by Business Week as one of the Greatest Entrepreneurs for being responsible for Wipro emerging as one of the world's fastest growing companies.[21]
 In 2000, he was conferred an honorary doctorate by the Manipal Academy of Higher Education. In 2006, Azim Premji was awarded Lakshya Business Visionary by National Institute of Industrial Engineering, Mumbai.[22] In 2009, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut for his outstanding philanthropic work.[23] In 2015, Mysore University conferred an honorary doctorate on him.[24]
 In 2005, the Government of India honoured him with the title of Padma Bhushan for his outstanding work in trade and commerce.[25]

 In December 2010, he pledged to donate US$2 billion for improving school education in India. This has been done by transferring 213 million equity shares of Wipro Ltd, held by a few entities controlled by him, to the Azim Premji Trust. This donation is the largest of its kind in India. In March 2019, Premji pledged an additional 34% of Wipro stock held by him to the foundation. At a current value of about USD 7.5 billion, this allocation will bring the total endowment from him to the foundation to USD 21 billion.[29]
 Premji has said that being rich ""did not thrill"" him.[30] He became the first Indian to sign up for The Giving Pledge, a campaign led by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, to encourage the wealthiest people to make a commitment to give most of their wealth to philanthropic causes. He is the third non-American after Richard Branson and David Sainsbury to join this philanthropy club.[31]
 In April 2013 he said that he has already given more than 25 per cent of his personal wealth to charity.[32]
 In July 2015, he gave away an additional 18% of his stake in Wipro, taking his total contribution so far to 39%.[33][34]

Baan Gerda	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baan_Gerda	"BaanGerda is a humanitarian non-profit organization that looks after AIDS orphans in Thailand. It is a project of the Bangkok-based Children's Rights Foundation. The small village community cares for over 70 children that were born with HIV and whose parents died of Aids. The organization has no political or religious associations.
 The children's homes have been built on land donated by a famous monk in the Lopburi province, approximately 230 kilometers north of Bangkok, Thailand. Unlike a state orphanage, BaanGerda has a unique operating model that provides family-style homes for orphans with foster parents looking after the children. All of the parents are HIV positive, thus ensuring they are sensitive to the needs of HIV infected children. It is the only one of its kind in Thailand.
 The founders of BaanGerda are Karl and Tassanee Morsbach, who were originally involved in building schools along the Thai and Burmese border. In total, five schools were built and are now operated by the border police, under the patronage of the King's daughter, Princess Sirindhorn.
 They turned their attention to the growing problem of Aids orphans and opened the first family home at BaanGerda in 2001. It was built with their own money and the intention was to ease the children's suffering in whatever life they have left. When ARV medicine became available, their focus changed as the children were able to live with the disease and lead a relatively normal life. Over the next five years, several more homes were constructed as they were able to raise funds from within Thailand and abroad. In 2006, Germany honored Karl and Tassanee Morsbach for their humanitarian work by awarding them the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit.
 As well as the family homes, BaanGerda comprises an infirmary center with six beds, a guesthouse, an administrative building, and an activities building. One of the most important features is called the “Kinderstern”, which is a multi-purpose building used for eating, a reception center for guests and other events. It was built with the financial support from the artwork Kinderstern  (Children`s Star), a social sculpture which stands since 1988 for the Children`s rights and is made by the German artist Imi Knoebel.
 The recently constructed carpentry and sewing workshops were built to offer the parents a worthwhile job which could boost their confidence and earn them extra money. Many people infected with HIV in Thailand are excluded from jobs, as companies routinely screen potential employees. The production facilities play a vital role in the BaanGerda concept as it provides a vocation for residents and develops their self-esteem. There is also the opportunity for the children to take part in training, which is particularly useful for those that do not attend college later.
 Comprehensive medical treatment is available for all of the adults and children. This includes first and second line ARV medicine and regular blood testing to measure their CD4 count. 
The nearest hospital is located 35 kilometers from the village so everyday medical requirements are taken care of by the resident staff. The medical team distribute ARV medicine to each house and the parents are responsible for ensuring that their children take it at regulated times. Medical records are meticulously kept for each child including weight changes and lab results.
 It is common for children infected with HIV to be excluded from school. However, the children of BaanGerda were fortunate to be accepted at a local school and follow the national standard curriculum. It is part of the King's Project and provides education for those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
 ""HEAVEN'S MEADOW. THE SMALL WONDERS OF BAAN GERDA"" is  a 90 min. documentary by German film director Detlev F. Neufert. It had its premiere in 2005 in Bangkok and shows the beginnings and the 'wonders' of this Aids-village in Thailand. It combines the personal lives of the children with BAAN GERDA as a model for the world and a greater view into the wheel of life. It has been screened internationally in cinemas, schools and universities and TV, even in Bhutan and in China where some billions saw it in CCTV. Hollywood director Wolfgang Petersen names it ""a masterpiece"".[citation needed]
 ""DANCING ON HEAVEN'S MEADOW"". 2009. A 30 min. follow-up by film director Detlev F. Neufert about the life in the Aids orphan village Baan Gerda in Thailand. Ben, one of the leading kids in ""Heaven's Meadow. The small wonders of Baan Gerda"" is now 16 years old. How does he face his life as an Aids orphan and how does the development of Baan Gerda can help him and the other children to lead a normal life. The film has been screened in international TV stations.[citation needed]
 BaanGerda features in the 2010 documentary Living with the Tiger. The film focuses on two of the children over a period of 3 years, and highlights the problems they encounter as they try to re-integrate back into their communities. The story is set in the context of their preparations for an ambitious performance in an opera."
Beckstrand Cancer Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beckstrand_Cancer_Foundation	"Beckstrand Cancer Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization that was founded in 1974 by Dr. Grant Beckstrand and a group of doctors specializing in the treatment and care of cancer patients. 
 The Foundation has four core programs open to the cancer community: the Individual Patient Assistance Program, Psychosocial Pediatric Program, Art Therapy Program, and BELIEVE Holiday Program. The first of the four programs, also known as IPA, has become the cornerstone of the Foundation's outreach to the public. This program targets newly diagnosed cancer patients in Los Angeles County and Orange County who are currently undergoing aggressive cancer treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation, and are experiencing financial hardship as a direct result of their cancer diagnosis. To be considered for this program, patients fill out an application, provide requested documentation, and speak to a licensed social worker. In addition to financial assistance and patient advocacy, many applicants receive supportive counseling and practical help that enables them to cope with critical survival needs.
 Beckstrand Cancer Foundation has become recognizable within the surrounding geographic community by forming three auxiliary groups. The first group, Four Pearls, is an assemblage of young professionals who work to raise awareness and funds on behalf of the Foundation.[1] It was initiated by Lauren Collins, Veronica Muth and Stephanie Muth. The second group, Junior Pearls, is composed of high school aged members who also support the mission of the parent Foundation. It was initiated by Alexandra Spitzer.[2] The third group, Mini Pearls, is for grade school aged children who want to help pediatric cancer patients. It was initiated by Jillian Ray.
 Each of the auxiliaries is branded with a variation of the butterfly seen in the Beckstrand Cancer Foundation logo. In 2008, the Foundation re-branded its logo to incorporate its now signature butterfly, citing the symbolism of the butterfly with respect to change and rebirth. The new design consisted of two sides of individual butterflies coming together to form one, complete butterfly. The Foundation has used the concept of the butterfly effect to encourage its volunteers and supporters to make small changes that can collectively inspire widespread change.
 In 2009, the Foundation marked its 35-year milestone. In recognition of the milestone, Newport Beach Mayor Ed Selich issued a proclamation naming May 3 ""Dr. Grant Beckstrand Day."" [3] The Foundation's supporters chose to highlight the date by participating as ""Team Beckstrand"" in the Orange County Marathon and fundraising on behalf of area patients.
 Individual Patient Assistance Program
 One of the providers of the Individual Patient Assistance Program is Purdue. Purdue helps low income patients by giving them access to their prescription medications at little to no cost.[4]
 Psychosocial Pediatric Program
 The Psychosocial Pediatric Program applies multiple disciplines of behavioral and social sciences to help maintain homeostasis in the quality of life. This involves not only the patient, but the patient's family.[5]
 Art Therapy
 Art Therapy is a specialized psychotherapy that encourages patients to use self-expression to better understand their emotions during life changing or traumatic experiences in their life. By using self-expression, the patients confidence is boosted, giving them more control over their emotions and other difficulties. In Art Therapy, there are many mediums that are utilized from painting in acrylic or watercolor paints, sculpting with found objects or clay, and drawing with graphite. However, with our constantly growing knowledge in technology and pop-culture, Art Therapists also will allow patients to use dance, film, writing, and many other types of medium to express themselves. 
[6]
 BELIEVE Holiday Program
 The BELIEVE Holiday Program provides given amenities of Christmas to families dealing with Cancer.
 Beckstrand Cancer Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that gained its tax exempt status in 1974. The Foundation is compliant with not-for-profit accounting and reporting principles generally accepted by the United States of America. In its most recent 990, it was revealed that eighty percent of every dollar goes directly to patient programs, and operating and fundraising expenses are kept to within twenty percent.
 The Foundation's IPA program helps qualified patients with day-to-day basic needs. Financial assistance may be directed to rent or mortgage payments, utilities, food, gas and transportation, medical insurance premiums, prescriptions or limited treatment. The programs is used as a means for optimizing all available social service avenues. As an example, the Foundation may determine the need to subsidize medical copayments or high insurance bills for a patient, and then additionally help with applications to Medical, SSI and other programs to ensure a limited duration of need. By leveraging its allocations, the IPA program meets urgent needs with almost immediate responsiveness and assures the highest impact for every philanthropic dollar.
 In 2009, Beckstrand Cancer Foundation partnered with Chef Jack Witherspoon to raise awareness for its Psychosocial Pediatric Program. Jack is a 9-year-old pediatric cancer survivor who battled Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) twice, and developed a passion for cooking when he began frequently watching The Food Network during his treatment time at the hospital. Jack used his cooking skills to raise funds for leukemia research and partnered with the Foundation to draw attention to the direct assistance needs of the same patient population. Chef Jack Witherspoon has been interviewed by The Los Angeles Times,[7] CNN, Channel 2 News,[8] and cooked as a guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and The Bonnie Hunt Show.[9] He is now in remission."
Best Friends Animal Society	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Friends_Animal_Society	"Best Friends Animal Society, founded in its present form in 1993,[1] is an American nonprofit 501(c)(3)[5] animal welfare organization. The group does outreach nationwide with shelters, rescue groups and members to promote pet adoption, no-kill animal rescue, and spay-and-neuter practices.[8]
 The group originated in Arizona in 1971,[9] developing from The Foundation Faith of the Millennium, a religious group formerly known as the Process Church of the Final Judgment.[10]
 The Foundation church relocated animals from its Arizona ranch to property in Kanab, Utah, in 1984.[11] In 1991, the church was renamed Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, which became a tax-exempt, nonprofit charity, and in 2003 renamed Best Friends Animal Society.[12]
 After the Foundation church moved to the current grounds in 1984, the founders eventually began informally calling it ""Best Friends"" until 1991 when it began formally operating as Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, a no-kill shelter[13] located in Southwestern Utah in Angel Canyon (formerly Kanab Canyon) near Kanab.[14]
 The sanctuary is on 3,700 acres (15 km2) with an additional 33,000 acres (130 km2) leased from the United States Bureau of Land Management near Zion National Park, the Grand Canyon's North Rim, Bryce Canyon National Park, and Lake Powell. The sanctuary is home to around 1,500 homeless animals.[15]
 National Geographic Channel's DogTown series was filmed at the sanctuary.[16]
 In August 2011, the city of Los Angeles contracted Best Friends to operate and manage its Northeast Valley Shelter, which the city could no longer afford to run. Under the contract, Best Friends was to provide adoptions for shelter animals and spay and neuter services for the community.[17][18]
 The group publishes Best Friends, a bimonthly magazine about animals, animal welfare, news events, and activities at the sanctuary. The magazine, which is distributed free to members, has 200,000 subscribers.[19] Originating as Foundation magazine in 1975 with its interview of Charles Manson referred to as the ""death"" issue,[20] the first edition of Best Friends magazine was published in 1993, two years after the religious group became an animal sanctuary.[21]
 Best Friends’ teams entered the hurricane disaster area on September 2, 2005, and stayed eight months in and around New Orleans.[22] Best Friends did not have a significant presence doing animal disaster rescue or recovery work until Katrina.
 The organization's official role post-Hurricane Katrina was that of a primary animal rescue organization.[23][24]
 Also after Katrina, Best Friends helped Pets Alive, an animal shelter in New York state, and rescuing around 800 cats from an institutional hoarding situation in Nevada.[25] Best Friends also assisted local animal rescue groups following the Peruvian earthquakes of 2007.[26]
 In 2007, Best Friends took in 22 of 47 former NFL quarterback Michael Vick's fighting dogs after petitioning the state of Virginia to save the dogs seized from the Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation.[27] The dogs, once owned by NFL Quarterback Michael Vick, were expected to be euthanized for fear of aggressive behavior.[28] Seven shelters took in the remaining 25 dogs. The court ordered Vick to pay $928,073 in restitution for the “past, present and long-term care of all the dogs.” The court allocated $5,000 for dogs deemed likely to be adopted, and $18,275 for each of the dogs that went into longer-term or lifetime sanctuary care at Best Friends.[27][29]
 In December 2008, Georgia, a former Vick dog, appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Best Friends dog trainer John Garcia.[30] The two also appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live"".[31]
 The ensuing story of rehabilitation was profiled in an episode of the National Geographic Channel program DogTown. Dogtown's producer, Darcy Dennett, later approached Best Friends about a feature-length documentary on the same story.[32] Released in October 2015, ‘’The Champions’’ covers the stories of five of the dogs in detail, and the impact the dogs have had not just on the people who adopted them, but also on the way society looks at dogs rescued from fighting cases, and the pit bull breed especially.[33] The film received the 2015 Zelda Penzel ""Giving Voice to the Voiceless"" award at the 2015 Hamptons International Film Festival.[34]
 The film features the work of both Best Friends Animal Society and BAD RAP, an Oakland-based animal welfare rescue group.
 FilmRise acquired the rights to the film in November 2015.[35] The Champions was released theatrically through a series of community screenings[36] and became available for digital download on March 1, 2016.[37]
 In August 2008, Best Friends and PetSmart Charities funded a program called ""Feral Freedom"" for free-roaming community cats in Jacksonville, Florida.[38][39] The program was conceived by Rick Ducharme of First Coast No More Homeless Pets.
 Similar programs were funded with a grant from PetSmart Charities and implemented by Best Friends in Albuquerque, New Mexico; DeKalb County, Georgia; San Antonio, Texas; Baltimore, Maryland; Osceola County, Florida; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;[40] and other communities.[41] In St. George, Utah, the city partnered with Best Friends on a trap-neuter-return program in January 2013.[42]"
Bharat Sevashram Sangha	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Sevashram_Sangha	"Bharat Sevashram Sangha (Bengali: ভারত সেবাশ্রম সংঘ) is a Hindu charitable non-governmental organisation in India. It was founded in 1917[1] by Acharya Srimat Swami Pranavanandaji Maharaj.[2] The Sangha has hundreds of ashrams in India and other countries including the United Kingdom, United States, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Canada, Fiji and Bangladesh.[citation needed] It has initiated several missions to African countries, Malaysia, and Indonesia; monks from the Sangha have accompanied United Nations delegations to Syria and Lebanon.[citation needed]
 The Sangha is recognized for their community work, helping poor and providing healthcare to those in need. 
 The Sangha has responded to natural calamities in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa states, the Bengal famine of 1943, the Bhopal disaster, the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.[1] At times of political unrest such as the Partition of India, the Sangha has set up refugee camps and war evacuee camps in the border areas.[citation needed]
 It has organised several projects to help impoverished Indian tribal people. One such project involved providing schooling for children of the Sabar tribe and providing them with housing and healthcare.[3] It also hosts courses to train youths in information technology to enable them to find jobs which require IT skills.[4]
 Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the Sangha's monks proposed to set up a school for orphans at a cost of Rs. 4250,000s, an orphanage at Rs.6020,000, and 200 houses at Rs.30 millions on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.[5] In Tamil Nadu state, where the tsunami killed more than 7,000 in the districts of Cuddalore, Nagapattinam and Chennai, the Sangha was one of the first to begin massive relief operations by building nearly 200 new houses at Sonankuppam village in Cuddaloer. Fishing boats and nets were also distributed to locals who had lost everything to the sea.[citation needed]
 The Sangha actively provides shelter, food, medical treatment and public safety services to pilgrims at various places of worship and religious fairs in India, such as the Kumbha Mela.[citation needed] It operates free hospitals at Barajuri and Kolkata, mobile dispensary and medical units in sixty-four locations, a free residence for patients and their families in Navi Mumbai, and four hospitals and homes for leprosy patients.[6] A 500-bed hospital at Joka, Kolkata was inaugurated in 2010 by the Indian Finance Minister as an example of private-public partnerships in healthcare.[6]"
Big Brothers Big Sisters of America	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brothers_Big_Sisters_of_America	"Big Brothers Big Sisters of America is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization whose goal is to help all children reach their potential through professionally supported, one-to-one relationships with volunteer mentors.
 Big Brothers Big Sisters is one of the oldest and largest youth mentoring organizations in the United States. Big Brothers Big Sisters mentors children, all ages in communities across the country.
 The group holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code.
 Public/Private Ventures, an independent Philadelphia-based national research organization, conducted a study from 1994–95, monitoring 950 boys and girls nationwide to study the effects of Big Brothers Big Sisters. Out of the 950 children, half were randomly chosen to be matched, and the others were put on a waiting list. According to the study the matched children meet with their Big Brother or Sister about three times a month for a year.
 After surveying the children at the beginning of the study, and again after 18 months, the researchers found that the Little Brothers and Little Sisters, compared to those children not in the program, were:
 They also found that the Littles were more confident of their performance in schoolwork and got along better with their families.[6]
 ""We have known all along that Big Brothers Big Sisters' mentoring has a long-lasting, positive effect on children's confidence, grades, and social skills,"" affirms Karen J. Mathis, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America’s Past President and CEO, ""and the results of this impact study scientifically confirm that belief.""
 ""These dramatic findings are very good news, particularly at a time when many people contend that 'nothing works' in reaching teenagers,"" said Gary Walker, then-President of Public/Private Ventures. ""This program suggests a strategy the country can build on to make a difference, especially for youth in single-parent families.""[6]
 Public/Private Ventures conducted another study in 2011 that evaluated the school-based Big Brothers Big Sisters Program.  Unlike the conventional community-based Big Brothers Big Sisters where Bigs and Littles can engage in their activities in any setting, some Big Brothers Big Sisters agencies offer opportunities for school-based mentoring.  In this type of mentoring, the Bigs meet with their Littles at their school – whether it is in the classroom or on the playground.[7]  Public/Private Ventures randomly assigned 1,139 nine- to sixteen-year-old students in either a treatment group that received mentoring or a control group that did not receive mentoring.  They followed the students for 1.5 school years.  The outcomes that the researchers measured fell into three broad categories: school-related performance and attitudes, problem behaviors, and social and personal well-being.  At the end of the first school year, compared to the control group, mentored youth performed better academically, had more positive perceptions of their own academic abilities, and were more likely to report having a “special adult” in their lives.  However, the mentored youth did not show improvements in classroom effort; global self-worth; relationships with parents, teachers, or peers; and rates of problem behavior.  Academic improvements were also not sustained into the second school year.  The researchers predict that more permanent changes in the youth's school performance might depend on more fundamental changes that do not occur in the first year of involvement.[8]
 In a recent review, Big Brothers Big Sisters was selected by Forbes magazine as one of its top ten charities, making the publication’s “gold star” list of charities worthy of donor consideration. The magazine surveyed 200 non-profits and rated them on how efficiently they collect and distribute dollars. Forbes looked at three categories: charitable commitment; fundraising efficiency, and donor dependency.
 Big Brothers Big Sisters of America received a rating of two out of a potential four stars. Charity Navigator, America’s premier charity evaluator. The low rating is due to the 23.3% of expenses that are used for things other than programming expenses.[9]
 Big Brothers Big Sisters of America meets the BBB Wise Giving Alliance's Standards for Charity Accountability.[10]
 Big Brothers Big Sisters received the American Institute of Philanthropy's highest rating, an A+.[11]
 On June 24, 2013, The United States Department of Justice issued an Audit Report that stated it was freezing the disbursement of all grant funds to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America (BBBSA), noting that the organization was ""in material non-compliance with the majority of the grant requirements"" that were tested by the audit.  The audit also noted that ""as a result of these weaknesses"", the agency ""questioned $19,462,448 in funding that the grantee has received and recommended the $3,714,838 in funds not yet disbursed be put to better use"".  The audit further stated that ""most significantly"", it ""found that BBBSA's practices for recording and supporting grant-related expenditures were inadequate to safeguard grant funds and ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the grants"".[citation needed]
 Since 2013, Big Brothers has replaced its management team and begun implementing policies governing the use of federal grant funds.
 “We appreciate the support of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Civil Division in working with us on these kinds of cases,” said Department of Justice Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz.  “The OIG’s auditors and investigators will continue to work with each other closely to uncover misuses of grant funds, and with our law enforcement partners to ensure that justice is served.”
 In addition to paying the United States $1.6 million, and as part of the settlement, Big Brothers has agreed to institute a strict compliance program that requires the organization to engage in regular audits, both internally and by independent auditors; establish a compliance team, an employee code of conduct, whistleblower policies and a disciplinary policy for employees who engage in or fail to disclose abuses of federal grant funds; provide regular employee training on these policies; and employ risk assessment tools to detect abuses that might otherwise go undetected.
 The settlement was the result of a coordinated effort between the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch.  The Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General conducted the investigation.
 The claims resolved by this settlement are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability.[12]
 In 1904, a young New York City court clerk named Ernest Kent Coulter was seeing many boys come through his courtroom. He recognized that caring adults could help many of these boys stay out of trouble, and he set out to find volunteers. That marked the beginning of Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City and the Big Brothers movement. By 1916, Big Brothers had spread to 96 cities across the country.
 At around the same time, the members of a group called Ladies of Charity were befriending girls who had come through the New York Children’s Court. That group would later become Catholic Big Sisters, an independent organization.
 In 1958, the Big Brothers Association was granted a Congressional charter. Big Sisters International was founded in 1970. Both groups continued to work independently until 1977, when Big Brothers of America and Big Sisters International joined forces and became Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.
 Big Brothers Big Sisters currently operates in all 50 states and in 13 countries around the world, including Australia, Austria, Bermuda, Bulgaria, Canada, Cayman Islands, Ireland, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Trinidad and Tobago.[13]
 Big Brothers Big Sisters International was founded in 1998. BBBS International's mission is to promote and support the development of Big Brothers Big Sisters mentoring programs throughout the world, operating independently in various countries. This is done by providing consultation, technical assistance, training and materials for NGOs wanting to develop this mentoring model.
 Big Brothers Big Sisters International headquarters is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."
Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brothers_Big_Sisters_of_Canada	"Big Brothers Big Sisters is a non-profit federation with a focus on mentoring programs for youth since 1913. The Big Brothers Big Sisters movement in Canada provides services to 41,700 youth in over 1,100 communities.[1]
 Big Brothers Big Sisters agencies offer a range of mentoring programs to meet the needs of Canadian children and families. In the traditional one-to-one mentoring programs, one youth and one adult mentor meet twice a month for at least one year. Big Brothers Big Sisters also operates group mentoring programs for teenagers and clubs for newcomer Canadian youth.[2]
 In 2013, the Boston Consulting Group conducted a research study on the impact of Big Brothers Big Sisters mentoring programs. The study concluded that every dollar spent on Big Brothers Big Sisters results in a $18-$23 social return on investment based on increased earnings, charitable contributions, and volunteerism. In addition, former mentees described the mentoring relationship as a ""transformational moment"" that improved their confidence, happiness, and mental health.[3]
 The youth mentoring movement began in the USA in 1904[4], when a young New York City court clerk named Ernest Coulter was seeing more and more boys come through his courtroom. He recognized that caring adults could help many of these kids stay out of trouble, and he set out to find volunteers. He asked a number of his friends to spend some of their time – lending a hand to youngsters, starting with 39 volunteers. That marked the beginning of the Big Brothers movement. By 1916, Big Brothers had spread to 96 cities across the United States.[5]
 In 1912, similar events took place in Canada and the first Canadian Big Sister agency formed in Toronto [6]. Closely afterwards, in 1913, the first Canadian Big Brother program began in Toronto. Both groups continued to work independently until 1977, when Big Brothers of America and Big Sisters International (in America) joined forces and became Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. In 2001 a similar merger occurred between the two Canadian organizations and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada was formed. Interest grew from outside North America, spurring the formation of Big Brothers Big Sisters International to help other countries get started and facilitate communications between countries running similar programs.[5]"
Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brothers_Big_Sisters_of_New_York_City	"Big Brothers Big Sisters of NYC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in New York City, whose mission is to help children reach their potential through professionally supported, one-to-one relationships with mentors that try to have a measurable impact on youth. Big Brothers Big Sisters of NYC is one of the oldest and largest youth mentoring organizations in the United States, and has served over 100,000 children since its founding in 1904.[1]
 In 1904, a young New York City court clerk named Ernest Kent Coulter was seeing many boys come through his courtroom. He recognized that caring adults could help many of these boys stay out of trouble, so in 1904, he set out to find volunteers and made his famous plea:
 ""There is only one possible way to save that youngster, and that is to have some earnest, true man volunteer to be his big brother. To look after him, to help him do right, to make the little chap feel that there is at least one human being in this great city who takes a personal interest in him, who cares whether he lives or dies. I call for a volunteer.""
 That marked the beginning of Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City and the Big Brothers movement.
 When the first gentleman stood to volunteer, Big Brothers of New York City (the founding member of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America) began. Coulter's audience, a New York City men's club of business and community leaders, immediately saw the strength of this brave new idea. By the end of the day, 39 men had volunteered, and thus 39 futures were salvaged.
 By 1916, Big Brothers had spread to 96 cities across the country.
 Eight years later, in June 1912, Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt helped to form the “Big Sisters” organization. In 1921, the Big Brother and Big Sister Federation incorporated in New York State.
 In October 2010, Hector Batista was appointed as the new executive director of Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City.
[2] Mr. Batista has devoted most of his life to public service, and has served as a leader of large government departments as well as non-profit and private organizations.
 Mr. Batista began his career in the Brooklyn Borough President's office, where over the course of nine years, he served as director of real estate for the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation, director of economic development and director of development and finance. He was later appointed by New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to serve as deputy commissioner and chief operating officer of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
 During his time in the private sector, Mr. Batista was the managing director and chief operating officer at Jeffrey M. Brown Associates, Builders and Construction Managers, where he was responsible for projects in eighteen states and an operating budget of $450 million.
 Mr. Batista also served as executive vice president of the New York Metropolitan Region of the American Cancer Society, where he provided strategic and operational leadership through nearly 200 employees, 2000 volunteers and 12 offices in Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Westchester County. He was a powerful voice in the successful campaign to ban smoking in most New York City restaurants and public places. He was also a strong advocate for improving the health of the City's youth, by promoting better quality food in the schools and by reducing the sale of junk food.[3]
 Before coming to Big Brothers Big Sisters of NYC, Mr. Batista spent several years as CEO of the Way to Work (formerly known as Vocational Foundation, Inc.), where he oversaw one of the nation's leading youth workforce development programs.[4]

 Youth and volunteers meet anywhere, anytime (it's up to the adult mentor, the little brother or sister, and the parent/guardian). ""Bigs"" and ""Littles"" meet at least twice a month (usually on weekends) and spend time together one-to-one on their own, planning and participating in activities of their choice. The time commitment is eight hours per month, for one year.
 The largest program, serving ages 7–17, work with adult mentors. Bronx and Queens Borough Partnership Program youth, who reside in underserved neighborhoods, meet with their mentors to explore the borough as well as other communities.
 In response to the tragic events of September 11, Big Brothers Big Sisters NYC initiated this program to provide long-term help for children who lost a parent or close relative in the World Trade Center attacks.
 The program is for youth who lost a parent in the FDNY line of duty, including, but not limited to September 11th. Mentors are men and women who are active or retired firefighters, those that work for the FDNY and are relatives of individuals in the FDNY.
 These youth are first generation Americans facing the challenge of balancing two worlds: the culture of their family and country of origin, and the culture of their school peers and New York City.
 Teenage mothers in need of a friend, as well as information on resources available to them.
 Programs meet regularly at a designated time at a specific location. They generally meet only during the school year and are supervised by an on-site social worker. Matches are one-to-one, with occasional group activities.

Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation	"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), previously  the William H. Gates Foundation, is a private foundation founded by Bill and Melinda Gates. Based in Seattle, Washington, it was launched in 2000 and is reported to be the largest private foundation in the world,[4] holding $50.7 billion in assets.[5] The primary aims of the foundation are, globally, to enhance healthcare and reduce extreme poverty, and, in the U.S., to expand educational opportunities and access to information technology. The foundation is controlled by its three trustees: Bill and Melinda Gates, and Warren Buffett. Other principal officers include Co-Chair William H. Gates, Sr. and Chief Executive Officer Susan Desmond-Hellmann.[6]
 It had an endowment of $50.7 billion as of December 31, 2017[update].[3] The scale of the foundation and the way it seeks to apply business techniques to giving makes it one of the leaders in venture philanthropy,[7] though the foundation itself notes that the philanthropic role has limitations.[8] In 2007, its founders were ranked as the second most generous philanthropists in the US, and Warren Buffett the first.[9] As of May 16, 2013, Bill Gates had donated $28 billion to the foundation.[1][10] Since its founding, the foundation has endowed and supported a broad range of social, health, and education developments including the establishment of the Gates Cambridge Scholarships at Cambridge University.
 In 1994, the foundation was formed as the William H. Gates Foundation.[11] During the foundation's following years, funding grew to $2 billion. On June 15, 2006, Gates announced his plans to transition out of a day-to-day role with Microsoft, effective July 31, 2008,[12] to allow him to devote more time to working with the foundation.
 In 2005, Bill and Melinda Gates, along with the musician Bono, were named by Time as Persons of the Year 2005 for their outstanding charitable work.[13] In the case of Bill and Melinda Gates, the work referenced was that of this foundation.
 In April 2010, Gates was invited to visit and speak at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he asked the students to take on the hard problems of the world in their futures. He also explained the nature and philosophy of his philanthropic endeavors.[14][15]
 In 2010, the foundation's founders started the Commission on Education of Health Professionals for the 21st Century, entitled ""Transforming education to strengthen health systems in an interdependent world.""[16]
 A 2011 survey of grantees found that many believed the foundation did not make its goals and strategies clear and sometimes did not understand those of the grantees; that the foundation's decision- and grantmaking procedures were too opaque; and that its communications could be more consistent and responsive. The foundation's response was to improve the clarity of its explanations, make ""orientation calls"" to grantees upon awarding grants, tell grantees who their foundation contact is, give timely feedback when they receive a grantee report, and establish a way for grantees to provide anonymous or attributed feedback to the foundation.[17] The foundation also launched a podcast series.[18]
 In 2013, Hillary Clinton launched a partnership between the foundation and the Clinton Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the 1995 United Nations Fourth World Conference On Women in Beijing.[19][20] This is called ""No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project.""[19][20]
 On June 25, 2006, Warren Buffett (then the world's richest person, estimated worth of $62 billion as of April 16, 2008) pledged to give the foundation approximately 10 million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares spread over multiple years through annual contributions, with the first year's donation of 500,000 shares being worth approximately $1.5 billion.[21] Buffett set conditions so that these contributions do not simply increase the foundation's endowment, but effectively work as a matching contribution, doubling the foundation's annual giving. Bloomberg News noted, ""Buffett's gift came with three conditions for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: Bill or Melinda Gates must be alive and active in its administration; it must continue to qualify as a charity; and each year it must give away an amount equal to the previous year's Berkshire gift, plus an additional amount equal to 5 percent of net assets. Buffett gave the foundation two years to abide by the third requirement.""[22][23][24] The Gates Foundation received 5% (500,000) of the shares in July 2006 and will receive 5% of the remaining earmarked shares in the July of each following year (475,000 in 2007, 451,250 in 2008).[25][26] In July 2018, Buffet announced another donation of his company's Class B stock, this time worth $2 billion, to the Gates Foundation.[27]
 To maintain its status as a charitable foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation must donate funds equal to at least 5 percent of its assets each year.[28] As of April 2014, the foundation is organized into four program areas under chief executive officer Susan Desmond-Hellmann, who ""sets strategic priorities, monitors results, and facilitates relationships with key partners"":[29]
 The foundation maintains an online database of grants on its website which includes for each grant the name of the grantee organization, the purpose of the grant and the amount.[31] This database is publicly available.
 In November 2014, the Gates Foundation announced that they were adopting an open access (OA) policy for publications and data, ""to enable the unrestricted access and reuse of all peer-reviewed published research funded by the foundation, including any underlying data sets"".[32] This move has been widely applauded by those who are working in the area of capacity building and knowledge sharing.[citation needed] Its terms have been called the most stringent among similar OA policies.[33] As of January 1, 2015 their Open Access policy is effective for all new agreements.[34] In March 2017, it was confirmed that the open access policy, Gates Open Research[35] would be based on the same initiative launched in 2016 by Wellcome Trust in their Wellcome Open Research policy[36] launched in partnership with F1000 Research.[37][38] The Gates Foundation supported Our World in Data, a widely used publication on global change and one of the world's largest open-access publications.[39] Bill Gates called the publication his ""favorite website"".[40]
 The following table lists the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's committed funding as recorded in their International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) publications. The Gates Foundation announced in October 2013 that it would join the IATI.[41] The IATI publications only include a subset of Gates Foundation grants (mainly excluding grants to developed countries), and contain few grants before 2009 (which are excluded from the table).[42] The Gates Foundation states on the IATI Registry site that ""reporting starts from 2009 and excludes grants related to our US programs and grants that if published could harm our employees, grantees, partners, or the beneficiaries of our work"".[43]
 The following table lists the top receiving organizations to which the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has committed funding, between 2009 and 2015. The table again only includes grants recorded in the Gates Foundation's IATI publications.[42]
 The foundation explains on its website that its trustees divided the organization into two entities: the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. The foundation section, based in Seattle, US, ""focuses on improving health and alleviating extreme poverty"", and its trustees are Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. The trust section manages ""the investment assets and transfer proceeds to the foundation as necessary to achieve the foundation's charitable goals""—it holds the assets of Bill and Melinda Gates, who are the sole trustees, and receives contributions from Buffett.[45]
 The foundation posts its audited financial statements and 990-PF forms on the ""Financials"" section of its website as they become available. At the end of 2012, the foundation registered a cash sum of $4,998,000, down from $10,810,000 at the end of 2011. Unrestricted net assets at the end of 2012 were worth $31,950,613,000, while total assets were worth $37,176,777,000.[46]
 As of 30 September 2018[update], according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the trust owned the following investments:[47]
 Christopher Elias leads the foundation's efforts to combat extreme poverty through grants as president of the Global Development Program.[48]
 In March 2006, the foundation announced a $5 million grant for the International Justice Mission (IJM), a human rights organization based in Washington, D.C., US to work in the area of sex trafficking. The official announcement explained that the grant would allow the IJM to ""create a replicable model for combating sex trafficking and slavery"" that would involve the opening of an office in a region with high rates of sex trafficking, following research. The office was opened for three years for the following purposes: ""conducting undercover investigations, training law enforcement, rescuing victims, ensuring appropriate aftercare, and seeking perpetrator accountability"".[49]
 The IJM used the grant money to found ""Project Lantern"" and established an office in the Philippines city of Cebu.[50][51] In 2010, the results of the project were published, in which the IJM stated that Project Lantern had led to ""an increase in law enforcement activity in sex trafficking cases, an increase in commitment to resolving sex trafficking cases among law enforcement officers trained through the project, and an increase in services – like shelter, counseling and career training – provided to trafficking survivors"". At the time that the results were released, the IJM was exploring opportunities to replicate the model in other regions.[52]
 In October 2000, William Gates established the Gates Cambridge Scholarships which allow students and scholars from the U.S. and around the world to study at Cambridge University, one of the top universities in the world. The Gates Cambridge Scholarship has often been compared to the Rhodes Scholarship, given its similarly international scope and substantial endowment. In 2000, the Gates Foundation endowed the scholarship trust with $210 million to help outstanding graduate students outside of the United Kingdom study at the University of Cambridge.[53] The Gates Foundation has continued to contribute funds to expand the scholarship, making it one of the largest and best endowed scholarships in the world. The Gates Cambridge Scholarship accepts less than 0.3% of applicants and remains extremely competitive. Each year, approximately 100 new graduate students from around the world receive funding to study at Cambridge University.
 The Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was launched in mid-2005 as a ""Learning Initiative"", and became a full-fledged program under the Global Development Division in early 2010.[60] The foundation has since 2005 undertaken a wide range of efforts in the WASH sector involving research, experimentation, reflection, advocacy, and field implementation. In 2009, the foundation decided to refocus its WASH effort mainly on sustainable sanitation services for the poor, using non-piped sanitation services (i.e. without the use of sewers),[60] and less on water supply. This was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments, and because the foundation believed it had the potential to make a real difference through strategic investments.
 In mid 2011, the foundation announced in its new ""Water, Sanitation, Hygiene Strategy Overview"" that its funding now focuses primarily on sanitation, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions.[61] Their grant-making focus has been since 2011 on sanitation science and technology (""transformative technologies""), delivery models at scale, urban sanitation markets, building demand for sanitation, measurement and evaluation as well as policy, advocacy and communications.[60][61]
 In mid 2011, the foundation stated that they had committed more than $265 million to the water, sanitation, and hygiene sector over the past five years, i.e. since about 2006.[61] For the time period of about 2008 to mid 2015, all grants awarded to water, sanitation and hygiene projects totaled a value of around $650 million, according to the publicly available grant database.[31]
 Improved sanitation in the developing world is a global need, but a neglected priority, as shown by the data collected by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) of UNICEF and WHO. This program is tasked to monitor progress towards the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) relating to drinking water and sanitation.[62] About one billion people have no sanitation facility whatsoever and continue to defecate in gutters, behind bushes or in open water bodies, with no dignity or privacy. This is called open defecation and it poses significant health risks.[63] India is the country with the highest number of people practicing open defecation: around 600 million people.[64] The foundation has been funding many sanitation research and demonstration projects in India since about 2011.[65]
 In 2011, the foundation launched a program called ""Reinvent the Toilet Challenge"" with the aim to promote the development of innovations in toilet design to benefit the 2.5 billion people that do not have access to safe and effective sanitation.[66][67] This program has generated significant interest of the mainstream media.[68][69] It was complemented by a program called ""Grand Challenges Explorations"" (2011 to 2013 with some follow-up grants reaching until 2015) which involved grants of $100,000 each in the first round.[67] Both funding schemes explicitly excluded project ideas that relied on centralized sewerage systems or are not compatible with development country contexts.[70]
 Since the launch of the ""Reinvent the Toilet Challenge"", more than a dozen research teams, mainly at universities in the U.S., Europe, India, China and South Africa, have received grants to develop innovative on-site and off-site waste treatment solutions for the urban poor. The grants were in the order of $400,000 for their first phase, followed by typically $1 million – 3 million for their second phase; many of them investigated resource recovery or processing technologies for excreta or fecal sludge.[71]
 The ""Reinvent the Toilet Challenge"" is focused on ""reinventing the flush toilet"". The aim was to create a toilet that not only removes pathogens from human excreta, but also recovers resources such as energy, clean water, and nutrients (a concept also known as reuse of excreta). It should operate ""off-the-grid"" without connections to water, sewer, or electrical networks. Finally, it should costs less than 5 cents per user per day.[70][72]
 High-tech toilets for tackling the growing public health problem of human waste are gaining increasing attention, but this focus on a ""technology fix"" has also been criticized by many in the sector.[68] However, low-tech solutions may be more practical in poor countries, and research is also funded by the foundation for such toilets.[73][72]
 The Reinvent the Toilet Challenge is a long-term research and development effort to develop a hygienic, stand-alone toilet. This challenge is being complemented by another investment program to develop new technologies for improved pit latrine emptying (called by the foundation the ""Omni-Ingestor""[74]) and fecal sludge processing (called ""Omni-Processor""). The aim of the ""Omni Processor"" is to convert excreta (for example fecal sludge) into beneficial products such as energy and soil nutrients with the potential to develop local business and revenue.[75]
 Some examples include:
 Since 2011, the president of the Global Health Program is Trevor Mundel.[91]
 The foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases.[94] However, a 2007 investigation by The Los Angeles Times[94] claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundation's allocation of aid. First, sub-Saharan Africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the Gates Foundation, but ""by pouring most contributions into the fight against such high-profile killers as AIDS, Gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained, higher-paid clinicians, diverting staff from basic care"" in sub-Saharan Africa. This ""brain drain"" adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers. Second, ""the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation"".[94] Third, ""Gates-funded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations cannot prevent"".[94]
 In response, the Gates Foundation has said that African governments need to spend more of their budgets on public health than on wars, that the foundation has donated at least $70 million to help improve nutrition and agriculture in Africa, in addition to its disease-related initiatives and that it is studying ways to improve the delivery of health care in Africa.[94]
 Both insiders and external critics have suggested that there is too much deference to Bill Gates's personal views within the Gates Foundation, insufficient internal debate, and pervasive ""group think.""[93][95] Critics also complain that Gates Foundation grants are often awarded based on social connections and ideological allegiances rather than based on formal external review processes or technical competence.[95]
 Critics have suggested that Gates' approach to Global Health and Agriculture favors the interests of large pharmaceutical and agribusiness companies (in which Gates invests) over the interests of the people of developing countries.[96][97][98][99]
 The Global Health Program's other significant grants include:
 Under President Allan Golston, the United States Program has made grants such as the following:
 Up to 2013, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided $71 million to Planned Parenthood and affiliated organizations. In 2014, Melinda Gates has stated that the foundation ""has decided not to fund abortion"", focusing instead on family planning and contraception in order to avoid conflation of abortion and family planning.[121] In response to questions about this decision, Gates stated in a June 2014 blog post that ""[she], like everyone else, struggle[s] with the issue"" and that ""the emotional and personal debate about abortion is threatening to get in the way of the lifesaving consensus regarding basic family planning"".[121] Since this time, their endeavors have shifted to a more global perspective, focusing on voluntary family planning and maternal and newborn health.[122][123]
 In 1997, the charity introduced a U.S. Libraries initiative with a goal of ""ensuring that if you can get to a public library, you can reach the internet"". Only 35% of the world's population has access to the Internet.[124] The foundation has given grants, installed computers and software, and provided training and technical support in partnership with public libraries nationwide in an effort to increase access and knowledge.[124] Helping provide access and training for these resources, this foundation helps move public libraries into the digital age.[124]
 Most recently, the foundation gave a $12.2 million grant to the Southeastern Library Network (SOLINET) to assist libraries in Louisiana and Mississippi on the Gulf Coast, many of which were damaged or destroyed by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
 A key aspect of the Gates Foundation's U.S. efforts involves an overhaul of the country's education policies at both the K-12 and college levels, including support for teacher evaluations and charter schools and opposition to seniority-based layoffs and other aspects of the education system that are typically backed by teachers' unions.[125] It spent $373 million on education in 2009.[125] It has also donated to the two largest national teachers' unions.[125] The foundation was the biggest early backer of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.[125] In October 2017 it was announced that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation would spend more than $1.7 billion over five years to pay for new initiatives in public education.[126]
 One of the foundation's goals is to lower poverty by increasing the number of college graduates in the United States, and the organization has funded ""Reimagining Aid Design and Delivery"" grants to think tanks and advocacy organizations to produce white papers on ideas for changing the current system of federal financial aid for college students, with a goal of increasing graduation rates.[127][128] One of the ways the foundation has sought to increase the number of college graduates is to get them through college faster, but that idea has received some pushback from organizations of universities and colleges.[129]
 As part of its education-related initiatives, the foundation has funded journalists, think tanks, lobbying organizations and governments. Millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education, including more than $1.4 million to the Education Writers Association to fund training for journalists who cover education.[130] While some critics have feared the foundation for directing the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage, the foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly and does not enforce any rules for content among its grantees, who have editorial independence.[125][130][131] Union activists in Chicago have accused Gates Foundation grantee Teach Plus, which was founded by new teachers and advocates against seniority-based layoffs, of ""astroturfing"".[125]
 The K-12 and higher education reform programs of the Gates Foundation have been criticized by some education professionals, parents, and researchers because they have driven the conversation on education reform to such an extent that they may marginalize researchers who do not support Gates' predetermined policy preferences.[127] Several Gates-backed policies such as small schools, charter schools, and increasing class sizes have been expensive and disruptive, but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm.[132][133]
 Examples of some of the K-12 reforms advocated by the foundation include closing ineffective neighborhood schools in favor of privately run charter schools; extensively using standardized test scores to evaluate the progress of students, teachers, and schools; and merit pay for teachers based on student test scores. Critics also believe that the Gates Foundation exerts too much influence over public education policy without being accountable to voters or taxpayers.
[132][134][135]
 Some of the foundation's educational initiatives have included:
 Critics say the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has overlooked the links between poverty and poor academic achievement, and has unfairly demonized teachers for poor achievement by underprivileged students. They contend that the Gates Foundation should be embracing anti-poverty and living wage policies rather than pursuing untested and empirically unsupported education reforms.[153]
 Critics say that Gates-backed reforms such as increasing the use of technology in education may financially benefit Microsoft and the Gates family.[127][154][155][156][157]
 The foundation trust invests undistributed assets, with the exclusive goal of maximizing the return on investment. As a result, its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the foundation is attempting to relieve poverty.[77][158] These include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world.[159]
In response to press criticism, the foundation announced in 2007 a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.[160] It subsequently cancelled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[161][162]
 Critics have called on the Gates Foundation to end its investments in the GEO Group, the second largest private prison corporation in the United States. A large part of the prison's work involves incarcerating and detaining migrants that have been detained by the Obama administration and now the Trump administration.[163][164][165] In spring 2014 the Gates Foundation acknowledged its $2.2 million investment in the prison corporation.[166] It has more recently rebuffed critics' request that it sever investment ties with the prison corporation. It has refused to comment on whether it is continuing its investments.[167][163]
 In October 2006, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was split into two entities: the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which manages the endowment assets and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which ""... conducts all operations and grantmaking work, and it is the entity from which all grants are made"".[168][169] Also announced was the decision to ""... spend all of [the Trust's] resources within 20[170] years after Bill's and Melinda's deaths"".[171][172][173][174] This would close the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust and effectively end the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In the same announcement it was reiterated that Warren Buffett ""... has stipulated that the proceeds from the Berkshire Hathaway shares he still owns at death are to be used for philanthropic purposes within 10 years after his estate has been settled"".[171]
 The plan to close the Foundation Trust is in contrast to most large charitable foundations that have no set closure date. This is intended to lower administrative costs over the years of the Foundation Trust's life and ensure that the Foundation Trust not fall into a situation where the vast majority of its expenditures are on administrative costs, including salaries, with only token amounts contributed to charitable causes.[172]

Bilqees Sarwar Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilqees_Sarwar_Foundation	"The Bilqees Sarwar Foundation (BSF) is a registered non-profit organization based in Lahore, Pakistan, which provides public health and education support to the local community as well as around the world. It was established by the Sarwar family, and cooperates with NRS International, a Dubai-based disaster relief supplier with a manufacturing facility in Pakistan.
 The Bilqees Sarwar Hospital (BSH) provides the employees of the HSNDS factory, their family, and patients in Pakistan with free and subsidized healthcare; this includes 50 dialysis machines to use without a cost and free eye-care treatments ranging from laser vision correction to minor surgeries. Since its inception, the hospital has served a community of 500,000 citizens and treats up to 3,000 eye patients per month. The hospital offers a range of other services, including:
 In June, 2016 BSF established Razia Begum Dialysis Centre (RBDC) near Kahna, to treat patients suffering from kidney disease free of charge.[1] The centre provides free dialysis to up to 4,500 patients on a monthly basis, and has provided 5,792 dialysis treatment to date.
 BSF has supported Alseeraj for Development and Healthcare in order for it to continue its mobile medical clinic in Syrian refugee camps in eastern Lebanon.
 BSF has donated to several departments of Mayo Hospital in Punjab, Pakistan:[2]
 BSF has granted 77 scholarships worth USD 33,398 to students at the Customs Public School in Lahore[3]. The scholarship programme supports young students from the age of 3 to 13. BSF has also donated USD 11,450 in the form of 40 scholarships to Sanjan Nagar Public Education Trust for impoverished students. BSF also partnered with The City School in Lahore to sponsor the 7th Annual City School Model United Nations Conference.[4]
 The Bilqees Sarwar Foundation's parent company, NRS International, joined the Global Business Coalition for Education to extend their support towards the education of Syrian refugee children.

Blessing Bethlehem	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessing_Bethlehem	"Blessing Bethlehem is a charity fundraising initiative with the purpose of helping the persecuted Christians living in the city of Bethlehem and its surrounding areas.[1] It was launched in September 2016 by Rabbi Pesach Wolicki, of the Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC), at the LifeLight Festival in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.[2]
 In 2015, Rabbi Pesach Wolicki traveled to Sioux Falls, as part of an educational effort on behalf of CJCUC, where he heard about a local food drive at Faith Temple. Later, upon meeting Pastor Naim Khory of Jerusalem, a decision was made to extend the group's efforts in the direction of feeding Bethlehem’s poor.[2]
 In a September 2016 piece for the Argus Leader, Wolicki stated that in the Book of Moses, Jews are commanded by God to “care for the stranger in their midst” explaining that the Christian population of Bethlehem is ""not in a country like Syria or Iraq where we don’t have access to them and can’t help them - We can help them"". He also stated that the Jewish people are mainly concerned about the persecution of Christians throughout the world due to the history of persecution experienced by the Jews themselves.
 In a September 2018 interview, Wolicki further elaborated on the importance of establishing ""Blessing Bethlehem"" stating that ""Covenant land requires covenantal responsibility.""[3]"

 In January 2014, the Obesity Prevention Program and other health advocates in Mexico successfully lobbied for the passage of an 8% tax on high calorie snacks, which was intended to work in tandem with the 2014 soda tax to reduce unhealthy food purchases nationwide.[45]  In June 2015, a study by researchers at Mexico’s National Institute of Public Health and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill showed a corresponding average reduction of 5.1% in purchases of all food items subject to the junk food tax.[46] Following the tax’s implementation, lower-income households in Mexico purchased 10.2% less junk food, while medium-income households bought 5.8% less overall.[47]
 On March 23, 2015, Bloomberg Philanthropies launched the four-year, $100 million Data for Health initiative in partnership with the Australian government.

Born This Way Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_This_Way_Foundation	"The Born This Way Foundation (BTWF) is an American non-profit organization founded in 2011 by singer Lady Gaga and her mother Cynthia Germanotta. Established at Harvard University, and named after Gaga's third studio album Born This Way (2011), the foundation aims to inspire youth and build better communities. BTWF works in partnership with the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and The California Endowment.[3]
 The foundation aims to create a ""braver, kinder world"" for youths; create safe-spaces, promote the learning of life skills, and provide opportunities to improve their local communities.[4] In a statement, Lady Gaga said ""My mother and I have initiated a passion project [...] to establish a standard of bravery and kindness, as well as a community worldwide that protects and nurtures others in the face of bullying and abandonment.""[5]
 In September 2012 Gaga was awarded the LennonOno Grant For Peace from Yoko Ono for her work with the foundation ""actively campaigning on pro-tolerance and peace issues.""[6][7]  The award ""intends to keep that pop activism alive"" in the spirit of Ono and her late husband John Lennon whose song ""Imagine"" includes the famous line ""imagine all the people living life in peace.""[6]
 Lady Gaga was always interested in the subject of bullying and the empowerment of young people.[8] In 2011, Gaga met with U.S. President Barack Obama to talk on the subject.[5] Her meeting was in part response to gay fourteen-year-old Jamey Rodemeyer, who killed himself because he was being bullied.[5][9][10]  He had recorded an ""It Gets Better"" video and before he died posted a line from a Lady Gaga song on his Facebook page.[5] In 2010, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network stated, ""There has been heightened media attention surrounding the [recent] suicides.""[11] The same month, Tyler Clementi died, four other LGBT teenagers were reported to have committed suicide  after being bullied about their homosexuality.[12]
 The Guardian noted as well Gaga's interest in the ""history of devastating school shootings perpetrated by students felt to be social outcasts,"" they wrote:
 [Gaga is] recognising that schools are powerful places to spark societal change, she hopes her message will ""inject love, acceptance and tolerance into culture."" At the end of the day, the goal is not only to ""save the victim,"" she says, ""but also save the bully.""[13]
 In the documentary Inside the Outside, Gaga told of being bullied herself and thrown in a trashcan while classmates looked on.[14]
 The organization was launched on February 29, 2012 by artist Lady Gaga and her mother Cynthia Germanotta, who said, ""challenge meanness and cruelty by inspiring young people to create a support system in their respective communities.""[15][16][17] Media proprietor Oprah Winfrey, writer Deepak Chopra, and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius spoke at the inauguration.[18][19] The Foundation's original funding included $1.2 million from Gaga, $500,000 from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and $850,000 from retailer Barneys New York.[20]
 The BTWF was the beneficiary of Barneys New York's 2011 holiday campaign which also featured ""Lady Gaga’s Workshop.""[21] In May 2012, Viacom announced it would be the foundation's lead media partner for the development of events, programming and ""opportunities that empower young people to build a braver, kinder world.""[22][23]  In August 2012, Gaga was named by American business magazine Forbes, well known for its lists (richest Americans – the Forbes 400, Forbes list of billionaires, etc.), as fourteenth on their ""World's 100 Most Powerful Women"" list due in part to her BTWF work.[24]
 In March 2014, Roger Friedman of Showbiz411 criticized the foundation's spendings after its federal tax reports were released. The reports noted spending of $348,000 on its Born Brave Bus tour; approximately $1.5 million on fees related to Web and social media, publicity, and legalities, as opposed to only $5,000 in grants to individuals and other organizations. ""It’s unclear that anyone was really helped by the Born This Way Foundation other than lawyers, consultants, publicists and travel agents,"" Friedman wrote.[25] ""We do the work,"" Lady Gaga wrote in response. ""We do not raise money and allocate the funds to other charities for them to do the work.""[26] ""A clear understanding of the differences between a grant-making organization and one that carries out its work directly would have made this a non-story,"" Cynthia Germanotta added. ""We are not a grant-maker that funds the work of other charities, and were never intended to be ... [But] we are having a profound impact in just a very short period of time.""[26]
 From March 28 to April 11, 2012, the BTWF ran a poster campaign ""to inspire bravery"" and encouraging supporters to submit images that answer the question ""What does bravery mean to you?"" with the 10 semifinalists selected by Gaga and her mother and leading to a prize for the winner(s), selected by fans.[27][28]
 In August 2012, BTWF Co-founder Cynthia Germanotta was one of the speakers at the U.S. Department of Education's third annual Federal Partners in Bullying Prevention Summit to coordinate ""anti-bullying efforts with the best available research,""[29] she appeared with White House senior advisor Valerie Jarrett with their speeches broadcast on C-SPAN.[30][31]  BTWF's work was discussed among other ongoing anti-bullying efforts.[29]
 In October 2014, the Connecticut Commission on Children held a Summit on Youth, Civics, and Positive School climate, co-sponsored by the BTWF, the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, the Connecticut Department of Education, the Anti-Defamation League, and the UConn NEAG School of Education.[32]  The Summit consisted of legislators and high school students from around the state, who shared their experiences with bullying and harassment, including an opening performance by high school freshman Nina Lee, whose anti-bullying song and video, entitled ""Try to Break Me,"" had caught the attention of State Senator Danté Bartolomeo, and culminated in a keynote address by Cynthia Germanotta on behalf of the BTWF.[32]  The BTWF's work with the Connecticut Commission on Children and the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence continued thereafter, leading to the Emotion Revolution Survey and Summit.[33][34]
 In October 2012 the formalization of a seven-person Research and Advisory Board was announced that will advise on BTWF's ""youth empowerment and tolerance programs"" based on ""sound theory and research.""[35][36]  Susan Swearer, University of Nebraska-Lincoln professor of school psychology in the College of Education and Human Sciences, will chair the group.[35] Swearer has worked with BTWF since 2011 creating resources ""as it prepared to enter the national anti-bullying discussion,"" she co-directs the Bullying Research Network, which ""promotes international collaboration among bullying and peer victimization researchers.""[35] Also named to the board is  C.J. Pascoe, the only sociologist, from Colorado College who studies gender, sexuality, inequality, youth and new media.[36]
 Gaga announced in May 2012 that the ""Born Brave Bus"" would follow her on tour as a youth drop-in center as an initiative against bullying and homophobia.[37][38][39] In June 2012, ""Born Brave"" community and school groups, these localized groups dedicate to making positive change where they live.[40] Born Brave Nation, a name chosen by the BTWF supporters, was requesting founding members in July 2012 but had not yet launched. The Born Brave Nation would later be headed by youths ""dedicated to building a kinder, braver world in their homes, schools, and communities"" and appears to accept anyone only up to the age of 100 years as a founder, teacher, student or supporter.[41]
 In August 2012 the BTWF launched a national youth advisory board, 24 young people ages 17–23 who will represent other young people.[39] They initially attended a three-day summit at Paramount Pictures in Los Angeles,[39] where they held discussions with youth advocate and journalist Anne Collier, and Maya Enista Smith, the CEO of Mobilize.org.[42][43]  During the summit the board provided feedback on upcoming programs and initiatives of the BTWF, ""helping to guide the Foundation’s plan for the coming year.""[42] The youth advisory board will serve as ambassadors to ""Born Brave Nation.""[42]
 In 2012, Gaga expressed an interest in being part of the ""natural fabric of schooling.""[44] In July 2012, the BTWF partnered with supplier of office products Office Depot to create a range of limited edition back-to-school products including: ""empowerment gift cards"" containing motivational messages, and ""bravery bracelets.""[45]  Office Depot agreed to donate 25% of the sale value for each item sold and guaranteed $1 million USD donation in 2012 to the foundation.[46] This led the Florida Family Association, what New York Times noted was a one-man Christian fundamentalist organization,
to accuse Office Depot of influencing teenagers to become gay.[5][47][48] In support of the efforts by Office Depot and the Born This Way Foundation, public service announcement videos were created by model and actor Patrick Schwarzenegger,[49] and by pop singer Greyson Chance to be aired on Facebook, YouTube and other outlets.[50]
 In September 2012 Gaga launched a new project called A Body Revolution 2013 to address poor body image and body acceptance, this was done, in part, because media outlets had negatively remarked on supposed weight gains by the performer.[51] To start the project she posted images of herself in underwear and asked others to follow her lead stating ""May we make our flaws famous, and thus redefine the heinous.""[52] She accompanied the photos with statements that she suffered from the eating disorders bulimia and anorexia nervosa since she was 15.[53]
 On July 24, 2013 the BTWF announced a Crowdrise campaign with the stated goal of crowdsourcing the process of raising money to continue the Born Brave Bus tour.[54] On January 7, 2016, at the CES 2016, it was announced that the foundation partnered with Intel, Vox Media and Re/code to fight online harassment to provide a safer online experience.[55]
 On October 16, 2016 toy company Mattel released the Zomby Gaga collector doll for pre-order as a part of their Monster High doll line in partnership with the BTWF.[56] The doll is based on Gaga's Zombie Boy inspired skeleton tattoo make up and tuxedo look from the Born This Way music video and designed by Gaga's sister Natali Germanotta together with Mattel. The doll was released on Jan 2, 2017 with all proceeds benefitting the foundation.
 On October 21, 2017 during the benefit concert held at Texas A&M University in College Station at the precence of all five living former U.S. Presidents, Lady Gaga said that the Born This Way Foundation would be involved with One America Appeal to start a ""mental health and emotional trauma surviving program"" for people hit by the Hurricane disasters.[57]"

 The first Boys' Club was founded in 1860 in Hartford, Connecticut, by three women, Elizabeth Hamersley and sisters Mary and Alice Goodwin.[4] In 1906, 53 independent Boys' Clubs came together in Boston to form a national organization, the Federated Boys' Clubs. In 1931, the organization renamed itself Boys' Clubs of America, and in 1990, to Boys & Girls Clubs of America. As of 2010, there are over 4,000 autonomous local clubs, which are affiliates of the national organization. In total these clubs serve more than four million boys and girls. Clubs can be found in all 50 states as well as locations in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and US military bases. In total, Boys & Girls Clubs of America employ about 50,000 staff members.[5]
 The Chronicle of Philanthropy ranked Boys & Girls Clubs of America number one among youth organizations for the 13th consecutive year, and number 12 among all nonprofit organizations. The Boys & Girls Clubs of America is the official charity of Major League Baseball.[6] Denzel Washington, a former club member, has been the spokesperson for Boys & Girls Clubs of America since 1993.
 These people came together in 1956 to create the Boys Clubs of America:[7]
 In 1990, Boys Clubs of America was succeeded by Boys & Girls Clubs of America, which was founded by the following people:

It will also help in establishing new STEM centers of innovations in various communities that will include Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, New York City's Harlem, Hartford, Memphis, New Orleans, Orlando, Philadelphia, Washington, Watts in Los Angeles, and Oakland.[12]
 According to Mimi LeClair, President and CEO of Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, it is very important for young people to have a solid background in STEM to compete in the global economy.[13]"
Bread for the World	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_for_the_World	"Bread for the World is a non-partisan, Christian citizens' movement in the United States to end hunger. The organization describes itself as a collective Christian voice urging decision makers to end hunger in the United States and around the world. Bread equips people to write personal letters and emails, meet with their members of Congress, and to work with others to change policies, programs, and conditions that allow hunger and poverty to persist.
 In October 1972, a small group of Catholics and Protestants met to reflect on how persons of faith could be mobilized to influence U.S. policies that address the causes of hunger. Under the leadership of the Reverend Arthur Simon, the group began to test the idea in the spring of 1974. By year's end, more than 500 people had joined the ranks of Bread for the World as citizen advocates for hungry people. 
 In September 1991, Rev. David Beckmann succeeded Simon as president.[1]
 Bread for the World is a founding member of The ONE Campaign—a movement to rally Americans to end extreme poverty and preventable disease, particularly in Africa. 
 Each year, Bread for the World invites churches across the country to take up a nationwide Offering of Letters to Congress on an issue that is important to people experiencing hunger. Since 1974 the Offering of Letters campaign has focused on a different hunger issue each year; 2007's campaign, for example, aimed to provoke the reform of the U.S. Farm Bill. Bread for the World's 2019 Offering of Letters campaign urges Congress to increase funding for global nutrition programs.

All service packages are adapted to the conditions and requirements of the individual country and are supported by an adequate quality management system (QMS).
 In February 2009 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between BORDA and the Department of Water and Sanitation of the eThekwini Municipality (EWS) in the province KwaZulu Natal, South Africa for a demonstration and research DEWATS plant to be designed, constructed, commissioned and operated at Newlands-Mashu, Durban. In October 2010 the biogas settler and the anaerobic baffled reactors (ABR) were seeded with biomass.
 In June 2010 EWS, HERING South Africa, the Pollution Research Group (PRG) of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) and BORDA agreed to co-operate to achieve transfer of technology and know-how transfer for planning, installation and operation of prefabricated community ablution blocks (CABs) to offer improved sanitation services to communities. Based on this Public-Private-Partnership-Project BORDA SADC established a new office in Shakas Head, in the north of Durban. The premises are shared with HERING South Africa.
 BORDA has worked in India since 1979, making it the oldest region to be served by the organization. Programs implemented span the range of BORDA services, from Decentralized Wastewater Treatment (DEWATS) to Decentralized Energy Supplies.
 Currently, BORDA - South Asia (BORDA-SA) works in nine Indian states, as well as neighboring regions. In Nepal BORDA co-operates with ENPHO. BORDA-SA and its partners have been contracted by international development organizations, including GIZ (Germany, in particular with the formerly GTZ and InWent), AusAid (Australia), and CEU, as well as national and local governments.
 BORDA-SA supports a development cooperation network of 13 partner organizations, and by extension over 100 development experts in providing basic needs services. Over 110 DEWATS projects have been implemented, together with more than 65 Decentralized Energy Supplies and 60 Water Supplies.
 The main emphasis of BORDA SEA is DEWATS, in particular DEWATS CBS, SME's and the establishment of community-based organisations to provide sustainable operation and maintenance of the facilities. For upscaling the DESWAM (decentralized solid waste management for low income urban communities) service package BORDA SEA develops in co-operation with IDRC (International Research Development Centre) a pro poor carbon financing scheme under the Kyoto protocol.
 In Indonesia, BORDA strongly emphasis on the enhancement of DESWAM as well as continuing the national program of community-based sanitation (SANIMAS) through the dissemination of DEWATS. Best practices are transferred into technical and social implementation standard as well as improving the involved human resources capacity through trainings and certification. The working group on Indonesian's national policy on water supply and sanitation is co-operating with BORDA and its local NGO partners as the main supporting network for community-based sanitation (CBS) with more than 500 implementations - including school-based sanitation and 14 DESWAM until the end of 2010. Local NGO partners are Balifokus, LPTP (Lembaga Pengembangan Teknologi Pedesaan - Center for Community-Based Environmental Technology) and B.E.S.T.
 In the Philippines, BORDA is co-operating with BNS Philippines to introduce DEWATS as a viable option for waste water and environmental health problems in urban areas. Transferring know-how was conducted by Indonesian experts within the context of the BORDA south-south dissemination program. By now, BNS is a well known service provider for DEWATS in the Philippines.
In Cambodia, specialists on DEWATS from Indonesia have been facilitated by BORDA and its partner organization ESC (Environmental Services Cambodia) to support in enhancing its capacity concerning DEWATS know-how. 3 DEWATS plants were inaugurated in 2010. Cooperations with national and international stakeholders will allow a start up of DEWATS as an application for waste water management in Cambodia mainly for communities, schools and hospitals.
 In Vietnam, the BORDA maintains a branch office. Indonesian specialists support the capacity building at the Vietnam Partners at Vietnam Institute for Water Resources concerning DEWATS applications. In earlier years the  Organization implemented the Hydraulic Ram (HydRam) technology as well as the use of biogas, energy-saving stoves, and solar panels, supported the introduction of HPC's turbine pumps and Decentralized Waste Water Treatment System (DEWATS) technology.
 In Laos, BORDA opened a project office in February, 2013, to implement DEWATS Service Packages in one of Southeast Asia's least developed countries. Institutional cooperation takes place at national and local level, particularly with the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, Department of Housing and Urban Planning, to promote both improved public health within low income urban and peri-urban settlements, and the reduction organic pollution of precious fresh water sources for the benefit of the Lao people and nation.
 Under the project title “Capacity building for local craftsmen and small medium enterprises for the sustainable implementation of Decentraliesed wastewater treatment systems (DEWATS)"", BORDA runs project offices in Kabul and Herat since July 2012 with projects focused on vocational training.
Many years of civil war and military intervention have brought about a massive destruction of infrastructure and the loss of capacities for civil reconstruction in Afghanistan. The current growth of the country‘s urban centres intensifies the need for feasible waste disposal solutions and increases the demand for trained staff in the water, sanitation and hygiene sector. 
BORDA Afghanistan promotes DEWATS through training programs and learning projects. An emphasis is given to glass-fibre reinforced plastic (GRFP) technologies, which reduce the risk and cost of implementation. BORDA provides also School-Based Sanitation (SBS), Health & Hygiene Education (HE) and Health Impact Assessments (HIA) in Afghanistan. So far, such services have been deployed for Schools, Hospitals and Mosques in the provinces Kabul, Bamyian, Balkh, Badakshan, Herat, and Nangahar. The objective of current projects is also the dissemination of Biogas technologies in cooperation with local partner organisations.
In order to achieve sustainable coherent development, BORDA Afghanistan coordinates closely with national institutions such as the Ministry of Urban Development Affairs and the Environmental Protection Agency. For the vocational training of Afghan craftsmen and small-scale entrepreneurs BORDA cooperates with its local partners."
British Heart Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Heart_Foundation	"The British Heart Foundation (BHF) is a charity organisation in the United Kingdom. It funds research to beat heartbreak from heart and circulatory diseases and their risk factors.
 The British Heart Foundation was founded in 1961 by a group of medical professionals, who were concerned about the increasing death rate from cardiovascular disease. They wanted to fund extra research into the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of heart and circulatory diseases.[1]
 It is a major funder and authority in cardiovascular research, education, and care, and relies predominantly on voluntary donations to meet its aims. In order to increase income and maximise the impact of its work, it also works with other organizations to combat premature death and disability from cardiovascular disease.
 The British Heart Foundation’s main focus is to fund cardiovascular research, aiming to spend around £100 million a year funding scientists around the UK. They are currently funding over 1000 research projects.[2]
 Since 2008 the British Heart Foundation has been investing in Centres of Research Excellence. The six current centres bring together scientists from a number of disciplines to work on research projects to beat heart and circulatory disease.[3]
The current Centres of Research are:
 In 2013 the BHF committed to funding three multi-institution Centres of Regenerative Medicine, investing £7.5 million over four years to fund scientists looking for new treatments for heart failure.[4]
 Other activities include:
 In 2015 The British Heart Foundation had an income of just over £133m. In 2015 the BHF spent £102.5 million on funding cardiovascular research and £30.8 million on prevention, survival and support activities.[7]
 The British Heart Foundation sponsored two television series produced by Twofour, Kitchen Detective and Kid's Fit Squad. Both series encouraged healthy eating and exercise with practical advice for families, and aired on the Discovery Health channel. The BHF, along with Cancer Research UK, is a major backer of the anti-tobacco campaign group Action on Smoking and Health.[8]
 The BHF is mainly funded by legacies and wills, accounting for 40% of their income, the rest is made up of other voluntary income (31%), profit from the retail division (23%) and investment income (5%).
 The charity organises a sponsored skipping challenge through schools, Jump Ropae for Heart, in which the participating schools are entitled to retain 20% of the money raised.[12]
 Other annual campaigns include National Heart Month (held throughout February), Wear Red Day and The Big Donation as well as many other campaigns to recruit volunteers, raise awareness of BHF, sell stock and increase donations.
 In December 2010 Victoria Wood performed a show called ""The Angina Monologues"" for The British Heart Foundation with the strapline ""Beating Heart Disease one laugh at a time"".[13]
 The British Heart Foundation Shops Division was founded in 1986, and was renamed Retail Division in 2010. The BHF run a large chain of charity shops throughout England, Wales and Scotland, as of December 2016 they run 737 shops which include over 160 furniture and electrical shops (or F+E shops), and they are looking to acquire more sites in the coming years. They also have an online shop and an eBay Store. The BHF Retail division makes roughly £30 million every year.[14]
 BHF shops are predominantly staffed by roughly 22,500 volunteers and each shop also has a paid staff made up of a shop manager, assistant manager and may also have a shop assistant.
 The British Heart Foundation were the first charity shops to Gift Aid their donations to get extra money by claiming the tax back from the donor.[citation needed]
 The Retail Director is Mike Taylor and the headquarters of the retail division is based in Claygate, England. The BHF has 730 shops across the UK.
 The charity is one of four organisations subject to a national boycott campaign regarding their funding of animal research. ""Animal Aid plans to take out a series of newspaper adverts urging the public to stop giving money to Cancer Research UK, the British Heart Foundation, the Alzheimer's Society and Parkinson's UK unless they end their support for animal testing.""[15][16] In November 2011 a protest took place calling for the BHF and the University of Leeds to stop carrying out co-funded ""lethal experiments"" on dogs. The pressure group Animal Aid stated that 100 dogs had died since 1988 during the experiments.[17][18]
 The BHF has responded to these criticisms by saying the charity only funds animal research after grant applications have gone through an independent peer review process and follows the three Rs principles when considering such grants.[19]
 On 6 December 2016, the BHF was fined £18,000 by the UK Information Commissioner's Office which ruled that the charity had breached data protection legislation by employing external bodies to analyse the financial status of supporters in order to appeal to them for further donations, a practice known as 'wealth screening', and by trading the personal details of its donors with other charitable organisations.[20] The BBC reported that, ""Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said donors had not been informed of the charity's practices, and were therefore unable to consent or object to them. She also suggested other charities could also be engaged in similar activities. 'The millions of people who give their time and money to benefit good causes will be saddened to learn that their generosity wasn't enough,' Ms Denham added.""[20] The same BBC report noted that the charity's chief executive had stated that ""the ICO's conclusions were 'wrong, disproportionate and inconsistent […] We find the decision surprising, as earlier this year in June the ICO praised our data handling. Our trustees will therefore consider whether it's in the interests of our supporters and beneficiaries to challenge this decision.""[20]"
Burroughs Wellcome Fund	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burroughs_Wellcome_Fund	"The Burroughs Wellcome Fund (BWF) is a private, independent biomedical research foundation based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.[1]  BWF was founded in 1955 as the corporate foundation of the Burroughs Wellcome Co., the U.S. branch of the Wellcome pharmaceutical enterprise, based in the United Kingdom. In 1993, a $400 million gift from the Wellcome Trust enabled BWF to become fully independent from the company, which was acquired by Glaxo in 1995 and is now known by the moniker GlaxoSmithKline.[2]
 BWF is one of the most significant funders of biomedical research. Its overall goal is to help scientists early in their careers develop as independent investigators, and to advance fields in the basic medical sciences that are undervalued or in need of particular encouragement.[3] Additionally, BWF has invested $3 million annually to support hands-on science education programs for primary and secondary students in North Carolina.[4] According to its annual report,[5] BWF had $720 million in total assets and made $28.4 million in grants in 2013.
 The Burroughs Wellcome Fund, founded in the United States in 1955, has roots in 19th-century England, where in 1880 two American pharmacists, Silas Burroughs and Henry Wellcome, formed Burroughs Wellcome and Co. to develop “compressed” medicines or pills for delivering standardized, reproducible dosages that could be safer and more effective than the common potions and powders of the day.[6] After Silas Burroughs died in 1895, Henry Wellcome expanded the company into several continents and numerous countries, including the United States. 
 In 1924, Wellcome consolidated all of the company's holdings under a corporate umbrella that he named The Wellcome Foundation Ltd. In recognition of his contributions to international science, Wellcome received a knighthood in 1932 by King George V. When Sir Henry died in 1936, his will called for vesting all of the corporate shares in a new entity – the Wellcome Trust. The Trust's charge was to devote all of its income to research in medicine and allied science and to the maintenance of research museums and libraries dedicated to these fields. Over the decades, the Trust has supported a vast array of biomedical research in the United Kingdom and other selected regions of the globe, becoming the world's largest charitable foundation devoted exclusively to the biomedical sciences. 
 In 1955, Sir Henry Dale, one of the Trust's original trustees and its chair for 21 years, and William N. Creasy, president and chair of Burroughs Wellcome Co.-USA, created a U.S. extension of the Wellcome Trust that they called the Burroughs Wellcome Fund. For nearly 40 years as a corporate foundation, BWF focused its modest financial resources in selected areas to advance scientific knowledge.
 In 1993, BWF received a $400 million gift from the Wellcome Trust that enabled it to become a completely independent foundation, with no direct ties to its funding company. The stated mission of BWF is to advance the medical sciences by supporting research and other scientific and educational activities. Aided by the Trust's gift, BWF now pursues an enhanced role in biomedical research in the United States and has expanded its support to include Canada. Today, BWF seeks to accomplish two primary goals through its programs:  to help outstanding scientists early in their careers develop as independent investigators, and to advance fields in the basic medical sciences that are undervalued or in need of particular encouragement.[7]
 A number of individuals were responsible for instilling the Wellcome legacy in the Burroughs Wellcome Fund. William Creasy remained at BWF's helm for more than a decade, guiding development of the Fund's mission and scientific activities. William Dowling, who had developed the legal structure of the Fund, served as its chair from 1971 until 1974. George Hitchings, Ph.D., a Nobel laureate who spent most of his career with Burroughs Wellcome Co., served as BWF's president from 1974 until 1990, and his leadership strongly reinforced the Fund's belief in the essential link between basic research and practical applications in medicine. Howard Schaeffer, Ph.D., a pioneering chemist who chaired BWF from 1991 until 1994, played a significant role in helping the Wellcome Trust carry outs its gift to the Fund.[8]"

Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calouste_Gulbenkian_Foundation	"The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation (Portuguese: Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian), commonly referred to simply as the Gulbenkian Foundation, is a Portuguese institution dedicated to the promotion of the arts, philanthropy, science, and education. One of the wealthiest charitable foundations in the world, the Gulbenkian Foundation was founded on 18 July 1956 according to the last will and testament of Calouste Sarkis Gulbenkian, a Portugal-based oil magnate who bequeathed his assets to the country in the form of a foundation.
 The oil magnate had one of the largest private art collections in Europe, which is housed in the foundation's Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon. The foundation hosts numerous institutions and initiatives including the Gulbenkian Orchestra, Gulbenkian Science Institute, Gulbenkian Prizes and the Gulbenkian Commission.
 Located in Lisbon (civil parish of Avenidas Novas), the Foundation’s premises opened in 1969 and were designed by Ruy Athouguia, Pedro Cid, and Alberto Pessoa. In addition to Foundation offices, the complex includes an auditorium, exhibition space, congress facilities, and a large building designed specifically to house and display Museum and art library. These are set in Gulbenkian Park, which was designed by Ribeiro Telles. In 1983, the Modern Art Centre was added at one end of the park. 
 The Calouste Gulbenkian Museum (Portuguese: Museu Calouste Gulbenkian), founded in conformity with his last will and testament, accommodates his collection of mostly ancient and classical art, but including some individual modern pieces.
 The Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC, a science institute) is not situated on the same premises but its own complex in Oeiras (outskirts of Lisbon), near the palace of the Marquis of Pombal. The institute is an international centre for biological and biomedical research and graduate training. Founded in 1961, the IGC is organised in small independent research groups that work in an environment designed to encourage interactions with minimal hierarchical structure. The scientific programme is multidisciplinary, including Cell and Developmental biology, Evolutionary biology, Immunology, Host-pathogen interaction, Disease Genetics, Plant Biology, Neurosciences, Theoretical and Computational biology.
 The Gulbenkian Orchestra (Portuguese: Orquestra Gulbenkian) is a Portuguese symphony orchestra based in Lisbon. The orchestra primarily gives concerts at the Grande Auditório (Grand Auditorium) of the fhe Foundation’s main premises. Established in 1962 as the Orquestra de Câmara Gulbenkian (Gulbenkian Chamber Orchestra) with 12 musicians, it has subsequently expanded in size and took on its current name in 1971.
 Gulbenkian ballet was a Portuguese classical dance troupe created in 1965 by the Foundation as Centro Português do Bailado. Its programme directors were Walter Gore (1965–1969), Milko Sparembeck (1969–1975), Jorge Salavisa (1977–1996), Iracity Cardoso (1996–2003) and Paulo Ribeiro (2003–2005). The project was terminated in 2005.
 Gulbenkian Choir (Portuguese: Coro Gulbenkian) is a musical choir project established by the Foundation in 1964 as the Gulbenkian Chamber Choir (Coro de Câmara Gulbenkian) directed by Olga Violante (1964–1969). Since then the choir made up of an average 100 members is directed by Michel Corboz.
 The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation also has a delegation in the United Kingdom (UK Branch) and a centre in Paris (the Calouste Gulbenkian Cultural Centre). The Foundation's Armenian Communities Department has a unique and separate long-running mission in aiding Armenia and Diasporan Armenian projects.
 The foundation publishes books on a range of topics, including arts, education and languages.
 Partex, a Portuguese oil extraction company, is fully owned by the Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian. It is a member of the Network of European Foundations for Innovative Cooperation (NEF).[2]  The mission statement[3] of the UK Branch desires to change perceptions, build relationships, reduce social exclusion and preserve the environment and innovative partnerships.
 The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation is very active in the Armenian community worldwide as its founder Calouste Gulbenkian was of Armenian ethnicity. The Foundation has its Armenian Communities Department headed by Razmik Panossian. The Foundation's Armenian Communities Department distributes scholarships in the form of grants and bourses to Armenian students worldwide pursuing their education all over the world. The Foundation is active in Armenia and throughout the Armenian diaspora. It also supports actively in promotion and preservation of the Armenian language, in particular Western Armenian used mostly by the Armenian diaspora, support of Armenian schools throughout the world, as well as Armenian societies, history, culture, churches, media, sports etc.[4][5]
 The Gulbenkian Commission sought to address inadequacies in the organization of the social science disciplines that developed in the nineteenth century by indicating a direction for social scientific inquiry for the next 50 years. It was founded by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. It held three meetings in 1994 and 1995.

Campaign for Liberty	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_for_Liberty	"The Campaign for Liberty (C4L) is a political organization founded by twelve-term United States Congressman Ron Paul. Campaign for Liberty focuses on educating elected officials and the general public about constitutional issues, and currently provides a membership program. Its legal status is that of a 501(c)(4) nonprofit.
 The Campaign for Liberty was announced on June 12, 2008 as a way of continuing the grassroots support involved in Ron Paul's 2008 presidential run, and corresponded with the suspension of that campaign.[citation needed] Paul formally announced during the Texas Republican Convention that he had created this new organization known as the ""Campaign for Liberty"".
 On August 5, 2015, C4L Chairman John Tate was indicted by a federal grand jury for felony charges arising from an alleged cover-up Tate, and colleagues on the 2012 Ron Paul presidential campaign, conducted to conceal the expenditure of campaign money to buy the endorsement of an Iowa politician.[2] In October 2015, Tate was acquitted of all charges.[3]
 According to Ron Paul, the purpose of the Campaign for Liberty is to continue the principles that invoked the grassroots support of his campaign, and to also be able to continue the message that he promoted during the course of his bid, without having a presidential campaign, and is also intended to ""lay the groundwork for a different America."" Paul also noted,[4]
 The time has come to act on these words. May future generations look back on our work and say that these were men and women who, in a moment of great crisis, stood up to the politicians, the opinion-molders, and the establishment, and saved their country.
 It was also established as a reporting agency for news involved with the principles of the organization.
 Campaign for Liberty's first major policy initiative involves pushing support for HR 1207, a bill that calls for more transparency of the Federal Reserve. Also called the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009, HR 1207 was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives of the 111th United States Congress by Campaign For Liberty's Honorary Chairman, Congressman Ron Paul (TX-14). The bill proposed a full audit of the Federal Reserve System (the ""Fed"") before the end of 2010. As of May 25, 2010, it had 319 cosponsors and has been referred to the Committee on Financial Services.
 The bill was reintroduced in the 112th Congress by Congressman Ron Paul. The Federal Reserve Transparency Act passed the House of Representatives on July 25, 2012 by a margin of 327-98. At the time of passage, the bill had 274 co-sponsors. Harry Reid refused to bring the Senate version, S.202, introduced by Senator Rand Paul, up for a vote.
 H.R 24, ""Ron Paul's Audit the Fed"" was introduced in the House on January 3, 2013 by Congressman Paul Broun of Georgia. As of April 15, 2013, the bill has 142 co-sponsors. An identical bill, S.209, was introduced in the Senate by Senator Rand Paul. As of April 15, 2013, the bill has 24 co-sponsors.
 Campaign for Liberty has lobbied against CISPA and SOPA/PIPA.[5]  Campaign for Liberty is opposed to the Marketplace Fairness Act and has urged its members to lobby against it.[6]
 The Liberty Political Action Conference (LPAC) is a conference held by Campaign for Liberty once a year. At the event, Campaign for Liberty trains its members with the newest campaign and political activism techniques.
 On June 10, 2008 the Ron Paul Campaign announced the first promotional event for the organization, a ""Rally for the Republic"". After not being offered a speaking slot at the Republican convention, Ron Paul, who did not support GOP nominee John McCain, decided to stage his own parallel convention in Minneapolis.[7] This event occurred at the Target Center on September 2, 2008, which was the second day of the GOP Convention.[8] On July 22, 2008, the event's official website launched, which provided details of the Rally, and of other events which were to occur in the same week including a leadership summit, book signing, and free concert. Notable attendees were announced, including the Rally's emcee, MSNBC's Tucker Carlson, former Governor Jesse Ventura, Governor Gary Johnson, Barry Goldwater Jr., Bruce Fein, Howard Phillips, Thomas Woods, Bill Kauffman, Erik Vendt, Grover Norquist, Lew Rockwell, Barb Davis White and Doug Wead. Country music star Sara Evans and singer/songwriter Aimee Allen headlined the musical portion of the event.[9] On September 1, more than 10,000 tickets were sold out.[10] Most of the rally was broadcast live on C-SPAN 2 and a live stream was set up on the Campaign for Liberty website.
 According to the Rally's official website, its purpose was to ""be a celebration of our movement and our supporters, a launch party for the Campaign for Liberty, and a clear call to the Republican Party to return to its roots of limited government, personal responsibility, and protection of our natural rights. The event ran in conjunction with the first two days of the Republican National Convention and featured top conservative speakers, musicians, and organizations. It also had an organizational and training function for the Campaign for Liberty and the Freedom Movement."" Much of the press of the event referred to the rally as a ""counter-convention"".[11]
 On October 26, 2008, Don Rasmussen, the former Director of Operations for Campaign for Liberty said the organization was planning a series of regional summits throughout 2009. Matt Hawes, Vice President of Programs, later announced that the C4L would hold these events throughout the country.
 The first of these regional conferences was held on March 27–29, 2009, in St. Louis, Missouri. Ron Paul, Judge Andrew Napolitano, and staff members from C4L and Young Americans for Liberty spoke. Other activities included grassroots training sessions in addition to a lecture by historian and author Thomas E. Woods, Jr..
 Campaign for Liberty held another conference on May 22–24, 2009 at the Doubletree Hotel in Seattle, Washington.
 On July 10–12, 2009 Campaign for Liberty members gathered at Bally's in Las Vegas, Nevada, for the next regional conference where they were able to ""network, learn, and build their local organizations as our grassroots Revolution to reclaim our Republic and restore our Constitution continues."" This event ran in conjunction with the annual Freedom Fest which features over 100 libertarian-minded speakers. Thomas E. Woods, Jr. and Ron Paul were joined by economist Mark Skousen for the C4L event.
 On September 17–19, C4L held its next regional conference right outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the Valley Forge Convention Center. This event included two rallies, each attended by several hundred activists. On opening night, the ""Freedom Celebration"" featured Dr. Ron Paul, the American Conservative Defense Alliance's Phil Giraldi, New Jersey State Assemblyman Mike Doherty, and Ron Paul's son and C4L board member, Ronnie Paul. On Friday, attendees received political training, and then Judge Andrew Napolitano delivered speech about the problems with the PATRIOT Act. The conference concluded on Saturday with an ""Economic Liberty Symposium"", which featured author Thomas E. Woods, Jr., broker and Senate Candidate Peter Schiff, and British MEP Daniel Hannan.
 C4L held the next regional conference in Atlanta, GA on January 15–17, 2010. It was held at the Sheraton in Atlanta and brought supporters from Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, and many more states. Speakers included Congressman Ron Paul, Thomas E. Woods, Jr., Lew Rockwell, and Thomas DiLorenzo.

The Canadian International Learning Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_International_Learning_Foundation	"The Canadian International Learning Foundation (CanILF) is an Ottawa, Ontario, Canada-based, volunteer-run registered charity which provides and promotes professional education in areas of the world affected by war, illness and poverty (at-risk areas).[1]
 CanILF seeks to reach its goals through the following activities:
 The Afghan-Canadian Community Center (ACCC),[2] is a safe and secure place for women to receive an education.[3]  The ACCC provides courses in Business Management, IT, English and Health Care to approximately 1,500 women and men. Students at the ACCC also receive recognized Canadian online education via the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology and the Canada e-School. The ACCC’s programs provide the skills its students need to obtain employment at a cost-per-student from $10 to $25 per month.[4] Once employed, students support themselves and their families (on average, 6 family members per student), give back to their communities and participate in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.  Because of ACCC training, more than 500 students have obtained employment or promotions.
 The school presently receives more than half of its operating expenses through the Kandahar Capacity Project, which is funded by the Canadian International Development Agency’s Kandahar Local Initiatives Program.[5]
 CanILF also operates a project to benefit the Community Empowerment Program at St. Paul’s Kabira Adult Attention and School of Orphans (KAASO)[6] via its Uganda Literacy and Education Program.[7]  The Community Empowerment Program provides women and men in the community with education in basic literacy, business, agriculture and traditional artisanry.
 The Yemen Micro-Project (YMP) is The Canadian International Learning Foundation’s first project in the Middle East.[8]  The YMP’s goal is to help to connect local partners in Yemen with educational and information technology expertise in Canada through collaborative initiatives.  Canada Bridges,[9] an organization that has extensive experience in offering business education in Yemen, has agreed to help CanILF choose suitable partners and establish relationships with the Government of Yemen.
 Members of the Foundation in Ottawa meet in The Glebe on a weekly basis.[10]
 A group of approximately 30 students at the Afghan-Canadian Community Center (ACCC) are currently studying Business Management via online courses taught online by the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT).

Cancer Research UK	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Research_UK	"Cancer Research UK is a cancer research and awareness charity in the United Kingdom[1] and Isle of Man, formed on 4 February 2002 by the merger of The Cancer Research Campaign and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund.[2] Its aim is to reduce the number of deaths from cancer. As the world's largest independent cancer research charity[3][4] it conducts research into the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Research activities are carried out in institutes, universities and hospitals across the UK, both by the charity's own employees and by its grant-funded researchers. It also provides information about cancer and runs campaigns aimed at raising awareness of the disease and influencing public policy.[5][6][7]
 Cancer Research UK's work is almost entirely funded by the public. It raises money through donations, legacies, community fundraising, events, retail and corporate partnerships. Over 40,000 people are regular volunteers.[1]
 The Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) was founded in 1902 as the Cancer Research Fund, changing its name to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund two years later. The charity grew over the next twenty years to become one of the world's leading cancer research charities.[8] Its flagship laboratories formerly at Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, and Clare Hall, Hertfordshire, and known as the Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, are now part of the Francis Crick Institute.[3]
 The British Empire Cancer Campaign (BECC) was founded in 1923, and initially drew a hostile response from ICRF and the Medical Research Council, who considered it a rival.[8][9] ""The Campaign"", as it was colloquially known, became a very successful and powerful grant-giving body. In 1970, the charity was renamed The Cancer Research Campaign (CRC).[9]
 In 2002 the two charities agreed to merge to form Cancer Research UK, the largest independent research organisation in the world dedicated to fighting cancer (the largest, the National Cancer Institute, is funded by the US Government).[10][11] At the time of the merger, the ICRF had an annual income of £124m, while the CRC had an income of £101m.[10]
 In the financial year 2014/15 the charity spent £422.67 million on cancer research projects (around 67% of its total income for that year). The bulk of the remaining costs were spent on trading and fundraising costs with a small amount also spent on information services, campaigning, advocacy, administration and other activities or was held in reserve.[1] The charity funds the work of over 4,000 researchers, doctors and nurses throughout the UK, supports over 200 clinical trials and studies cancer and cancer risk in over a million people in the UK.[12]
 Around 40% of the charity's research expenditure goes on basic laboratory research relevant to all types of cancer into the molecular basis of cancer.  The research is intended to improve understanding of how cancer develops and spreads and thus provide a foundation for other research.[13] The rest of its funding is used to support research into over 100 specific cancer types, focusing on key areas such as drug discovery and development; prevention, early detection and imaging; surgery and radiotherapy; and cancers where survival rates are still low, such as oesophageal, lung and pancreatic cancers.[14]
 In addition to funding individual researchers and projects, CRUK has several research institutes:[15]
 CRUK is a partner in:
 CRUK participates in numerous Citizen science projects including:
 The charity works in partnership with other organisations. These include the UK Department of Health, the Wellcome Trust, the National Health Service, NICE, and the National Cancer Intelligence Network. It is one of the partners in the National Cancer Research Institute which also includes the Medical Research Council (UK) and Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research.[19] It is also a major partner in the Francis Crick Institute.[20]
 Cancer Research UK scientists have been involved in the discovery and development of a number of clinically approved cancer drugs, including:
 Several of Cancer Research UK's scientists have also won major prizes, including:
 The charity provides information to the general public, the scientific community and healthcare professionals. Through Cancer Health UK, a website written in Plain English for anyone affected by cancer, it provides information on cancer and cancer care, and a unique clinical trials database.[2] A specialist team of cancer information nurses provides a confidential telephone service, the Cancer Chat forum provides a place for users to talk to others affected by cancer, and mobile cancer awareness units deliver health information to locations where cancer incidence and mortality are higher than average. It provides statistical information to healthcare professionals via the Cancer Stats section It also provides publications for the public to order and download at www.cancerresearchuk.org/leaflets.
 Cancer Research UK also publishes a twice-monthly professional medical journal, the British Journal of Cancer.
 The charity works with the UK governments to inform and improve cancer services. It worked to bring about the smoking ban in England and continues to campaign for further action on smoking.[29] The charity lobbies for better screening programmes and advises on access to new cancer medicines, amongst other issues.
 Fundraisers for CRUK include Race for Life and Stand Up to Cancer UK. On 18 July 2012 it was announced that Cancer Research UK was to receive its largest ever single donation of £10 million from an anonymous donor. The money went towards the £100 million funding needed for the Francis Crick Institute in London, the largest biomedical research building in Europe.[30]
 In June 2011 Cancer Research UK was one of several health charities (along with the British Heart Foundation, the Alzheimer's Society and Parkinson's UK) targeted by the animal rights organisation Animal Aid in a publicity campaign involving a series of advertisements in British newspapers urging members of the public to stop giving donations to organizations that fund medical research involving animal experiments.[31][32]
 In April 2017 the Information Commissioner’s Office fined eleven charities that breached the Data Protection Act by misusing donors’ personal data. Cancer Research UK was fined £16,000.[33]

Cardiac Risk in the Young	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_Risk_in_the_Young	"Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY) is a humanitarian charitable organisation helping to raise awareness of young sudden cardiac death (YSCD, SCD), including sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS, SDS). CRY was established in May 1995 by Alison Cox MBE and is based in the United Kingdom.
 The charity supports the families of victims of YSCD, facilitates the heart screening of young people through cardiac testing programmes and contributes to medical research.
 The CRY General Election Manifesto 2015 states: “Through awareness, support and screening many deaths can be prevented, and research into these conditions will be the key to providing the knowledge crucial to saving these young lives.”[1]
 CRY offers support to those who have suffered tragedies through a network of trained volunteer bereavement supporters,[2] counselling groups and medical information.[3] The charity also offers support and regular meetings to young people diagnosed with a cardiac condition through their myheart Network.[4]
 CRY holds regular subsidised ECG screening clinics for those aged 14 to 35 across the UK,[5] with the majority of events funded by bereaved families and free to the public.
 The charity funds an expert centre for fast-track cardiac pathology in the UK, the CRY Centre for Cardiac Pathology[6] (CRY CCP) at St George's Hospital, London. The centre is directed by Professor Mary Sheppard. Pathology is free of charge when the cause of death is unascertained and the deceased was aged 35 or under. CRY also funds the CRY Centre for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease and Sports Cardiology at St George’s Hospital. Professor Sanjay Sharma, medical director of the London Marathon, is CRY’s consultant cardiologist and leads their research programme.[7]
 On 15 July 2004 CRY launched its National Postcard Campaign[8] to highlight the deaths of eight young people per week from undiagnosed heart problems by featuring their pictures. The campaign was launched at a Parliamentary Reception in Westminster. From August 2004 the Postcard has been re-launched as region specific including South West, North East, South, North West, Scotland and Wales versions. 
In February 2009 the postcard campaign was updated to ""12 a week""[9] and continues to draw attention the number of young people with undetected heart conditions."
CARE	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARE_(relief_agency)	"CARE (Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere, formerly Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe[1]) is a major international humanitarian agency delivering emergency relief and long-term international development projects. Founded in 1945, CARE is nonsectarian, impartial, and non-governmental. It is one of the largest and oldest humanitarian aid organizations focused on fighting global poverty. In 2016, CARE reported working in 94 countries, supporting 962 poverty-fighting projects and humanitarian aid projects, and reaching over 80 million people and 256 million people indirectly.[2]
 CARE's programmes in the developing world address a broad range of topics including emergency response, food security, water and sanitation, economic development, climate change, agriculture, education, and health. CARE also advocates at the local, national, and international levels for policy change and the rights of poor people. Within each of these areas, CARE focuses on empowering and meeting the needs of women and girls and promoting gender equality.[2]
 CARE International is a confederation of fourteen CARE National Members, each of which is registered as an autonomous non-profit non-governmental organization in the country and four affiliate members.
 CARE, then the Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe,[3] was formally founded on November 27, 1945, and was originally intended to be a temporary organization.[4] World War II had ended in August of the same year. After pressure from the public and Congress, President Harry S. Truman agreed to let private organizations provide relief for those starving due to the war.[5] CARE was initially a consortium of twenty-two U.S. charities (a mixture of civic, religious, cooperative, farm, and labour organizations) with the purpose of delivering food aid to Europe in the aftermath of World War II.[6] The organization delivered its first food packages in 1946.[3]
 CARE's food aid took the form of CARE Packages, which were at first delivered to specific individuals: the US people paid $10 to send a CARE Package of  food to a loved one in Europe, often a family member. President Truman bought the first CARE package.[7]:p.1 CARE guaranteed delivery within four months to anyone in Europe, even if they had left their last known address, and returned a signed delivery receipt to the sender.[8] Because European postal services were unreliable at the time these signed receipts were sometimes the first confirmation that the recipient had survived the war.[6]
 The first CARE Packages were in fact surplus “Ten-in-One” US army rations packs (designed to contain a day's meals for ten people).[4] In early 1946 CARE purchased 2.8 million of these warehoused rations packs, originally intended for the invasion of Japan, and began advertising in America. On May 11, 1946, six months after the agency's incorporation, the first CARE Packages were delivered in Le Havre, France.[6] These packages contained staples such as canned meats, powdered milk, dried fruits, and fats along with a few comfort items such as chocolate, coffee, and cigarettes. (Several on the CARE Board of Directors wished to remove the cigarettes, but it was deemed impractical to open and reseal 2.8 million boxes.)[6] 1946 also marked CARE's first expansion out of the US with the establishment of an office in Canada.[9]
 By early 1947 the supply of ""Ten-in-One"" ration packs had been exhausted and CARE began assembling its own packages.[4] These new packages were designed with the help of a nutritionist. They did not include cigarettes and were tailored somewhat by destination: Kosher packages were developed, and for example packages for the United Kingdom included tea rather than coffee, and packages for Italy included pasta. By 1949 CARE offered and shipped more than twelve different packages.[4]
 Although the organization had originally intended to deliver packages only to specified individuals, within a year CARE began delivering packages addressed for example ""to a teacher"" or simply ""to a hungry person in Europe.""[6]:p.18 These unspecified donations continued and in early 1948 CARE's Board voted narrowly to officially move towards unspecified donations and to expand into more general relief. Some founding member agencies disagreed with this shift, arguing that more general relief would be a duplication of the work of other agencies, but donors reacted favourably, contributions increased, and this decision would mark the beginning of CARE’s shift towards a broader mandate.[4]
 Between the first deliveries of 1946 and the last European deliveries of 1956, millions of CARE Packages were distributed throughout Europe, over 50% of them to Germany [9] including many delivered as part of the Berlin airlift in response to the 1948 Soviet blockade of Berlin.[6]
 The US Agricultural Act of 1949 made surplus US agricultural products available to be shipped abroad as aid either directly by the US government or by NGOs including CARE.[6] In 1954 Public Law 480, also known as the Food for Peace Act, further expanded the availability of surplus US food as aid.[4] This act allowed CARE to expand its feeding programs and disaster relief operations considerably, and between 1949 and 2009 CARE used hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of surplus commodities in disaster relief and programs such as school lunch provision.[6]
 Although the organization's mission had originally been focused on Europe, in July 1948 CARE opened its first non-European mission, in Japan.[4] Deliveries to China and Korea followed, which CARE described as aid to areas ""implicated by WWII"".[10]:p.119 In 1949 CARE entered the developing world for the first time, launching programs in the Philippines. Projects in India, Pakistan, and Mexico began soon after.[6] 1949 also marked CARE's first expansion into non-food aid with the development of ""self-help"" packages containing tools for farming, carpentry, and other trades.[4] In 1953, because of its expansion to projects outside Europe, CARE changed the meaning of its acronym to ""Cooperative for American Remittances to Everywhere"".[4]
 As Europe recovered economically, CARE faced the need to re-evaluate its mission: in 1955 several Board members argued that with the European recovery CARE's mandate was finished and the organization should dissolve. Other Board members however felt that CARE's mission should continue albeit with a new focus on the developing world.[10] In July 1955 the Board of Directors voted to continue and expand CARE projects outside of Europe. Paul French, CARE's executive director at the time, resigned over the debate. New executive director Richard W. Reuter took over in 1955 and helped lead the organization in a new direction.[11]  Twenty-two of CARE's forty-two missions were closed, mostly in European countries, and efforts were concentrated on food distribution and emergency response in the developing world.[4] In 1956 CARE distributed food to refugees of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and this would be among the last of CARE's operations in Europe for many years.[6]
 With a broadened geographic focus came a broadened approach as CARE began to expand beyond its original food distribution program. In order to reflect these new broader aims, in 1959 CARE changed the meaning of its acronym a second time, becoming the ""Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere"".[4]
Reflecting this broadened scope, CARE became involved in 1961 with President John F. Kennedy's establishment of the Peace Corps. CARE was charged with selecting and training the first group of volunteers, who would later be deployed to development projects in Colombia. The Peace Corps assumed greater control over the training of Peace Corps Volunteers in subsequent missions, but CARE continued to provide country directors to the Peace Corps until CARE-Peace Corps joint projects ended in 1967.[4]
 In 1962 CARE merged with and absorbed the medical aid organization MEDICO, which it had been working closely with for several years previously. The merger considerably increased CARE's capacity to deliver health programming including trained medical personnel and medical supplies.[4]
 During this transition the original CARE Package was phased out.[4] The last food package was delivered in 1967 and the last tools package in 1968.[12] Over 100 million CARE Packages had been delivered worldwide since the first shipment to France.[13] Although 1968 marked the official ""retirement"" of the CARE Package the format would occasionally be used again, for example in CARE's relief to the republics of the former Soviet Union and to survivors of the Bosnian War.[14] The concept was also revived in 2011 as an online campaign encouraging donors to fill a ""virtual CARE Package"" with food aid and services such as education and healthcare.[15]
 1967 also marked CARE's first partnership agreement with a government: for the construction of schools in Honduras. Partnership agreements with governments led programmes to become country-wide rather than targeted only to a few communities. CARE's programmes during this era focused largely on the construction of schools and nutrition centres, and the continued distribution of food. Nutrition centres in particular would become one of CARE's major areas of concentration, linking with school feeding programs and nutrition education aimed at new mothers.[4]
 In 1975 CARE implemented a multi-year planning system, again allowing programmes to become both broader and deeper in scope. Projects became increasingly multi-faceted, providing for example not only health education but also access to clean water and an agricultural program to improve nutrition. The multi-year planning system also increased the scope for country-wide projects and partnerships with local governments. A 1977 project for example provided for the construction of over 200 pre-schools and kindergartens throughout Chile over several years, jointly funded by CARE and the Chilean Ministry of Education.[4]
 Although CARE had opened an office in Canada in 1946, it was not until the mid-1970s that the organization truly started to become an international body.[9] CARE Canada (initially Care of Canada) became an autonomous body in 1973. In 1976 CARE Europe was established in Bonn following the successful fund-raising campaign ""Dank an CARE"" (Thanks to CARE). In 1981 CARE Germany was created and CARE Europe moved its headquarters to Paris.[4] CARE Norway had been created in 1980,[16] and CAREs in Italy and the UK were established. The popularity of CARE offices in Europe was attributed to the fact that many Europeans remembered receiving CARE assistance themselves between 1945 and 1955.[4]
 In 1979 planning began for the establishment of an umbrella organization to coordinate and prevent duplication among the various national CARE organizations. This new body was named CARE International and met for the first time on January 29, 1982, with CARE Canada, CARE Germany, CARE Norway, and CARE USA (formerly simply CARE) in attendance.[4]
 CARE International would expand significantly during the 1980s, with the addition of CARE France in 1983;[17] CARE International UK in 1985;[18] CARE Austria in 1986;[19] and CARE Australia, CARE Denmark, and CARE Japan in 1987.[20][21][22]
 Along with broader development work CARE's projects in the 1980s and early 1990s focused particularly on agroforestry initiatives such as reforestation and soil conservation in eastern Africa and South America. CARE also responded to a number of major emergencies during this period, notably the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia and the 1991–1992 famine in Somalia.[4]
 The 1990s also saw an evolution in CARE's approach to poverty. Originally CARE had viewed poverty primarily as a lack of basic goods and services such as food, clean water, and health care. As CARE's scope expanded both geographically and topically this approach was expanded to include the view that poverty was in many cases caused by social exclusion, marginalization, and discrimination. In the early 1990s CARE adopted a household livelihood security framework which included a multidimensional view of poverty as encompassing not only physical resources but also social position and human capacities. As a result of this, by 2000, CARE had adopted a rights-based approach to development.[13]
 One of their buildings was attacked, and people were killed and wounded, during the September 2016 Kabul attacks.
 In the early 1990s CARE also developed what would become an important model for cooperative microfinance.
 This model is called the Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) and it began in 1991 as a pilot project run by CARE's Country Office in Niger.[23] The pilot project was called Mata Masu Dubara (MMD) and CARE Niger developed the VSLA model by adapting the model of Accumulating Savings and Credit Associations (ASCAs). VSLAs involve groups of about 15-30 people who regularly save and borrow using a group fund. Member savings create capital that can be used for short-term loans and capital and interest is shared among the group at the end of a given period (usually about a year), at which point the groups normally re-form to begin a new cycle. Because the bookkeeping required to manage a VSLA is quite simple most groups successfully become independent (needing no outside management help) within a year and enjoy a high rate of long-term group survival.[24] CARE has created over 40,000 VSLAs (over 1 million members total) across Africa, Asia, and Latin America[23] and in 2008 launched Access Africa which aims to extend VSLA training to 39 African countries by 2018.[25]
 The model has also been widely replicated in Africa and Asia and by other large NGOs including Oxfam, Plan International, and Catholic Relief Services.[26]
 CARE UK later launched lendwithcare.org, which allows members of the public to make microloans, including green loans, to entrepreneurs in Africa and Asia. It avoids many of the criticisms levelled at Kiva.org.
 In 1993 CARE, to reflect its international organizational structure, changed the meaning of its acronym for a third time, adopting its current name the ""Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere"". CARE also marked its 50th anniversary in 1994.[13]
 CARE expanded the confederation to twelve members in the early 2000s, with CARE Netherlands (formerly the Disaster Relief Agency) joining in 2001[27] and CARE Thailand (called the Raks Thai Foundation) joining in 2003, becoming the first CARE National Member in a developing country.[28]
 CARE's well-known ""I am Powerful"" campaign launched in the USA in September 2006 and was intended to bring public attention to the organization's long-standing focus on women's empowerment.[13] CARE states that its programs focus on women and girls both because the world's poor are disproportionately female and because women's empowerment is thought to be an important driver of development. CARE also emphasizes that it considers working with boys and men an important part of women's empowerment, and that women's empowerment benefits both genders.[2]
 In 2007 CARE announced that by 2009 it would no longer accept certain types of US food aid worth some $45 million a year, arguing that these types of food aid are inefficient and harmful to local markets.[29][30] Specifically, CARE announced that it would forego all monetized food aid (surplus US food shipped to charities in the developing world who then sell the food on the local market to finance development projects)[30] and all food aid intended to establish a commercial advantage for the donor, and would increase its commitment to buying food aid locally.[31] CARE also announced that it would no longer accept USDA food through Title 1 (concessional sales) or Section 416 (surplus disposal) because these programs are intended mainly to establish a commercial advantage for US agriculture.[31]
 In 2011 CARE added its first Affiliate Member, CARE India, and in 2012 the CI board accepted CARE Peru as CARE's second Affiliate Member.[2] CARE India became a full member in November 2013. The CI board accepted CARE Peru as a full member of the confederation in June 2015.
 CARE is currently one of the only major NGOs to make their database of project evaluations publicly available, and to regularly conduct a meta-analysis of evaluation methodologies and overall organizational impact.[32][33]
 CARE International is a confederation of fourteen CARE National Members, coordinated by the CARE International Secretariat. The Secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland, with offices in New York and in Brussels in order to liaise with the United Nations and the European institutions respectively.[37]
 Each CARE National Member is an autonomous non-governmental organization registered in the country, and each Member runs programs, fundraising, and communications activities both in its own country and in developing countries where CARE operates. There are fourteen National Members. The fourteen CARE National Members and four Affiliate Members are:[37]
 Affiliate members are marked with an asterisk (*)
 In 2016 CARE
was active in the following countries (as well as in Member and Affiliate countries):[2]
 A total of 962 development and humanitarian aid projects were carried out in these countries, with 80,120,323 million people directly reached. The breakdown by region was as follows:[2]
 For the fiscal year 2016, CARE reported a budget of more than 574 million Euros and a staff of 9,175 (94% of them local citizens of the country where they work).[2]
 CARE supports emergency relief as well as prevention, preparedness, and recovery programs. In 2016, CARE reportedly reached more than 7.2 million people through its humanitarian response.CARE's core sectors for emergency response are Food Security, Shelter, WASH and Sexual & Reproductive Health. CARE is a signatory of major international humanitarian standards and codes of conduct including the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief, the Sphere standards, and the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP) principles and standards.
 CARE is a signatory to the following standards of humanitarian intervention: the Code of Conduct for The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief,[40] the Sphere standards,[41] and the Core Humanitarian Standard[42]
As well, CARE is a member of a number of networks aiming to improve the quality and coordination of humanitarian aid: The Emergency Capacity Building Project (ECB),[43] The Consortium of British Humanitarian Agencies (CBHA),[44] the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in Humanitarian Action (ALNAP),[45] the Steering Committee for Humanitarian Response (SHCR),[46] the International Council for Voluntary Agencies (ICVA),[47] and the INGO Accountability Charter.[48] CARE also regularly engages in joint advocacy campaigns with other major NGOs. The Global Campaign for Climate Change Action is one example.[49]"
Caritas	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caritas_(charity)	"Caritas Internationalis is a confederation of 165[2] Catholic relief, development and social service organisations operating in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.
 Collectively and individually their claimed mission is to work to build a better world, especially for the poor and oppressed.[3] The first Caritas organisation was established by Lorenz Werthmann on 9 November 1897 in Germany.[1] Other national Caritas organisations were soon formed in Switzerland (1901) and the United States (Catholic Charities, 1910).
 In July 1924, during the international Eucharistic Congress in Amsterdam, 60 delegates from 22 countries formed a conference, with headquarters at Caritas Switzerland in Lucerne. In 1928, the conference became known as Caritas Catholica. The delegates met every two years until the outbreak of the Second World War when all activities came to a standstill. Work resumed in 1947, with the approval of the Secretariat of State, and two conferences convened in Lucerne to help coordinate efforts and collaboration. 
 Caritas was given a further endorsement when the Secretariat of State entrusted it with the official representation of all welfare organisations at the international level, especially at the United Nations. The Holy Year in 1950 saw the beginning of a union of Caritas organisations. Following a suggestion by Msgr Montini, then Substitute Secretary of State, and later Pope Paul VI, a study week, with participants from 22 countries, was held in Rome to examine the problems of Christian Caritas work. As a result, the decision was made to set up an international conference of Roman Catholic charities.
 In December 1951, upon approval of the statutes by the Holy See, the first constitutive General Assembly of Caritas Internationalis took place. Founding members came from Caritas organisations in 13 countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. The Church describes Caritas as its official voice “in relation to its teachings in the area of charity work”.[4]
 In 1954, the Confederation changed its name to Caritas Internationalis to reflect the international presence of Caritas members on every continent.[4] As of 2015, the Confederation has 164 members working in over 200 countries and territories. Its General Secretariat is located in the Palazzo San Callisto, Vatican City. The current president is Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle and the Secretary General is Michel Roy.[5]
 The full membership list of Caritas organisations includes:
 45 national agencies in Sub-Saharan Africa
 24 national agencies including:
 Caritas Europa with 48 national agencies including:
 6 regional agencies, including:"
Carter Center	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Center	"The Carter Center is a nongovernmental, not-for-profit organization founded in 1982 by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. He and his wife Rosalynn Carter partnered with Emory University just after his defeat in the 1980 U.S. Presidential elections. The center is located in a shared building adjacent to the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum on 37 acres (150,000 m2) of parkland, on the site of the razed neighborhood of Copenhill, two miles (3 km) from downtown Atlanta, Georgia. The library and museum are owned and operated by the United States National Archives and Records Administration, while the Center is governed by a Board of Trustees, consisting of business leaders, educators, former government officials, and philanthropists.
 The Carter Center's goal is to advance human rights and alleviate human suffering,[5] including helping improve the quality of life for people in more than 80 countries.[6] The center has many projects including election monitoring, supporting locally led state-building and democratic institution-building in various countries, mediating conflicts between warring states, and intervening with heads of states on behalf of victims of human rights abuses. It also leads disease eradication efforts, spearheading the campaign to eradicate Guinea worm disease, as well as controlling and treating onchocerciasis, trachoma, lymphatic filariasis, and malaria through awareness campaigns.
 In 2002, President Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work “to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development” through the Carter Center.[7] In 2007, he wrote an autobiography entitled Beyond the White House: Waging Peace, Fighting Disease, Building Hope, which chronicles the first 25 years of The Carter Center.
 The Center was founded in 1982 and dedicated in 1986 with William Foege as its executive director.[8]
 In 1993, John Hardman was appointed executive director, and during the 1990s the Center received several multimillion-dollar donations to fight Guinea worm disease and to prevent blindness.[9]
 In 1994, the center launched an initiative called ""Not Even One"" to fight child death by firearm.
 On October 2, 1995, The Rosalynn Carter Georgia Mental Health Forum was held at The Carter Center.
 The Center is governed by a board of trustees, which oversees the organization’s assets and property and promotes its objectives and goals.
 A community advisory group – the Board of Councilors – includes public and private-sector leaders who support The Carter Center and its activities in their communities and organizations. Members attend quarterly presentations on the Center’s work.
 CEO (Ret.) Ambassador Mary Ann Peters[3] oversees the Center’s day-to-day operations and staff of 175.[1]
 Center-based councils of eminent persons who offer guidance to or participate in Center activities include: the Council of Presidents and Prime Ministers of the Americas,[10] the International Task Force for Disease Eradication,[11] and the Mental Health Task Force.[12] The Carter Center also collaborates with other public and private organizations.
 The Carter Center performs election observation, sending teams of observers to determine the legitimacy of 101 elections[13] in 39 countries since 1989.[14]
 Carter Center observers analyze election laws, assess voter education and registration processes, and evaluate fairness in campaigns. The presence of impartial election observers deters interference or fraud in the voting process, and reassures voters that they can safely and secretly cast their ballots and that vote tabulation will be conducted without tampering.
 Teams typically include 30-100 highly qualified impartial observers – regional leaders, political scientists, regional specialists, and election observation professionals.
 The Carter Center sends observers only when invited by a country’s electoral authorities and welcomed by the major political parties. Observers do not interfere in the electoral process and do not represent the U.S. government.[15]
 The Center played a key role – with the U.N. Electoral Assistance Division and the National Democratic Institute – in building consensus on a common set of international principles for election observation.[16]  It is also leading the effort to develop effective methodologies for observing elections that employ new electronic voting technologies.[17]
 The Carter Center supports the growth of democratic institutions to ensure that there is a respect for rule of law and human rights, that government decisions are open and transparent, and that everyone can have adequate resources to compete fairly for public office.
 For example, the Center is supporting the efforts of civic leaders in Ethiopia to convene discussions about the most pressing and contentious political and social issues facing the country, and in the Palestinian Territories, it maintains a small presence in Ramallah focused on the ongoing monitoring and analysis of critical issues of democratic development.[18]
 Democratic initiatives in Latin America include support for regional access-to-information programs, creation of an inter-American support network, and reform of political campaign financing. The Center-based Council of Presidents and Prime Ministers of the Americas plays an important role in accomplishing these objectives.[19]
 The Carter Center also promotes the dissemination to emerging democracies and regional organizations of models, lessons, and best practices for democratic governance. The goal is to empower those in transitioning countries who are trying to build stronger democratic institutions and practices.
 The Carter Center believes all people are entitled to basic human rights. These rights include political rights, such as peace, freedom, and self-governance, as well as the social rights of health care, food, shelter, and economic opportunity.
 The Center actively supports human rights defenders around the world. In partnership with Human Rights First and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Center holds an annual human rights defenders policy forum hosted by President Carter in Atlanta.[20]
 President and Mrs. Carter have intervened with heads of state on behalf of human rights defenders and victims for more than 20 years. They often take their human rights concerns to heads of state in personal meetings and through letters.
 The Center and President Carter are strong supporters of the U.N. Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court. Both oppose the death penalty and urge its abolition in the U.S.
 Recalling President Carter’s success in the White House negotiating the long-lasting peace treaty between Israel and Egypt,[21] groups in conflict turn to The Carter Center to help them prevent and resolve conflict. Lacking any official authority, the Center has become a trusted broker for peace, serving as a channel for dialogue and negotiation.
 Recent examples include:
 Since 1988, the Chinese government has authorized direct village elections to help maintain social and political order in the context of rapid economic reforms. At the invitation of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Carter Center initiated a joint project in 1998 to standardize Chinese village election procedures and assist in training of election officials and elected National People’s Congress deputies. In 2011, the Carter Center was asked by the Chinese government to no longer observe elections and instead focus on advancing the US- China relationship.
 The Center has prevented the suffering of millions of people around the world from illnesses often ignored by others. Health programs seek to provide people with the information and access to services they need to treat their illnesses and take steps to prevent future spread of disease. An emphasis is placed on building partnerships for change among international agencies, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and corporations and on working with ministries of health to strengthen or establish permanent health care delivery systems in the poorest nations.
 During his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, Carter commented on what he felt is the greatest challenge the world faces:
 “Among all the possible choices, I decided that the most serious and universal problem is the growing chasm between the richest and poorest people on earth. Citizens of the ten wealthiest countries are now 75 times richer than those who live in the ten poorest ones, and the separation is increasing every year, not only between nations but also within them. The results of this disparity are root causes of most of the world’s unresolved problems, including starvation, illiteracy, environmental degradation, violent conflict and unnecessary illnesses that range from Guinea worm to HIV/AIDS. Tragically, in the industrialized world there is a terrible absence of understanding or concern about those who are enduring lives of despair and hopelessness. We have not yet made the commitment to share with others an appreciable part of our excessive wealth. This is a necessary and potentially rewarding burden that we should all be willing to assume.""[30]
 The Carter Center began spearheading the campaign to eradicate Guinea worm disease worldwide in 1986.  At the time, there were about 3.5 million annual cases of the disease in 20 countries in Africa and Asia. In 2016 there were 25 reported cases in three countries: South Sudan, Chad and Ethiopia.[31] Guinea worm disease is poised to be the first parasitic disease to be eradicated and the only disease to be eradicated without the use of vaccines or drugs.
 Within affected countries, the Center reinforces existing disease eradication programs by providing technical and financial assistance, as well as logistics and tools, such as donated filter cloth material, larvicide, and medical kits.[32]
 The International Task Force for Disease Eradication has been based at The Carter Center since its formation in 1988. The group has reviewed more than 100 infectious diseases and identified six as potentially eradicable – dracunculiasis, poliomyelitis, mumps, rubella, lymphatic filariasis, and cysticercosis.[33]
 Since 1996, the Center has been a leader in the fight against onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness – a parasitic disease transmitted by the bites of black flies.
 The Center has worked to stop the spread of the disease in 11 countries across Africa and the Americas by helping residents and local health workers institute and sustain drug treatment programs and health education activities. The international river blindness campaign seeks to eliminate the disease from the Western Hemisphere by 2015.[34]
 The Center has distributed more than 125 million doses of Mectizan (ivermectin)[35] – a drug donated by Merck & Co., Inc., that treats and prevents river blindness.[36]
 Center health workers also prevent transmission of trachoma – a bacterial infection that is the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Trachoma is prevalent in places that lack the tools for basic hygiene, clean water, and adequate sanitation.
 The Center follows the World Health Organization’s four-pronged approach – called the SAFE strategy – to fight trachoma in six African countries.[37] The Trachoma Control Program is working to improve sanitation in those communities by building latrines, providing corrective surgery, distributing antibiotics, and educating communities on basic hygiene.
 As of March 2010[update], The Carter Center has helped to build more than one million latrines in its effort to fight trachoma.[35]
 The latrines contain and prevent human waste from serving as a breeding ground for the disease-carrying flies, thereby reducing one way the disease is spread.[38]
 Lymphatic filariasis and malaria are mosquito-borne diseases also targeted by The Carter Center. The Center has distributed four million long-lasting insecticidal bed nets.[35] It has also established drug distribution systems in Nigeria to treat and stem the spread of lymphatic filariasis and schistosomiasis.[39]
 The Carter Center believes in building networks of village-based health care workers to treat people for various diseases at the same time. Emphasis is on helping national and local governments establish programs that they can sustain into the future.
 Since 1997, the Center established with the Ethiopian ministries of health and education the Ethiopia Public Health Training Initiative to improve academic training for health care personnel in Ethiopia and increase access to health care in rural communities throughout the country.
 In partnership with the Sasakawa Africa Association, the Center has worked since 1986 in 15 sub-Saharan African countries to teach 8-10 million small-scale farmers improved techniques that double or triple their crop yields.[40]
 The program promotes use of fertilizers and crop protection chemicals, soil fertility, and environmentally friendly agronomic methods of crop production. It also supports efforts to construct quality grain storage to sustain market prices for the farmer and ensure greater food security, establish farmers' associations, and use quality food crops such as high-protein maize.
 Rosalynn Carter leads the Center’s efforts to fight stigma associated with mental illness. The Center works to improve U.S. public policies that can help prevent mental illnesses and increase equity in mental health care, holding an annual symposium with national leaders in mental health and other fields.
 The Center also seeks to raise public awareness of mental health issues globally through the Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism, which enable journalists to explore mental health issues. To date, more than 100 journalists have participated in the program.[41]
 Mr. Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work through The Carter Center.[7] The Carter Center received the inaugural Delta Prize for Global Understanding in 1999 – an award administered by the University of Georgia.[42]
 In 2006, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation presented The Carter Center with the Gates Award for Global Health.[43] The center was awarded Hamdan Award for Volunteers in Humanitarian Medical Services for 2013-14.[44]
 The center holds an annual auction, which raised $1.6 million in 2013.[45]
 Alan Dershowitz asserts that the Center's focus ""is away from significant Arab abuses and on Israel's far less serious ones"" and that this is influenced by the Center's receipt of donations from Arab sources.[46]  One of the initial contributors to the Center was Bank of Commerce and Credit International founder Agha Hasan Abedi, who donated $500,000. Abedi and BCCI also donated $8 million to Carter's Global 2000 project.[47]
 According to the Center, 3 percent of the total amount of contributions it has received since its founding in 1982 have been from donors in Mideast Arab nations.[48]
 Of the donations from the Middle East, the Center states: ""Seventy-eight percent of those funds have helped to support health programs in Africa, 14 percent have gone to the institution's endowment, 4 percent were for original construction of buildings at headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and 4 percent for projects to directly promote peace, such as specific election observations.[48]
 Some individuals have disputed the Center’s endorsement of the electoral process in the Venezuelan recall referendum of 2004.[49] Fox News' Doug Schoen told Michael Barone of U.S. News and World Report, ""Our internal sourcing tells us that there was fraud in the Venezuelan central commission. There are widespread reports of irregularities and evidence of fraud, many of them ably recorded by Mary Anastasia O'Grady in The Wall Street Journal last week. Carter is untroubled by any of this, and declares that Chavez won 'fair and square.'""[50][51] The Carter Center looked into the allegations and released a paper and statistical analysis reaffirming their original conclusions.[52]"
Carthage Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage_Foundation	"The Scaife Foundations refer collectively to three foundations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The three subdivisions are: the Allegheny Foundation, the Sarah Scaife Foundation, and the Scaife Family Foundation. A fourth foundation, the Carthage Foundation, was folded into the Sarah Scaife Foundation in 2014.[1]
 Richard Mellon Scaife endowed the foundation and served as the chairman.  It makes grants to historical, educational, political, and pro- and anti-environmental organizations, especially those located in or serving Western Pennsylvania.  From 1985 to 2006 the foundation awarded over $36 million to other organizations.[2]
 In 2007, the Allegheny Foundation made grants of $3,195,500 to 45 organizations.  The five organizations receiving the largest grants were:[3]
 The 2007 annual report also noted that, at the end of that year, the foundation had nearly $55 million in cash and common stocks.
 The Sarah Scaife Foundation does not award grants to individuals.  It concentrates its efforts towards politically conservative causes focused on public policy at a national and international level.[4] From 1985 to 2003 the organization awarded over $235 million to other organizations.
 The organizations it has supported include the George C. Marshall Institute, Project for the New American Century, the Institute for Humane Studies,[5] Reason Foundation,[6] and Judicial Watch.
 Prior to its 2014 merger, like the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the Carthage Foundation did not award grants to individuals.  It concentrated its efforts towards causes focused on public policy at a national and international level.  From 1985 to 2003 the organization awarded over $68 million to other organizations.
 The Scaife Family Foundation does not award grants to individuals.[citation needed]  It concentrates its efforts towards causes focused on families, women, children, and animal welfare.  From 1985 to 2001 the organization awarded over $77 million to other organizations.[citation needed]
 A 2013 Smithsonian Magazine article listed the Foundation as among the largest contributors to the climate change counter-movement from 2003 to 2010.[7]"
Casa Pia	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Pia	"The Casa Pia is a Portuguese institution founded by Maria I, known as A Pia (""Mary the Pious""), and organized by Police Intendant Pina Manique in 1780, following the social disarray of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. For almost three centuries, thousands of young boys and girls were raised by Casa Pia, including many public personalities, called casapianos. Casa Pia is Portugal's largest educational institution dedicated to helping youngsters in risk of social exclusion or without parental support.
 The organisation is composed of ten schools and enrolls approximately 4700 students. In addition to standard schooling, the organisation also provides boarding for children in need.  It strives to enable these youngsters to become healthy and successful members of society, by developing intellectual, manual, and physical traits, in an environment promoting spiritual, moral, and religious values. The institution is proud to have had amongst its students many outstanding Portuguese personalities, including politicians, journalists, and artists.
 The first location was in Castle of São Jorge of Lisbon, an important center of production for the Portuguese Royal Navy and Army, and also for vocational education: masters trained at Casa Pia, when returned to their home, instruct others in the same profession. More advanced alumns may advance to professional careers. Next level course studies at London (for medicine), the Portuguese Royal Navy academy, Rome, and the Portuguese Academy.
 Two years after the death of Pina Manique, the Casa Pia closed due to the occupation of the Castle of São Jorge by the French troops of Junot. The school reopened in 1812 at Convento do Desterro, and then the government moved the institution to Jerónimos Monastery, Lisbon at 1833. In 1942, it created a network of homes for children. At this time it is formed by:
 And also as complementary services:
 Casa Pia de Lisboa made world headlines because of a major child sexual abuse scandal. Incidents reportedly began occurring starting in the 1970s, but were only revealed in 2002. Many prominent people were arrested, including Paulo Pedroso, (former Socialist minister, with charges later dropped), Portuguese TV host Carlos Cruz (television host) and former ambassador Jorge Ritto, among others.
 As a result, the scandal and the Lisbon trial inundated public life with sordid child abuse stories, leading to a media circus from 2003 to 2005. On September 3, 2010, after one of the longest trials in Portuguese history. Carlos Cruz (seven years), Carlos Silvino (eighteen years), Hugo Marçal (six years, two months), Manuel Abrantes (five years, nine months), Ferreira Diniz (seven years) and Jorge Ritto (six years, eight months) were convicted on charges of pedophilia and other crimes that had occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This was the first time an institutional sex abuse scandal was taken to court in Portugal."
Catholic Charities USA	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Charities_USA	"Catholic Charities is a network of charities with headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. In 2005 Forbes magazine ranked it as the fifth largest charity in the United States in terms of total revenue.[3] The organization serves millions of people a year, regardless of their religious, social, or economic backgrounds
 Catholic Charities USA is a member of Caritas Internationalis, an international federation of Catholic social service organizations.[4] Catholic Charities USA is the national office of 165 local Catholic Charities agencies nationwide.
 Founded in 1910 as the National Conference of Catholic Charities, the organization changed its name in 1986 to Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA).[5] CCUSA's president and CEO, Sister Donna Markham OP, Ph.D., is the first female president to lead CCUSA in the organization's 105-year history. She has held this position since 2015.[6]
 Their motto is ""Working to reduce poverty in America"". Their mission statement is ""The mission of Catholic Charities is to provide service to people in need, to advocate for justice in social structures, and to call the entire church and other people of good will to do the same.""[7]
 Catholic Charities uses a variety of approaches to deal with poverty, providing basic needs to individuals and advocacy to address systemic poverty. Through its member agencies, Catholic Charities provides services to millions of people a year through activities such as housing, health care, and disaster relief. Some services are provided directly by member agencies; in other instances, in conjunction with other organizations.[citation needed] In 2017, Catholic Charities named Daisy ""Estelle"" Anderson Volunteer of the Year. Anderson has created layettes for more than 10,000 families over the past thirty years.[8] This includes creating crib linens, clothing, toys and diapers for newborns in need.
 The organization's archives are housed at The Catholic University of America.[9]
 In 1990, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops commissioned CCUSA to respond to disasters in the United States. Relief and recovery services are provided at the local level by Catholic Charities agencies across the country. These agencies provide critical services including emergency food, shelter, direct financial assistance, counseling, and support. CCUSA's Disaster Operations coordinates the Catholic Church's response to disasters in the United States and grants relief funds to local Catholic Charities agencies to support their relief efforts. Catholic Charities has responded to disasters across the country, including the attacks on September 11,[10] Hurricanes Katrina and Rita,[11] the Gulf Coast oil spill,[12] and the impact of Superstorm Sandy.[13]
 Catholic Charities USA is governed by a Board of Trustees, many of whom are lead local Catholic Charities agencies across the country.[2] There are 160 member organizations nationwide, nearly one per diocese.[14]
 Catholic Charities uses about 89% of its revenue for program costs.[15][16] Catholic Charities is listed as an Accredited Charity by the Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance.[16]
 In 2010, Catholic Charities had revenues of $4.7 billion, $2.9 billion of which came from the US government. About $140 million came from donations from diocesan churches, the remainder coming from in-kind contributions, investments, program fees, and community donations.[17] The Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Washington holds a fundraising gala every year and raised $2.4 million in 2017.[18]
 In 1727, French Ursuline Sisters founded an orphanage in New Orleans, Louisiana, the first Catholic charitable institution in the area that later became the United States.[19] During the nineteenth century, provision of Catholic charity was for the most part a local matter. However, the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, which was organized in the United States in 1845 in St. Louis, Missouri, soon spread to other cities and dioceses. The SVDP Society held national meetings, which served as a point of contact for members working at the local level, and played a significant role in the formation of the National Conference of Catholic Charities.
 By 1900, there were more than 800 Catholic institutions dedicated to the care of children, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled. According to Jack Hansan of the Social Welfare History Project, by 1910 about half of the approximately 15 million Catholics in the United States lived in poverty. Only three diocesan charity agencies were organized prior to 1910. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and ensuing fire prompted the Archdiocese of San Francisco to form Catholic Charities CYO the following year to assist destitute families and care for children who were orphaned by the disaster.[20]
 On September 25, 1910, representatives of many service agencies met at The Catholic University of America at the invitation of its rector, Bishop Thomas J. Shahan, and formed the National Conference of Catholic Charities (NCCC) to support and coordinate their efforts.[21] They held their final meeting at the White House at the invitation of President Taft.[22]
 The new organization drew its inspiration from the social teachings of Pope Leo XII, whose Rerum novarum (1891), in one scholar's words, sought to ""free [the Church] from paralyzing resistance to bourgeois civilization by shifting attention from the intractable problems of church and state to the social question, where a more flexible pastoral and evangelical approach might be possible.""[23] The organization's founding also paralleled the development of social work as a profession and the increasing cooperation among sectarian charitable organizations. Msgr. William J. Kerby, the first executive director of NCCC, described the problems a few years later: ""The intense individualism of institutional and geographical units of the Church's life has ... led to a variety and resourcefulness that have been admirable. But it has resulted in a mutual independence and lack of coordination that have undoubtedly interfered with progress in certain ways....""[24] Several Catholic educational institutions established social work programs in the decade after the founding of the NCCC, beginning with Loyola of Chicago (1914) and Fordham (1916).[25]
 In 1917 the NCCC established the Catholic Charities Review to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and theories, and a resource for those who could not attend meetings. Catholic Charities Review was the successor publication to the Vincentians’ Quarterly.[20]
 Monsignor John O'Grady, a native of Ireland, worked alongside Kerby for several years. When Kerby stepped down as Executive Secretary in 1920, O'Grady became his successor. O'Grady became acquainted with Jane Addams, founder of Hull House, while studying in Chicago.[20] Under his leadership, by 1931 there were fifty-eight diocesan organization functioning. Diocesan agencies began to expand their activities from dealing almost exclusively with the care of children to addressing wider issues of family welfare. The greatest challenge of O'Grady's tenure was the Great Depression. He served forty years as executive director and frequently spoke for the organization on matters of public policy. He supported the Social Security Act of 1935 and federal housing legislation. O'Grady fought against passage of the McCarran–Walter Act. The bill restricted immigration into the U.S., making it more difficult for World War II refugees to enter the United States. O'Grady said that the bill, which continued a national quota system that favored immigrants from Western European nations, ""perpetuates the doctrine of Nordic superiority.""[26]
 In March 1949, O'Grady, executive secretary of NCCC, testified before the House Ways and Means Committee in opposition to legislation proposed by the Truman administration that would have created a program of federal grants to support state relief and welfare programs. He said: ""It envisages a complete governmental program that will virtually take over the entire field of child welfare. How can we maintain our spirit of Christian charity, our spirit of brotherhood, without the appeal of the great charitable institutions for the care of children?"" He said it would ""bring the Federal Government with all its rules and regulations into every community in the United States to set up governmental programs for the care of children"" and that the legislation implied ""national control over family life"". He believed that some states were legally prohibited from purchasing services from religious organizations, and cited Pennsylvania as one where ""Catholic and other religious childcare programs would be practically wiped out.""[27] In April, NCCC opposed Truman's proposed national health insurance program as well, and both measures were defeated.[28] In September 1952, Truman appointed O'Grady to the President's Commission on Immigration and Naturalization.[29]
 Pope John Paul II addressed the national conference of Catholic Charities USA in San Antonio, Texas, on September 14, 1987.[30] His call for increased efforts on behalf of the poor and ""to reform structures which cause or perpetuate their oppression"" prompted coverage of the organization's activism, including, according to the New York Times, ""a wide range of projects in antipoverty, legal aid, voter registration, housing and community organization.""[31]
 During the 2012 debate over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Catholic Charities USA was among the Catholic groups that expressed support for the Obama administration's efforts to address religious objections to some features of its implementation, even as the National Conference of Catholic Bishops opposed the administration's proposals as part of a larger government attack on religious liberty.[32] Several diocesan branches of Catholic Charities participated in a lawsuit against provisions related to birth control insurance coverage, but not the national organization.[33]
 Catholic Charities USA has endorsed the DREAM Act[34] and the Obama administration's deferral of action against some younger immigrants.[35] Catholic Charities sponsors efforts to reduce homelessness in the United States, with cooperation with state and local government. In Saint Paul, Minnesota, Catholic Charities manages the Dorothy Day homeless shelter as well as the Higher Ground Saint Paul Shelter which provides shelter drop-in meals and career services.[36][37]
 Between about 1985 and 1995, Catholic Charities of Boston, which contracted with the state's Department of Social Services and accepted state funds in support of their adoption services program, placed 13 children with gay couples out of 720 adoptions. Catholic Charities President Rev. J. Bryan Hehir explained the practice: ""If we could design the system ourselves, we would not participate in adoptions to gay couples, but we can't. We have to balance various goods."" The agency had never sought an exemption from the state's anti-discrimination statute,[38] which had taken effect in 1989.[39][n 1]
 In December 2005, the lay-dominated board of Catholic Charities of Boston voted unanimously to continue gay adoptions. On February 28, 2006, Archbishop Seán P. O'Malley and Hehir met with Governor Mitt Romney to make the case for an exemption from the state's non-discrimination statute, but Romney told them he was unable to help. They considered and rejected the idea of a lawsuit. On March 10, O'Malley and leaders of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Boston announced that the agency would terminate its adoption work effective June 30, rather than continue to place children under the guardianship of homosexuals. The statement did not distinguish between gay and lesbian individuals and those in same-sex relationships.[n 2] Hehir said ""This is a difficult and sad day for Catholic Charities. We have been doing adoptions for more than 100 years.""[40][n 3]
 In March 2011, after Lutheran Child and Family Services denied a gay couple a foster care license, the Chicago Tribune reported that Illinois officials were investigating whether religious agencies that received public funds were breaking anti-discrimination laws if they turned down applications from gay parents. In Illinois, adults who adopt or become foster care providers must obtain a foster care license from one of 57 private child welfare agencies or directly from the Department of Children and Family Services. According to Kendall Marlowe, spokesperson for DCFS, the matter probably had not emerged before because openly gay candidates chose agencies that did not have restrictive policies.[41]
 In May 2011 Catholic Charities of Rockford announced that it would halt its foster care and adoption services ""to avoid liability if state law requires them to place children with parents in civil unions — either gay or straight"".[42] In June 2011 Catholic Charities in the dioceses of Springfield, Peoria and Joliet went to court to seek declaratory relief that would protect religious agencies from legal action if they turn away couples in civil unions seeking to adopt. Catholic Charities asked the court's permission to refer civil union couples to other child welfare agencies while continuing to issue licenses to married couples and singles living alone,[43] while adhering to principles that prohibit placing children with unmarried cohabiting couples.[44]
 Following the legalization of same-sex civil unions effective June 1, 2011,[45] Illinois required Catholic Charities, because it accepted public funds, to provide adoption and foster-care services to same-sex couples just as they serviced different-sex couples. When Illinois declined to renew its contracts with Catholic Charities for adoption and foster care services, Catholic Charities closed most of its Illinois affiliates.[44] They had provided such services for 40 years.[46]
 In November 2009, Archbishop Donald Wuerl wrote that he recognized that Washington, D.C., officials were intent on legalizing same-sex marriage, but asked for stronger language to protect individuals and institutions with religious objections to the policy. He wrote that ""Despite the headlines, there has been no threat or ultimatum to end services"" and explained that Catholic Charities had contracts with the District to provide ""homeless services, mental health services, foster care and more.""[47] The law legalizing same-sex marriage passed in December 2009 with the first marriages set to occur on March 9, 2010.[48] Faced with the law's requirements, Catholic Charities in D.C. decided to stop providing health benefits to employees' spouses rather than provide them to married same-sex couples as well. Spouses already enrolled in the plan were not affected.[49]"
Catholic Relief Services	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Relief_Services	"Catholic Relief Services (CRS) is the international humanitarian agency of the Catholic community in the United States. Founded in 1943 by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the agency provides assistance to 130 million people in more than 90 countries and territories in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.
 A member of Caritas International, the worldwide network of Catholic humanitarian agencies, CRS provides relief in emergency situations and helps people in the developing world break the cycle of poverty through community-based, sustainable development initiatives as well as Peacebuilding. Assistance is based solely on need, not race, creed or nationality. Catholic Relief Services is headquartered in the Posner Building in Baltimore, Maryland, while operating numerous field offices on five continents. CRS has approximately 5,000 employees around the world. The agency is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of 13 clergy (most of them bishops) and 10 lay people.[3]
 Initially founded as the War Relief Services, the agency's original purpose was to aid the refugees of war-torn Europe. A confluence of events in the mid 1950s — the end of colonial rule in many countries, the continuing support of the American Catholic community and the availability of food and financial resources from the U.S. Government — helped CRS expand operations. Its name was officially changed to Catholic Relief Services in 1955, and over the next 10 years it opened 25 country programs in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. CRS's executive director during this period (1947–1976) was Bishop Edward E. Swanstrom.[4] One of the key relief workers in those early years was Father Fabian Flynn, CP, who directed their efforts in Germany, Austria, and Hungary.[5]
 As the agency grew, its programming focus widened, adapting to meet the needs of the post-World War II Roman Catholic Church and the circumstances of the people it encountered. In the 1970s and 1980s, programs that began as simple distributions of food, clothing and medicines to the poor evolved toward socio-economic development. By the late 1980s, health care, nutrition education, micro enterprise and agriculture had become major focuses of CRS programming.[citation needed]
 In the mid-1990s, CRS went through a significant institutional transformation. In 1993, CRS officials embarked on a strategic planning effort to clarify the mission and identity of the agency. Soon after, the 1994 massacre in Rwanda – in which more than 800,000 people were killed – led CRS staff to reevaluate how they implemented their relief and development programs, particularly in places experiencing or at high risk of ethnic conflict. After a period of institutional reflection, CRS embraced a vision of global solidarity and incorporated a justice-centered focus into all of its programming, using Catholic social teaching as a guide.[4]
 All programming is evaluated according to a set of social justice criteria called the Justice Lens. In terms of programming, CRS now evaluates not just whether its interventions are effective and sustainable, but whether they might have a negative impact on social or economic relationships in a community.[citation needed]
 CRS programming includes:
promoting human development by responding to major emergencies, fighting disease and poverty and nurturing peaceful and just societies
 Serving Catholics in the United States as they live their faith in solidarity with their brothers and sisters around the world
 Overseas work is done in partnership with local church agencies, other faith-based partners, non-governmental organizations and local governments. CRS emphasizes the empowerment of partners and beneficiaries in programming decisions. Program examples include:
 The agency has also made engaging the U.S. Catholic population a priority. CRS is seeking to help Catholics more actively live their faith and build global solidarity. Program examples include:
 Catholic Relief Services serves as a leading member of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a Washington D.C.-based coalition of over 400 major companies and NGOs that advocates for increased funding of American diplomatic and development efforts abroad.[13]
 As part of the massive, worldwide humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, Catholic Relief Services donated $190 million to fund a five-year relief and reconstruction effort to help 600,000 victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.  CRS provided shelter kits to build tents and temporary shelters, as well as transitional, sturdier shelters meant to last for a longer time.  Some of these efforts have now been codified and made a part of the Sphere Project, an international set of standards to be used by organizations providing emergency assistance.[14]
 Catholic Relief Services has served in Haiti since 1954. Over 50 years of experience allowed CRS to respond to the earthquake immediately and has positioned the agency to be a key development actor as the country rebuilds. The agency works through a broad network of partners, including the Catholic Church in Haiti.[15] These relief efforts are in conjunction with the humanitarian response by other non-governmental organizations.
 CRS is fostering local leadership and helping communities develop the knowledge, understanding and skills to build local capacity so that Haitians drive their own recovery.[16] CRS has committed to a $200 million, 5-year earthquake recovery program in partnership with more than 200 local organizations, focusing on community revitalization and shelter, health, water and sanitation, and protection.[17]
 Highlights of the recovery programming include the $22.5 million reconstruction of St. Francois de Sales Hospital in Port-au-Prince, in partnership with the Catholic Health Association of the United States, turning the facility into a 200-bed teaching hospital; the Catholic Education Initiative, focused on building a vibrant Catholic school system throughout Haiti; and the development of innovative approaches for transforming camps into permanent housing communities, beginning with the construction of 125 housing units at Camp Carradeux.
 Since the civil war in Syria began in March, 2011, CRS has been working with their church partners in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt to provide urgent medical assistance, hygiene and living supplies, counseling and support for the nearly 1 million Syrian refugees who are children. Most now live in unfamiliar and uncomfortable surroundings, unable to attend local schools and traumatized by atrocities they have witnessed. To give them structure and a sense of normalcy, CRS is supporting formal and informal education, tutoring, recreational activities and trauma counseling.
 Though this crisis in the Central African Republic has received little media attention in the United States, an estimated 930,000 people—20 percent of the population—have fled their homes since rebels ousted the president in March 2013. Millions of people are in urgent need of food, shelter and assistance. Although a new president took office in August, many embassies, including the United States, remained closed. Catholic Relief Services and Caritas Mbaiki, Bossangoa, and Bouar are working in the country to provide emergency food, shelter, and agricultural support, as well as supporting the work of Christian and Muslim religious leaders to promote conflict resolution and peace building.
 CRS is a member of the Interfaith Partnership for the Consolidation of Peace (CIPP) in Central African Republic, a joint project launched in 2016 to support the process of national reconciliation and peace building. The CIPP brings together CRS, the Interfaith Peace Platform, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Aegis Trust, Islamic Relief and World Vision International in promoting social cohesion at various levels, supporting economic development and assisting those who have been affected by violence in the country.[18]
 Participating in the humanitarian response to Typhoon Haiyan, in the first 3 months after the typhoon CRS collaborated with communities and Caritas partners to provide 40,000 families–200,000 people–with emergency shelter, clean water and sanitation. We are now focusing on long-term recovery and are committed to a 5-year plan that will help 500,000 people. CRS has spent $23.7 million on their response as of September 30, 2014.[19]  During this first year of relief efforts (2013-2014), CRS rebuilt over 3,000 homes, had 5,000 under construction, and rebuilt 2,800 household latrines.[20]  CRS also created a Livelihood Recovery Program to help all those who lost their jobs because of the disaster.  The program offers locals the choose of five programs and provides grants for training.  The programs are: intercropping, livestock production, aquaculture, small and medium-sized enterprises, skills development, and communal nursery.[20]
 For the humanitarian response to the Nepal earthquake, Catholic Relief Services and its partner organizations have begun procuring emergency relief materials, like shelter kits and sanitation and hygiene materials.[21]"
CBM	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBM_(charity)	"CBM (formerly Christian Blind Mission) is an international Christian development organization, committed to improving the quality of life of people with disabilities in the poorest communities of the world.[1] It is considered one of the world's oldest and largest organizations working in this field.[citation needed] CBM was founded in 1908 by the German pastor Ernst Jakob Christoffel,[2][1] who built homes for blind children, orphans, physically disabled, and deaf persons in Turkey and Iran. Initially CBM's efforts were focused on preventing and curing blindness but now cover other causes of disability.
 CBM targets the people affected by disability by supporting local partner organizations to run programs in the fields of healthcare, rehabilitation (community-based rehabilitation – CBR), education and livelihood opportunities.[3] In 2017 the international mental health charity BasicNeeds merged into the Christian disability charity.[4]
 CBM also advocates for disability inclusion following UN guidelines in international policy-making bodies, and campaigns and raises funds through its member associations. CBM has an emergency response team to respond to conflicts and natural disasters.[5]
 CBM reached more than 38.9 million people in 2015.[6] It supports more than 650 partner-projects in 63 countries and works with various partner organizations, including disabled people's organizations, mission agencies, local churches, self-help groups and relief agencies. It has (as of 2017) 11 member associations in Europe, North America and Oceania, comprising Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Australia,[7] New Zealand, the United Kingdom,[8] Ireland, Kenya, South Africa, the United States[9] and Canada. They have had support of the Canadian government.[10] They have been given a four-out-of-four star rating by Charity Navigator.[11]
 In 2017 CBM was the joint winner (along with Sightsavers) of the 2017 António Champalimaud Vision Award (the world's largest scientific prize in the field of vision) recognizing its work in supporting blindness prevention, alleviation and rehabilitation programs in developing countries.[12][13]"
CCIVS	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCIVS	"The Coordinating Committee for International Voluntary Service (CCIVS) began in its modern form in 1920. The idea was the result of a meeting of a group of Europeans following the First World War (1914-1918). They decided that they had to do something active to try to both deal with the dreadful effects of the war, and find a way to remove the causes of conflict.
 Volunteers from former enemy countries were invited to rebuild a village in France which had been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting. The international group of volunteers built houses and lived together in an international community. Out of this group emerged the idea of Service Civil International.
 After World War II, new organisations sprang up to help reconstruct Europe, both physically and in terms of bringing former enemy populations together. These new organisations needed co-ordination. With the support of the recently established United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the CCIVS was created in 1948.
 Over the following 65 years, CCIVS expanded its membership from a West-European base to include youth movements in Eastern Europe and volunteer organisations in Africa, Asia, Arab countries and the Americas."
Cesvi	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesvi	"Cesvi (Italian, ""cooperazione e sviluppo"", cooperation and development) - one of the biggest humanitarian organizations in Italy. Founded in 1985 and has about 30 offices all over the world.

Child In Need Institute	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_In_Need_Institute	"CINI, or the Child in Need Institute, often known internationally as Child in Need India, is an international humanitarian organisation aimed at promoting ""sustainable development in health, nutrition and education of child, adolescent and woman in need"" in India.[2] The India-based Child In Need Institute is headquartered in Kolkata (Calcutta) and operating in some of the poorest areas in India, whereas its international arm Fondazione CINI International is based in Verona, Italy.
 Founded by pediatrician Samir Chaudhuri in 1974, CINI is involved in several major community development focused projects in India, driving at the underlying social causes of poverty, and collaborates with the Indian government and other local and international NGOs. CINI focuses primarily on the issues of health, nutrition, education and protection of children and mothers. To date its activities have reached around five million people living in the states of West Bengal and Jharkhand. The organisation is also  increasingly involved in projects in other countries within Asia and Africa, in cooperation with both aid organisations and UN agencies.
 CINI shares its approaches with other organisations working in related fields, especially smaller, locally based, community NGOs. CINI has twice been awarded the Indian Government’s National Award for Child Welfare.[3][4]
 CINI has around 1300 employees. Its activities are supported by independent national associations in a number of countries, and by Fondazione CINI International in Italy.[1] CINI cooperates with Save the Children, UNICEF, CARE, the UK Department for International Development, the World Bank, the Indian government and private corporations such as KPMG.
 CINI emerged in part from the work of its founder, Dr. Samir Chaudhuri, who began his medical career working in the villages and slums of West Bengal in the 1970s. His professional collaboration with Sister Pauline Prince, an Australian Loreto nun and nutritionist, and Rev Fr J. Henrichs S. J.,[4] lead to the Child In Need Institute’s foundation in 1974. CINI has gone on to become one of the leading humanitarian NGOs of India.[5]
 In 1998 CINI was recognised as a National Mother NGO, under the Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) program by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India.[6] That same year it was also recognized as a collaborative training institute by the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare (NIHFW), New Delhi,[7] and now constitututes the largest training facility in West Bengal for training health workers in nutrition, safe motherhood and HIV awareness. This training facility was extended from CINI’s own staff training centre to teach workers from other NGOs and government.[8]
 Having grown from humble roots, CINI's work has achieved increasing recognition. The organisation has twice been awarded the National Award of Child Welfare by the Government of India. In 2007, Dr. Chaudhuri received the World of Children Health Award for making ""a significant lifetime contribution to children in the fields of health, medicine or the sciences.""[9]
 A globally focused NGO, Fondazione CINI International, was launched on 1 February 2000 in Verona, Italy. CINI International works to establish North-South and South-South linkages to facilitate sharing and learning among partners working for children, adolescents and women in different parts of the world. Its president is Samir Chaudhuri.
 Independent national associations have been formed in several countries to support CINI's work and/or carry out projects of their own. There are national associations in Australia, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Norway, Uganda, the United States and the United Kingdom, and, additionally, regional associations in Scotland and Wales. The British (UK) association is the largest national association outside India.
 CINI UK was founded by Lady Odile Slynn, whose husband, Lord Slynn of Hadley, was a patron of the organisation. The organisation is now chaired by Rosalind Jarvis. Previous patrons include Nasser Azam, Lord Bilimoria, Cherie Booth, Lord Dholakia, Lady Flather, Lord Puttnam, Sir Mark Tully, Lady Catherine Young, Lord Forsyth
 The CINI UK website is www.cini.org.uk
 CINI Italia is chaired by Eliana Riggio.
 All of CINI’s work aims for the sensitization of the local self-government (the Panchayat) about the health and education needs of the community and the development of effective communication at different levels of the community - especially between the Panchayat and the government health systems.[7]
 ‘Maternal and child under-nutrition have a life-long impact on the health and prospects of the child, potentially affecting future generations’ [11] and India has one of the worst records of malnutrition among its population, despite its recent economic growth.
 CINI’s work tackles malnutrition from the root, focusing on poor maternal nutritional status at conception; low maternal weight gain during pregnancy due to inadequate dietary intake; and short maternal stature due to the mother’s own chronic malnutrition since childhood.[8]
 India accounts for one fifth of maternal deaths globally [12] and the link between underdevelopment, poverty and maternal health has been clear for more than a century according to the Lancet.[13] Though the Department for International Development (DfID) believes the Millennium Development Goal to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters by 2015 remains the greatest challenge,[12] CINI continues to remain active in the field of improving maternal health. Specifically it runs an emergency ward that provides emergency nutrition for the dangerously underweight and counselling for new mothers.
 The urban wing of CINI was launched in 1989, in order to meet the needs of deprived urban children. A critical review of primary education in India in 2004 pointed out that CINI works to improve education, health, and the basic need for survival, protection, growth, and development [14] among slums, squatter colonies, railway platforms and red light areas.
 CINI  has mainstreamed over 10,000 children into formal schools, both residential and non-residential. The majority of these children are from the slums, squatter colonies, railway platforms and red light areas.
 With the creation of the HIV /AIDS unit, CINI has become involved in reducing the increasing magnitude of HIV/AIDS in rural belt of South 24 Parganas district and other parts of West Bengal.
 Community-based HIV/AIDS initiatives of CINI are geared towards minimizing risk behaviors in order to contain the spread of the disease and to ensure better quality of life for HIV/AIDS-infected women, young people and children in a holistic manner through a life-cycle based approach.
 CINI's projects are funded by grants from other aid organisations, international organisations and governments, among them Save the Children, UNICEF, CARE, the UK Department for International Development, the World Bank, the Indian government and various Indian state governments. CINI additionally receives funding from private corporations and individual donors in India and abroad. Its cooperation partners include corporations such as KPMG.[15]
 Around 90% of CINI's funds goes directly into programmes, while the remainder is used for administration and fundraising.[1]
 CINI or its founder and director Samir Chaudhuri have received many awards over the years, including[1]"

Child's Dream Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child%27s_Dream_Foundation	"Child's Dream Foundation is a charitable not-for-profit organization founded by Daniel Siegfried and Marc Jenni in 2003.[1] The foundation is dedicated to empowering marginalised children, youth and communities in the Mekong Sub-Region of Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia.[2] The primary goals of Child's Dream are to enhance the quality of healthcare, to reduce child mortality, construct educational facilities to provide basic education and higher education, and provide scholarship programs and employment opportunities to families and communities.[3] By addressing health, basic education, and higher education, Child's Dream works to minimize poverty by providing socioeconomic opportunities to help improve the future of each person's life. In order to work in different countries, the organization has legal entities in Switzerland, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Hong Kong.[4]
 Siegfried and Jenni worked as private bankers for a global financial services company in Hong Kong and Singapore. While traveling through Asia, they saw firsthand the poverty and inequality that still exists in certain areas and communities. With each trip their desire to take action grew. In 2003 Jenni and Siegfried rented an office in Chiang Mai, Thailand and registered Child's Dream Association as a Swiss charity. Two years later Child's Dream was also registered as a foundation in Thailand.[5] Child's Dream has continued to expand and currently has offices in Thailand, Myanmar, and Cambodia. In 2017 Child’s Dream was officially approved by the Myanmar Government. 
 With Child's Dream, Jenni and Siegfried focus on underprivileged children in the Mekong Sub-Region, an area formerly known for its opium production, corruption, drug trade, and human trafficking. The people living in this region are often exposed to poverty, disease, sexual exploitation, and political persecution. Additionally, this area is home to many refugees and illegal migrants who have no political rights or access to education and healthcare.[6]
 Marc Jenni is head of operations and uses his financial experience to keep the operational costs of Child's Dream as low as possible, while providing maximum transparency to donors. Daniel Siegfried is head of projects and is responsible for project planning and implementation. He is also part of the Project Evaluation Committee (PEC) which prioritizes potential projects, based on viability, local community support and other factors.[7]
 Empowered people responsibly shaping their communities
 Improving health and education for sustainable development
 We design, implement, and partner to support interventions for children and young adults. We address current and future needs in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand related to:
 
Our strategy follows the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.


Our direct goals
 
Our indirect goals
 
 
 Child’s Dream is driven by these Core Values:
 In 2017, 14 percent[8] of donations are spent to improve basic health conditions. Children get dewormed, immunized, and given vitamins. These interventions help to reduce childhood mortality, which is high in remote areas. The Children's Medical Fund provides lifesaving operations to hundreds of critically ill children from Myanmar and Laos who are unable to afford treatment.
In 2017 alone 5792 Children learned about health and hygiene and 4845 community members received drug and awareness education. As of September 2017 Child’s Dream has provided 1498 live saving operations. The targeted support lies with at least 2000 operations by 2020.
 Our focus group Basic Education (BE) represents the core competence of our organisation. This group builds educational facilities, such as primary, secondary and high schools, where children can intellectually thrive, and boarding houses for children from far away villages. We also offer high school and vocational scholarships to underprivileged youth with potential, through our High School & Vocational Scholarship Programme.
 In addition, we improve our basic education facilities by providing computer laboratories, clean water systems, solar systems, playgrounds, life skills training and other extracurricular activities for teachers and students alike. Reducing dropouts is also an intervention we run.
 Higher education (HE) accounts for 34 percent[8] of the project budget. It creates opportunities for employment and income generation, knowledge and skills transfer, as well as community capacity building. The group runs a university scholarship programme and several employment centres for young adults. Child's Dream is also the biggest provider of high school education in refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border. Child's Dream run a social entrepreneurship grant (SEG) scheme that allows graduates of its higher education initiatives to seek funding for social business ventures.
So far 2962 young adults have been trained to become future leaders, 4732 students received vocational training and 385 university students were awarded scholarships. The target for 2020 is to benefit 500 or more students."
Child's Play	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child%27s_Play_(charity)	"Child's Play is a charitable organization that donates toys and games to children's hospitals worldwide. It was founded in 2003 by Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins, authors of the popular video games-related webcomic Penny Arcade. The charity is seen as a way to refute mainstream media's perception of gamers as violent and antisocial.[1] As of 2017, Child's Play had processed $44,538,978 in donations since its inception.[2]
 With the help of hospital staff, Child's Play sets up gift wishlists on Amazon.com, full of video games, books, toys and movies. These wishlists send items directly to the facilities as in-kind donations. Instead of buying items off the wishlists users can donate money through PayPal or check. This money is used to make annual wholesale purchases to provide technology like iPads and Xbox systems as well as games and movies.
 The charity also has a space for corporate sponsors who have donated. The sponsors also earn a corporate sponsorship level (Silver, Gold and Platinum) and get linked back on Childsplaycharity.org. These sponsors include several video game marathons such as the Mario Marathon and Desert Bus for Hope,[3][4] as well as YouTube series such as Far Lands or Bust by Kurtjmac.[5]
 Child's Play was announced on November 24, 2003 by the authors of Penny Arcade as a challenge to their readership, and as a response to the often negative portrayal of video gamers in the media, most notably a HeraldNet article by Bill France entitled ""Violent video games are training children to kill.""[6] (France later made an apology in the same column, praising the effort.[7]) It received positive press on many popular weblogs, including Slashdot and received direct endorsement from Wil Wheaton. In less than one month of publicity and operation, the charity raised over $250,000 in cash and toys for the Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington.[8]
 In 2004, the charity was expanded and partnered with children's hospitals in Seattle; Oakland, California; San Diego, California; Houston, Texas and Washington, D.C.[9]
 By January 5, 2005, when the final numbers for 2004 were tabulated, the charity had raised over $310,000 ($60,000 more than the previous year), and gained forty corporate sponsors in the process. Among these sponsors were Nintendo, Midway Games, Cerulean Studios, and THQ.
 In 2005, the charity was again expanded to partner with an additional seven children's hospitals across the United States, as well as children's hospitals in Toronto and Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is also partnered with Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, England. At the time when they stopped accepting donations, the community had raised $605,000.[10] There was an auction to appear in a Penny Arcade comic strip at the 2005 Child's Play Charity Dinner. The winning bid of $20,000 was placed by Christian Boggs.[11][12] Mr. Boggs also placed the winning bid on an original pencil sketch of the PAX 2005 program cover on eBay. 100% of the profits went to the American Red Cross.
 In 2006, the charity was further expanded, adding four hospitals in the United States, two in Australia, and one in Egypt. In addition to this, on December 13, 2006 there was a charity dinner and auction, where items participants were able to bid on included a gaming day for four in the Penny Arcade office, an appearance in a Penny Arcade strip, a tour of Bungie and recording session for the voice of a character in Halo 3, and a two-year subscription to World of Warcraft and the Burning Crusade special edition signed by all the developers. The year 2006 also became the first time that the 1 million dollar mark was reached.
 In 2007, the charity added a hospital each in Hawaii and New Zealand.
 During the 2008 Penny Arcade Expo, Harmonix announced that three songs from the Expo will be made available for download for the Rock Band video game. The proceeds of these three songs will go to the charity.[13]
 On November 13, 2009, Mike Krahulik announced that after one week, the Child's Play 2009 total had already reached $455,863.80.[14]
 In 2010, Epic Games held a vote-by-purchase event between July 29 and September 6 to determine the fate of a character, Clayton Carmine, in their upcoming game Gears of War 3. Gamers voted by purchasing Xbox avatar T-shirts through Xbox live, or real life T-shirts at the San Diego Comic-Con, with all purchases counting towards the vote.[15] The voting campaign raised over $150,000, all of which was donated to Child's Play.[16]
 In 2011, Mike Krahulik announced the first annual Child's Play Invitational Golf Tournament to be held at the Brookside Golf Course in Pasadena, California on June 5, 2011.  All proceeds from the event go to the partner hospitals & facilities in the Child's Play network.[17] The Golf Tournament was subsequently held at Angeles National Golf Course in Sunland, CA on June 8, 2012[18] and Inglewood Golf Club in Kenmore, WA on May 20, 2013.[19]
 In November 2013, Program Coordinator Jamie Dillion announced the first ever expansion of Child's Play to benefit children in domestic violence facilities.[20] The program was announced as a pilot and is scheduled to expand to open applications in Spring 2014. The shelter program will provide a pre-built game cart with game system, television, and games and will serve emergency shelters, long term shelters, advocacy centers and more.[20]
 In 2016, the charity raised over $160k at their Annual Dinner Auction, provided nearly 30 grants to libraries, shelters, schools, trauma centers, transitional housing, day programs and more to help them purchase games and systems. Also helped supply VR setups to hospitals for therapy and distraction along with iPads to special education classrooms and inpatient psychiatric units.[21]
 In November 2017, former Program Coordinator Jamie Dillion posted on her tumblr a list of problems she has with the way the charity is currently being run, mainly around the lack of transparency of how donations are being spent and a lack of annual totals being announced since 2014.[22] This post was acknowledged by a current Child's Play staff member during the live stream of Desert Bus For Hope 2017, but only provided the information that they have a blog post planned for when they aren't busy.[23] However, in 2018, GuideStar awarded the charity a platinum level award for transparency, indicating that they have improved their communication of their grants[24]"
Children at Risk	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_at_Risk	"CHILDREN AT RISK is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that drives change for children through research, education, and influencing public policy. Founded in 1989 in Houston, Texas and with an office opened in North Texas in 2011, the organization focuses on the well-being of children and educates legislators on the importance of key children's issues. While focusing on a variety of issues, the primary issues are human trafficking, food insecurity, education, and parenting.[1][2] CHILDREN AT RISK also has a North Texas office in Dallas.[3] Some of CHILDREN AT RISK's previous primary issues were juvenile justice, mental health, and Latino children.
 The mission is to improve the quality of life for children through strategic research, public policy analysis, education, collaboration, and advocacy. The organization strives to make children's needs a priority and to ensure ample resources are available for children and their families to thrive.[4]
 Children At Risk began in the fall of 1989 when a group of child advocates met to discuss the lack of documentation on the status of children and the absence of strong public policy support for Houston's children.  For over twenty years, Children At Risk has been speaking out and driving change on behalf of our city's most defenseless youth, led by its original mission ’’To serve as the voice for children.’’ Using the tools of advocacy, Children At Risk works on a broad range of children's issues, including child welfare, education, child trafficking, juvenile justice, mental and physical health, and parenting.  Their efforts are focused where they are needed most: where a significant number of children are affected, and where they can enhance, but not duplicate, the work of others.
 Over its history, Children At Risk has evolved from an organization researching the multitude of obstacles our children face, to one that also drives macro-level change to better the future of our state through community education, collaborative action, evidence-based public policy, and advocating for our youth at the local and state level.  Through its Public Policy & Law Center—established in 2006 as the only center of its kind in Texas—Children At Risk uses policy and legal expertise as a powerful tool to drive change and create a better future for our children.  In recent years, Children At Risk has grown exponentially in its capacity to speak out and drive change for Texas's children and has become the premier resource on children's issues among major media outlets, public officials, and the non-profit sector. In addition, the organization has significantly strengthened its voice in the community through a weekly radio show, regular appearances on television and radio broadcasts, and partnerships with newspapers.
 Having witnessed a need for policy changes in the area of human trafficking, Children At Risk has worked with public officials at the state capitol to strengthen the anti-trafficking laws in Texas since 2007.  In addition, Children At Risk has worked collaboratively with others to launch a broad educational and outreach campaign to combat human trafficking.[5]
 To raise awareness on child trafficking in Texas, Children At Risk' has:
 Children At Risk researched, drafted, and helped to pass several key pieces of legislation to strengthen the laws surrounding human trafficking.  As a result, Texas law has:
 Children At Risk continues to research and draft legislation following recommendations from Shared Hope International.
 Children At Risk has proposed that the Texas Legislature require schools with student populations of 80% or more living at or below 185% of the federal poverty level to provide free school breakfast to all interested students. The 80% threshold is useful as it allows school districts to utilize the “severe need’’ designation and receive a higher federal reimbursement rate per student meal. Schools that serve 60% or more of their meals at a free or reduced price are classified as “severe need”. This threshold also allows economies of scale to lower the per-meal cost provided to students, due to the higher volume of meal production and consumption. In the 2010 school year, all “severe need” schools received the following federal reimbursement:  $0.26 for each paid breakfast, $1.76 for each free breakfast and $1.46 for each reduced-price breakfast. The price of breakfast for students varies across the state from 20 cents for reduced price meals to $1.25 for full price.
 Using a combination of research, analysis, and public policy,  the Public Education team at CHILDREN AT RISK works to raise awareness about underperforming charter schools in Houston. While Children At Risk has recognized charter schools like KIPP and YES Prep among the top ten public schools in the city of Houston, clusters of low-performing charters are consistently found at the bottom of the annual public school rankings. The policy team at CHILDREN AT RISK is committed to ensuring that high-quality charter schools proliferate and that low-performing charters are held accountable.
 The purpose of Children At Risk's school rankings is to both provide a tool to parents and students regarding the quality of local schools and to give information to campuses and districts on how they perform relative to their peers. To evaluate the performance of public schools across the state, Children At Risk examines sixteen indicators at the high school level, twelve at the middle school level, and sixteen at the elementary level.
 Children At Risk ranks schools across the state of Texas and Alabama.
 The Center for Parenting and Family Well-Being advocates to change the way parent education and child abuse prevention is approached in the greater Houston community through prevention and population-based strategies. The Center believes that organizations across different sectors should come together to create an infrastructure that strives to provide all parents in the Houston metropolitan area with effective and accessible parent education. The Center for Parenting and Family Well-Being does not provide direct services. Instead, it collaborates with and supports organizations that provide direct services to ensure that the infrastructure, policies, and partnerships are in place to improve the availability of evidence-based parent education.
 The Juvenile Justice system should be ensuring public safety and rehabilitating juveniles by implementing evidence-based programs in order to reduce further criminal behavior and to help juveniles flourish into productive citizens. Children At Risk has started numerous initiatives to ensure that the rights of juvenile delinquents in the Texas and Houston are not being infringed upon. Children At Risk has helped establish mental health and drug courts and attempted to reduce adult certifications and misdemeanor Class C ticketing.
 Children At Risk conducted the first independent evaluation of the four Juvenile Mental Health Courts in Texas. The report provided a comparison of quality, cost, and effectiveness of services compared to incarceration, best practices utilized and methods of creation and expansion to provide a road map for counties to establish or improve current juvenile mental health courts. The research has provided needed data for child advocates to maintain or increase funding for community-based mental health services.
 Children At Risk also hosted two events, in Dallas and Houston, to educate community members on the topic of Juvenile Mental Health. This brought together mental health experts, state and local stakeholders, community members, advocates, and school representatives to discuss Juvenile Mental Health.
 Children At Risk drafted and advocated for a bill to increase the time for reviewing juveniles in order for the decision to try them as adults to be better informed. When children are unnecessarily transferred to adult courts they frequently suffer more than if they were tried as juveniles.
 Class C tickets are often issued in schools for behavioral problems such as disturbing class or skipping school. Misdemeanor charges are harsh penalties for such minor issues. Children At Risk is working to reduce the prevalence of Class C ticketing in schools by conducting interviews with students, parents, and teachers, and collaborating with key organizations working on the issue across the state of Texas.
 Children At Risk also encourages greater focus on the unique needs of Latino children across all sectors, including fostering greater academic focus through the first edition of its online, open-access, peer-reviewed Journal of Applied Research on Children.

Children in Need	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_in_Need	"BBC Children in Need (also promoted as Plant Mewn Angen in Wales[1]) is the BBC's UK charity. Since 1980 it has raised over £1 billion for disadvantaged children and young people in the UK.[2]
 One of the highlights is an annual telethon, held in November and televised on BBC One and BBC Two from 7:30 pm until 2:30 am. ""Pudsey Bear"" is BBC Children in Need's mascot, whilst Sir Terry Wogan was its long-standing host for 35 years. A prominent annual event in British television, Children in Need is one of three high profile British telethons. It is the only charity belonging to the BBC, the other telethons being Red Nose Day and Sport Relief, both supporting Comic Relief.
 Following the temporary closure of Television Centre, the telethon broadcasts take place at the BBC Elstree Centre.[3]
 The BBC's first broadcast charity appeal took place in 1927, in the form of a five-minute radio broadcast on Christmas Day.[4] It raised about £1,342, which equates to about £69,950 by today's standards, and was donated to four children's charities.[4] The first televised appeal took place in 1955 and was called the Children's Hour Christmas Appeal, with the yellow glove puppet Sooty Bear and Harry Corbett fronting it. The Christmas Day Appeals continued on TV and radio until 1979.[4] During that time a total of £625,836 was raised. Terry Wogan first appeared during this five-minute appeal in 1978, and again in 1979.[4] Sometimes cartoon characters such as Peter Pan and Tom and Jerry were used.
 In 1980, the first Children in Need telethon was broadcast. It was a series of short segments linking the evening's programming instead of the usual continuity. It was devoted to raising money exclusively destined for charities working with children in the United Kingdom. The new format, presented by Terry Wogan, Sue Lawley and Esther Rantzen, saw a dramatic increase in public donations: £1 million was raised that year. The format was developed throughout the 1980s to the point where the telethon segments grew longer and the regular programming diminished, eventually being dropped altogether from 1984 in favour of a single continuous programme. This format has grown in scope to incorporate further events broadcast on radio and online. As a regular presenter, Wogan had become firmly associated with the annual event, continuing to front it until 2014. This was because in the following year, he started to battle ill health from which he died in 2016.
 In 1988, BBC Children in Need became a registered charity (number 802052) in England and Wales, followed by registration in Scotland (SC039557) in 2008.
 An award called the Sir Terry Wogan Fundraiser of the Year has been presented since 2016 to someone who has gone above and beyond to help raise money for Children in Need. The award was set up by Terry's family and was presented by Terry's son, Mark, at the 2016 telethon in memory of the late Sir Terry Wogan. Joanna Lumley awarded it to Ellie and Abbie Holloway during the 2017 telethon.
 The telethon features performances from many top singers and groups, with many celebrities also appearing on the 6 1/2 hour long programme performing various activities such as sketches or musical numbers. Featured celebrities often include those from programmes on rival network ITV, including some appearing in-character, and/or from the sets of their own programmes. A performance by BBC newsreaders became an annual fixture. Stars of newly opened West End musicals regularly perform a number from their show later in the evening after ""curtain call"" in their respective theatres big bombs.
 The BBC devotes the entire night's programming on its flagship channel BBC One to the Children in Need telethon, with the exception of 35 minutes at 10 o'clock while BBC News at Ten, Weather and Regional News airs, and activity continues on BBC Two with special programming, such as Mastermind Children in Need, which is a form of Celebrity Mastermind, with four celebrities answering questions on a chosen subject and on general knowledge. In recent years, before the telethon itself, the BBC has broadcast Children in Need specials including DIY SOS The Big Build, Bargain Hunt, The One Show, in which hosts Matt Baker and Alex Jones did a rickshaw challenge and a celebrity version of Pointless in which Pudsey assists hosts Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman.
 Unlike the other BBC charity telethon Comic Relief, Children in Need relies a lot on the BBC regions for input into the telethon night. The BBC English regions all have around 5–8-minute round-ups every hour during the telethon. This does not interrupt the schedule of items shown from BBC Television Centre as the presenters usually hand over to the regions, giving those in the main network studio a short break. However BBC Scotland, BBC Wales and BBC Northern Ireland opted out of the network schedule with a lot of local fundraising news and activities from their broadcast area. Usually they went over to the network broadcast at various times of the night, and usually they showed some network items later than when the English regions saw them. This was to give the BBC nations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a much larger slot than the BBC English regions because the ""nations"" comprise a distinct audience of the BBC. Usually BBC Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland handed back to network coverage from around 1:00 am on the telethon night. For the 2010 appeal this changed, with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales deciding not to have their usual opt-outs and instead following the English regions' pattern of having updates every hour.
 The mascot which fronts the Children in Need appeal is called Pudsey Bear. He was created and named in 1985 by BBC graphic designer Joanna Lane, who worked in the BBC's design department. Asked to revamp the logo, with a brief to improve the charity's image, Lane said ""It was like a lightbulb moment for me, We were bouncing ideas off each other and I latched on to this idea of a teddy bear. I immediately realised there was a huge potential for a mascot beyond the 2D logo"".[48] The bear was named after her hometown of Pudsey, West Yorkshire, where her grandfather was mayor.[48] A reproduction of the bear mascot (made of vegetation) is in Pudsey park, near the town centre. Originally introduced for the 1985 appeal, Pudsey Bear was created as a triangular shaped logo, depicting a yellow-orange teddy bear with a red bandana tied over one eye. The bandana had a pattern of small black triangles. The mouth of the bear depicted a sad expression. The lettering ""BBC"" appeared as 3 circular black buttons running vertically down the front of the bear, one capital letter on each, in white. Perpendicular to the buttons, the words ""children-in-need"" appeared in all lower case letters along the base of the triangular outline. Accessibility for young readers, and people with disabilities including speech and reading challenges, were factors weighed by the designer Joanna Ball, specifically the ""P"" sound in ""Pudsey"" name, and the choice of all lower case sans serif letters for the logotype.
 The original design was adapted for various applications for use in the 1985 appeal, both 2D graphics and three-dimensional objects. Items using the original 1985 design included a filmed opening title sequence, using cartoon cell animation, a postage stamp, and a prototype soft toy, commissioned from a film and TV prop maker (citation). The original prototype soft toy was orange and reflected the design of the logo, which was then adapted for approximately 12 identical bears, one for each regional BBC Television Studio. These bears were numbered and tagged with the official logo and auctioned off as part of the appeal.  The number 1 Pudsey Bear was allocated to the Leeds region. Joanna Lumley appeared with one of the soft toys during the opening of Blackpool Illuminations and named Pudsey Bear as the official mascot of the BBC Children in Need appeal.
 In 1986, the logo was redesigned. Whilst retaining the concept of a teddy bear with a bandana over one eye, all other elements were changed. Specifically, the triangular elements of the underlying design were abandoned, as well as the corporate identity colour scheme was changed. The new bandana design was white with red spots, one of the buttons was removed and the logotype now appeared as building blocks, which spelled out ""BBC CHILDREN IN NEED"" in capital letters. Pudsey now has a smiling expression on his face rather than a sad one like the previous logo.
 In 2007, Pudsey and the logo were redesigned again. This time, Pudsey's bandana had multicoloured spots, and all of the buttons were removed. By 2009, Pudsey had been joined by another bear, a brown female bear named ""Blush"". She has a spotty bow with the pattern similar to Pudsey's bandana pattern. In 2013, Moshi Monsters introduced Pudsey as an in-game item for 100 Rox.
 The Children in Need 2015 campaign on 13 November 2015 marked the thirtieth birthday of Pudsey Bear, who has been the charity's mascot since 1985.
 Notes:
 In November 2006, Intelligent Giving published an article about Children in Need, which attracted wide attention across the British media. The article, titled ""Four things wrong with Pudsey"", described donations to Children in Need as a ""lazy and inefficient way of giving"" and pointed out that, as a grant-giving charity, Children in Need would use donations to pay two sets of administration costs. It also described the quality of some of its public reporting as ""shambolic"".[64][65]
 In 2007, it was reported that presenter Terry Wogan had been receiving an annual honorarium since 1980 (amounting to £9,065 in 2005). This made him the only celebrity paid for his participation in Children in Need. According to Wogan's account,  that he would ""quite happily do it for nothing"" and had ""never asked for a fee"". The BBC stated that the amount, which was paid from BBC resources rather than from the Children in Need charity fund, had ""never been negotiated"", having instead increased in line with inflation.[66] Two days before the 2007 event, it was reported that Wogan had waived his compensation.[67]
 There has been concern about the type of groups receiving funding from Children in Need. Writing in The Spectator, Ross Clark noted that funding goes towards controversial groups such as Women in Prison, which campaigns against jailing female criminals. Another charity highlighted was the Children's Legal Centre, which provided funding for Shabina Begum to sue her school as she wanted to wear the jilbāb. Clark pondered whether donors seeing cancer victims on screen would appreciate ""that a slice of their donation would be going into the pockets of Cherie Blair to help a teenage girl sue her school over her refusal to wear a school uniform"".[68]
 A former BBC governor has revealed that Jimmy Savile was kept away from Children In Need in recent years though he was on the show in earlier years. Sir Roger Jones who was also chairman of the charity says he had suspicions about Jimmy Savile a decade ago before the news of Jimmy Savile's sexual abuse scandal came to public light in 2012. His comments came on the day an inquiry into whether the British Broadcasting Corporation's child protection and whistle-blowing policies are acceptable began.[69]"
Children International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_International	"Children International is a global nonprofit humanitarian organization that helps children break the cycle of poverty.[4] It addresses children’s critical needs through early intervention and regular interaction in community centers.[5] The goal is to help children overcome the effects of poverty, support their education, and prepare youth to contribute to society.[6]
 The organization provides health benefits, such as annual medical exams and care during illness. If a child needs more advanced health intervention, the organization assists in providing referrals to specialists.[7] Beyond these critical needs, Children International provides nutritional support, dental care, counseling for children and families, school supplies and fees, clothing, and items for the home.[8] It also engages youth through leadership development opportunities, scholarships, and financial and job-skills training.[9] An example of youth programming is ""Into Employment,"" where participating youth receive training in welding, electrical, refrigeration and industrial mechanics.[10] Youth may also take courses on sales techniques, customer service, accounting, critical thinking and leadership.[11] The international hotel chain InterContinental is one business working with the charity to provide job skills training for youth in Mexico.[12] Children International has also worked with the Starwood Foundation to help youth prepare for jobs in the hospitality industry.[13]
 Children International ran other notable programs including a school feeding program in Zambia.[14] With support from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,[15] Children International offered a global community literacy program. The charity has been recognized for giving out books in the Philippines,[16] Kenya,[17] and Malawi.[18] The organization also hosted reading tents in Uganda.[19][20]
 Children International has engaged in humanitarian aid after disasters. They provided assistance in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan, distributing personal care supplies,[21] and clothing, food, water and other relief.[22] Children International also pledged to assist the recovery effort with rebuilding and other aid.[23]
 According to the Children International website, the organization's goal is to graduate healthy, educated, empowered and employed young adults from their program so they can achieve the goal of breaking the cycle of poverty.[5]  The organization delivers these results via its community centers, which offer programs, computers, libraries and other educational tools.[24] Educational support of this kind is frequently absent or difficult to acquire in impoverished areas, leading to secondary illiteracy and educational lags.[25]  Community centers serve as a distribution network for aid, although the focus is on using each center as ""a unique support system"" that offers skill and leadership training, college preparation and confidence building.[24] Children International has indicated that its interests lie in cross-sector work with private industry, local and national governments, individuals and other non-governmental organizations.[26] 
Children International uses a child sponsorship model to fund these activities, with nearly all of its funding coming from private donations.[27] Funds are transferred to each agency, which oversee the organization’s community centers, according to an approved budget.
 Known in its earlier years as ""Holy Land Christian Mission,"" Children International was founded in 1936.[28]  The organization distributed food baskets to widows and poor families, provided early childhood education[29] and operated a small medical clinic as well as a children’s home for orphans. This clinic was expanded following a polio outbreak in 1952 and became larger and more sophisticated over the years.[30] Eventually known as the Mt. David Crippled Children’s Hospital, the clinic provided critical orthopedic medical services[31] until its closure.
 In the 1980s, the organization began expanding its scope by launching sponsorship agencies in Guatemala, Colombia, Honduras and the Dominican Republic.[32] It would later change its name to Children International.[33]
 Children International is currently a secular organization which supports equal participation for all children regardless of religion.[34] The organization operates in 10 countries, including Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Mexico, the Philippines, the United States and Zambia.[35]
 Singer and longtime CI supporter Debbie Gibson was featured as a contestant on the 2012 season of The Celebrity Apprentice on NBC. From the show, she raised $50,000 for CI[36] and her winnings went towards the construction of a community center to serve 5,000 poor children in New Delhi, India. The community center will include a medical and dental clinic, pharmacy, library, computer lab and playground. The center will allow impoverished children to receive much-needed health care and educational support they would not have otherwise.[37] In 2014, Gibson again demonstrated her support for the organization by donating proceeds from her appearance on the television show “Celebrity Home Raiders” to them.[38]
 In addition to Debbie Gibson, Children International has a dedicated base of celebrity supporters who have graciously agreed to lend their names and faces in support of bringing real and lasting change to families around the world.

 With the support of USAID, Children International launched A Ganar, a work training program in Guatemala in early 2014.[45] Previously, the charity piloted a program with USAID/Colombia called Hope for Colombia’s Children that trained youth in conflict resolution.[32] The two organizations have also distributed books together in the Philippines.[33]
 Children International has worked with the U.S. Peace Corps in a number of countries. The organization has trained Peace Corps volunteers in Guatemala,[46]  and has worked on several water-related projects in the Philippines, including a sanitation project[47] and installation of water pumps.[48] In 2014, the organizations co-authored a comprehensive youth leadership training manual titled “Leadership Training through Project Design and Management.” [49]
 Children International assisted the United Nations on its global campaign The World We Want. The UN recognized the organization’s efforts to include poor children’s opinions in the effort.[50]
 Children International began its partnership with Aflatoun in 2010, when it implemented its programs in three countries: Ecuador, India and the Philippines.[51] Children International has since expanded Aflatoun to its sponsorship areas, including Colombia,[52] and Honduras.[53][54] In November 2013, Children International launched the first Aflatoun program in the United States at its Little Rock, Arkansas, location.[55]
 In 2012, sponsored child Carla Vasquez from Guayaquil, Ecuador, was awarded the Youth Champion Award in Geneva, Switzerland, by Child and Youth Finance.[56] In 2013, Children International had two children, one from Ecuador and one from India, qualify as finalists with their Aflatoun projects at the 2013 Child and Youth Finance Summit in Istanbul, Turkey.[57]
 Children International has been a TOMS Giving Partner since 2013.[58] As part of their One-for-One shoe program, TOMS Shoes worked with Children International to distribute shoes in a Philippine community hard hit by Typhoon Haiyan.[59]

 Children International has worked with Clean the World to distribute soap and hygiene products to people in need. [76]
 In May 2014, Children International started withdrawing its operations from Chile. Letters were sent to sponsors of Children in Chile informing them that their sponsorship of the child had come to an end and assigning them a new child to sponsor in another country.
Children International claims that the reason for their pull-out is that the situation in Chile has improved to the point where they are not needed as the economy is improving and the government is taking care of the healthcare and education needs of the impoverished. Children International had three service centers in Chile, serving over 17000 children, all of which are being closed.[citation needed]"
Children of Peace International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Peace_International	"Children of Peace International (COPI) is a humanitarian non-profit organization aiming to serve the charity projects in Vietnam and help developing the capability of the people to help themselves.[1][2] Children were the beginning and still are the primary focus for aid efforts of COPI.
 The organization was founded in 1993 by Binh Rybacki, a Vietnamese native, who fled from Saigon with her family in 1975 and settled in the United States.  Coming back to Vietnam as translator for a group of doctors in 1993, Binh Rybacki was deeply moved by seeing children working there as street peddlers and prostitutes.  So she decided to find the ways for helping to improve the lives of these kids and created Children of Peace International.
 In 2002 Binh Rybacki and COPI were awarded World Service Medal by Kiwanis International.
 The organization is based in Loveland, Colorado.[3]
 At present, COPI has the following programs in Vietnam:"
Children's Defense Fund	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Defense_Fund	"The Children's Defense Fund (CDF) is an American 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that focuses on child advocacy and research. It was founded in 1973 by Marian Wright Edelman.[1]
 The CDF was founded in 1973, citing inspiration from the Civil Rights Movement, with the goal of improving federal policies concerning child welfare and public education systems.[2][3]
 CDF is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and has offices in several states around the country: California, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. CDF programs operate in 28 states.[citation needed]
 Since its founding, the CDF has lobbied for passing legislation related to its goals including the Education for All Handicapped Children Act[2] in 1975 (now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) and the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act in 1980. Its legislative interests have also included Head Start, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Child Income Tax Credit.[2]
 The CDF has run several public awareness campaigns, including the Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Campaign in 1986[4], the gun violence prevention campaign, and ending child poverty.
 The CDF's programs include a modern Freedom Schools program launched in 1993 for child enrichment through reading,[5][6] a Beat the Odds program launched in 1990 that hosts awareness events and awards partial college scholarships,[3][7] and a Youth Advocacy Leadership Training fund.[citation needed]
 In recent years, CDF funds generated numerous child advocacy reports. These reports range in topic, from ending child poverty and minority incarceration rates (and the school to prison pipeline) to gun safety concerning children.[8][8][9]
 In 2008, the CDF was among the charities receiving donations from the ""Idol Gives Back"" televised fundraising event.[10]
 Numerous notable individuals have been actively involved with the charity. Reese Witherspoon served on the Board of Directors.[11] J.J. Abrams has funded CDF Freedom Schools in the past.[3]"

 It initially received its funding as donations from The Children's Investment Fund Management which manages the London‐based hedge fund, The Children's Investment Fund founded by Chris Hohn in 2003.[4][5][6] Coinciding with the couple's divorce proceedings, changes set in motion in 2012 led to the splitting up of the fund and the foundation. The fund no longer donates money to the foundation on a contractual basis, though it may do so on a discretionary basis.[7]
 Jamie Cooper-Hohn managed CIFF until 2013 when Michael Anderson was appointed Chief Executive Officer.[8] The CEO is now Kate Hampton .[9]
 CIFF focuses on improving the lives of children living in poverty in developing countries. Its main areas of activity are children and mothers' health and nutrition, children's education and welfare and smart ways to slowdown and stop climate change.[10]  In health, the areas of focus are survival of newborns, prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV/AIDS and deworming.  Within nutrition, these are the treatment of severe acute malnutrition and the reduction of stunting. In education, CIFF works on early learning (or pre-primary.)  Cleaner (or reduced carbon emission) energy systems and lower carbon emitting and higher resource efficient urbanisation are the areas of priority of CIFF to address climate change.[10]
 Some of the grants CIFF made in 2014 include:
 In 2013, CIFF committed to spend $787 million over 7 years to tackle malnutrition.  This was part of a total pledge of $4.1 billion towards reducing malnutrition announced at the Nutrition for Growth summit in London, co-hosted by the United Kingdom, Brazil and CIFF.[15]
 In 2012, CIFF was one of the signatories of the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, a WHO inspired collaborative disease eradication programme of 10 neglected tropical diseases.[16]
 The Clinton Foundation lists CIFF among 7 organisations from which it received more than US$25 million.[17]"
Children's Liver Disease Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Liver_Disease_Foundation	"Children's Liver Disease Foundation (CLDF) is a UK charity taking action against the effects of childhood liver disease, providing information, emotional support, research funds and a voice for all affected.
 CLDF was founded in 1980 by the parents of a little boy named Michael McGough, who died before be could receive a liver transplant.  The name was later changed to Children’s Liver Disease Foundation.
 Today the charity works in four main areas, support of families and young people affected by childhood liver disease, funding medical and social research into all aspects of childhood liver disease and education, providing educational services to the general public and the medical profession and providing a voice for all affected by childhood liver disease. The charity works closely with the three UK specialist paediatric liver centres: Birmingham Children’s Hospital, King’s College Hospital, London and Leeds General Infirmary.
 CLDF provides support to families and young people affected by childhood liver disease, including an ‘on-call’ telephone and email service and face to face meetings with parents and young people at hospitals and clinics. 
 The charity has also developed a range of literature for families, young people and healthcare professionals.  CLDF’s literature series includes a medical series, with leaflets on the main liver diseases affecting children (biliary atresia, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Wilson's disease etc.)  CLDF has also produced a nutrition series,  a  support series for families and information written especially for children and young people.  CLDF also provides the paediatric liver transplant units with a series of leaflets on transplantation to accompany the paediatric liver transplant programme.
 CLDF’s prolonged jaundice awareness campaign, Yellow Alert aims to promote the early identification and appropriate referral of babies with prolonged jaundice – a sign of possible liver disease."
Children's Miracle Network Hospitals	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Miracle_Network_Hospitals	"Children's Miracle Network Hospitals (CMN Hospitals) (French: Réseau Enfants-Santé (RES)) is a North American non-profit organization that raises funds for children's hospitals, medical research, and community awareness of children's health issues. The organization, founded in 1983 by Marie Osmond, John Schneider, Mick Shannon, and Joe Lake, is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. The current President and CEO of Children's Miracle Network Hospitals is John Lauck. To date, Children's Miracle Network Hospitals claims to have raised more than US$4.7 billion which is distributed directly to a network of 170 hospitals.
 Children's Miracle Network Hospitals raises money each year to donate to children's health issues.[2] The funds are raised in part by corporate partners, like Walmart, Ace Hardware, Sam's Club, Costco Wholesale, Wawa, RE/MAX, IHOP and Love's Travel Stops  throughout the United States and Canada. There are 170 children's hospitals affiliated with Children's Miracle Network Hospitals in the United States and Canada. The funds raised by Children's Miracle Network Hospitals flow through directly to participating hospitals. Children's Miracle Network Hospitals' primary fund raising efforts are corporate fundraising campaigns with more than 80 corporate partners.
 In addition, Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and many of its member hospitals hold an annual telethon every first weekend in June known nationally as A Celebration of Real Miracles, hosted by Osmond and Schneider, with local cut-ins. The telethon is presented on various television stations in the United States and Canada with local segments varying from station to station. In Quebec, the TVA network produces its own French-language telethon, Opération Enfant-Soleil, held the same weekend as its English-language counterparts; though it does not use any of CMNH's segments, the telethon and the organization is part of the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.
 Many universities host annual Dance Marathon events to support Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and other local children hospitals. These events collectively raise millions of dollars to support Children's Miracle Network Hospitals services, such as the Indiana University Dance Marathon which raised $2,622,123.21 in 2013 for the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, Indiana.[3]
 The Miss America Organization has made Children's Miracle Network its national platform. All girls competing at local, state, and national levels, are required to raise money in order to participate.
 Corning Federal Credit Union, Love's Travel Stops, Costco, CDW, Delta Air Lines, Publix, Rite Aid, Dairy Queen, IHOP, Sigma Chi, Delta Zeta, Domino Sugar, Phi Mu, Speedway, Phi Delta Epsilon, Phi Kappa Theta, Zeta Beta Tau, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, McGraw-Hill Federal Credit Union, and Marriott International are some of the corporate partners that support Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. As of August 2013, RE/MAX and RE/MAX agents have donated more than $123,000,000 to CMN.
 Another great contributor to the Children's Miracle Network is Extra Life, which unites thousands of players around the world in a 24-hour gaming marathon to support Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. Since its inception in 2008, Extra Life has raised more than $40 million for local CMN Hospitals.[4]
 Various agencies evaluate charities, based on a number of factors, including the percent of their revenue that is actually spent on their charitable programs. Children's Miracle Network Hospitals receives a 3-star (out of 4) rating from Charity Navigator, with 89.2% of their revenue going to program expenses."

Church World Service	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_World_Service	"Church World Service (CWS) was founded in 1946 and is a cooperative ministry of 37 Christian denominations and communions, providing sustainable self-help, development, disaster relief, and refugee assistance around the world. The CWS mission is to eradicate hunger and poverty and to promote peace and justice at the national and international level through collaboration with partners abroad and in the US.
 CWS program areas mainly target education and advocacy, both of which are essential components in confronting the root causes of hunger. By raising awareness about hunger, poverty, water access, trade, human rights, climate change, peace building and other issues in its Speak Out alerts, CWS brings the voices and priorities of its partners and constituents into the halls of churches, community groups, and governments.
 Disaster Response[1]
 When disaster strikes, CWS works with partners on the scene to provide shelter, food and water, blankets, recovery kits, counseling – the basics needed to ensure the survival of individuals and communities at risk.  In addition to rapid emergency disaster response, CWS also provides long-term development initiative, helping vulnerable families and communities prepare for and recover from natural and human-caused calamities. For example, in drought-ridden Ethiopia, CWS and partners are assisting 120,000 people with food and seeds to restart farming activities.
 In the United States, when disaster strikes, CWS dispatches disaster response specialists where needed in order to provide assistance to local interfaith groups assessing and responding to the material and spiritual needs of their communities. After Hurricanes Ike and Gustav hit the U.S. Gulf Coast, CWS reached out to its network of long-term recovery groups for project development support and also for provision of material resources such as CWS Blankets and Kits.  Since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, CWS has partnered with Habitat for Humanity and has invested in building long-term recovery capacity along the Gulf Coast. As a result of this collaboration more than 640 houses were repaired or rebuilt in the targeted area of the Gulf Coast.
 Assisting Refugees[2]
 CWS helps meet the needs of refugees in protracted situations and those who are able to return home. It also serves tens of thousands of refugees, immigrants, and asylum seekers in the U.S. and around the world each year with screening for potential resettlement to the U.S., chaplaincy, legal, and other professional services. Working with denominations and congregational co-sponsors, CWS and its network of resettlement affiliates have welcomed and found new homes in the U.S. for more than 450,000 refugees since 1946.
 Immigration[3]
 CWS strongly supports policies that allow illegal immigrants to remain in the United States and argued in 2014 that Congress ""should enact immigration reform that will provide a permanent solution and a path to citizenship for all our undocumented community members."" CWS ""encourages all members of Congress to support the President's actions"" noting that ""the lives of these [illegal immigrant] families will be improved by this action.""
 CROP Hunger Walks[4]
 The largest fund-raising events for Church World Service are CROP Hunger Walks (Christian Rural Overseas Program [1]).  The first CROP Hunger Walk was in the 1960s.  Now more than 2,000 communities across the U.S. join in CROP Hunger Walks each year.  A unique aspect of CROP Hunger Walks is that Church World Service doesn't receive all of the money raised.  Up to 25% of the money donated is given to local hunger fighting agencies which include food banks and community gardens. Additionally, those sponsoring a walker can specify whether Church World Service or an alternative global hunger-fighting agency will receive the remaining 75% of the donation.
 Blankets+[5]
 Through the Blankets+ program, more than 8,000 congregations and groups enable CWS to respond to disasters and assist communities by providing the necessary tools needed to build sustainable lives.
 CWS Kits[6]
 CWS Kits include Hygiene Kits, School Kits, Baby Kits, and Emergency Clean-up Buckets. Last year, with the support of affiliated congregations and religious groups, CWS provided 298,000 Kits in the United States and abroad.
 Church World Service earned a B+ rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy[2] and was also named one of the Top 100 Highly Rated Charities by GiveSpot.com. CWS currently has a 3[3]-star rating from Charity Navigator.[4]
 On August 26, 2009 CWS was part of the 300+ Groups Ask Senate for Stronger Climate Bill letter to Senate."
The Citizens Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Citizens_Foundation	"The Citizens Foundation (TCF) is a non-profit organization, and one of the largest privately owned networks of low-cost formal schools in Pakistan. The Foundation operates a network of 1,567 school units, educating 252,000 students through 12,000 teachers and principals, with over 17,400 employees. Approximately 94% of the Foundation's expenditure is allocated to the Education program.[1]
 The Citizens Foundation (TCF) was established in August 1995. It is a professionally managed charitable organization that builds and runs schools, providing primary and secondary education to boys and girls in rural areas and urban slums of Pakistan. As of April 2018, TCF has expanded its network to 1,567 operational school units, which provide education to 252,000 students.[2] The Economist has called The Citizens Foundation (TCF) ""perhaps the largest network of independently run schools in the world.""[3] The Foundation is the largest private employer of women in Pakistan with an all-female faculty of 12,000 teachers and principals. 88% of TCF alumni have gone to college and 71% are employed.[1]
 TCF maintains a balanced gender ratio; close to 50% of students are female. In order to achieve this goal, TCF exclusively hires female teachers to make parents comfortable with the idea of sending their girls to schools. Each school hires support staff from within the community, who also help convince parents to send their children to school, especially girls.[4]
 Out of the population of 164,741,924 only 82,206,220 people are educated in Pakistan and 24%[5] of the population are below the poverty line.
 Like other developing countries of the world Pakistan also faces the issues of population explosion, poverty, unemployment, income disparity and low literacy rate. In 1995, six successful top-level managers of Pakistan attempted to find a way to solve these problems, and the root cause identified by them was education. Within a few months The Citizens Foundation (TCF) was formed in Karachi.[6]
 Pakistan has the second highest number of out-of-school children in the world, after Nigeria, and it is the world's sixth largest country. To tackle this challenge, the founders of TCF wanted to leverage their experience building companies to build a network of 1,000 schools for the country's poorest, out-of-school children. The group put their own money into a pilot to build 5 schools in Karachi's worst slums that did not have electricity, sanitation, and clean water. With $30 million supporting 252,000 students today, TCF spends less than $12 (€10) per child per month. Less than 10% is spent on administration (curriculum, testing, staff engineers, etc.).
 TCF has evolved a model to deliver quality education in Pakistan's most neglected rural and slum communities where we find children, especially girls, out of school. It is built around the following key elements:
 Whereas most low-cost private schools in Pakistan use English textbooks – a language that teachers and children don't speak – our curriculum is in Urdu and we teach English as a second language. We develop our own textbooks and teachers’ guides drawing from the best materials available internationally but relevant to the exposure of an underprivileged child in Pakistan. Our curriculum is built on 5 Cs: Creativity, Critical Thinking, Conceptual Understanding, Confidence, and Communication.
 The Citizens Foundation provides primary and secondary level education, through which they are trying to bring about a qualitative and quantitative change in the education sector of Pakistan. The students at TCF schools are charged a nominal fee, out of which up to 95% scholarship is awarded along with uniforms and books on a pay-as-you-can-afford basis. This is judged on the basis of the overall household income of each family, its circumstances and education related expenses. Applicants for financial assistance provide necessary details about their family income and resources by completing a scholarship form. TCF school staff, through visits to the applicants' homes, verify this information. School principals then send completed scholarship forms, along with their recommendations to the Regional Office where the final decision is taken. Scholarships are given for one academic year and the recipients are eligible to reapply. Students who are eligible get uniforms and textbooks free of cost.
 TCF operates a network of 722 vans that provide transportation to its faculty in order to facilitate quality staffing in remote areas.[7] Schools are located across Pakistan.[2]
 In order to provide quality education to the students a Teacher Training Center was made in 1997, in Karachi. Every new teacher hired goes through four-weeks of extensive pre-service training before being permitted to teach at a TCF school. The training center closely evaluate the teachers during the year and provide training sessions from time to time as per requirement of the curriculum. The program components are[8]
 TCF has a dedicated Quality Assurance (QA) team to oversee the quality of the Education Programme with the objective of maintaining an education standard in all the TCF School units. Visits are conducted throughout the year to monitor each school's educational activities, formal classroom observations are carried out and insights are collected from Principals, teachers and students to come up with a focused and dedicated school improvement plan.[8] The QA team also conducts centralized examinations.
 In addition to the Education program, TCF also operates some community development programmes through the school premises.
 Aagahi, TCF's adult literacy programme was launched in 2005 as a community development initiative and teaches literacy skills such as reading, writing, and basic math to women from rural areas and urban slums in areas around TCF Schools. In 2017, Aagahi was awarded the UNESCO Confucius Prize for Literacy.[9][10] In Urdu, the word Aagahi stands for ""awareness"".
 Training Centers are established inside TCF school premises where trained teachers impart 6-month specialized training in two specific trades which includes Beauty-Cosmetology and Cutting-Sewing-Embroidery.[11] Participants are taught skills to launch their own small businesses, with the objective of supporting families to lift themselves out of poverty and facilitate sustainable community impact.
 In communities where access to clean water is an issue, TCF opens community-scale filtered water depots.[12][11] One outlet provides clean water to the children attending school while the other is used by the community around the school.
 In 2016, TCF's Strategic Development Unit (SDU) initiated the Government School Program, under which TCF took over operations at 274 adopted government schools.[13] 256 of these schools are in Punjab, 8 in Sindh and 5 in KPK and 5 in Baluchistan.[14] As a result of work on improving conditions at these schools, student enrollment increased from an average of 47 to 101 students per school.[14] In 2017, students from TCF-operated government schools received an average of 72.6% marks in the 5th grade board exam.
 On October 8, 2005 Pakistan witnessed one of the worst natural disasters in its history, the earthquake in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and areas of NWFP. TCF provided earthquake victims with food, blankets and tents. Medical camps were set with adequate operation theatres. Rehabilitation process was started in which first 6,300 shelters were built to help over 60,000 victims[15] survive the harsh winters. Then a layout was made to make permanent houses and Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Authority (ERRA) approved the design of the house.
 TCF also developed a water supply scheme in most villages to provide easy access to water for the people. Previously many people had to walk to the neighboring village to get water in buckets or pots. In the earthquake-affected areas the whole infrastructure was destroyed, many schools collapsed killing thousands of teachers and children. 21 schools will be built by TCF[when?] to help affected children.
 Being a charitable organisation the sole source of income is donations. They receive nearly 80%[16]  of the funds from Pakistanis at home, which include corporate sponsorship and individuals. The rest of the donations are received from expatriate communities. More than 90%[1] of the funds are utilized in the building and running of schools, providing equipment for libraries and science laboratories, children's uniforms, books and snacks. The remaining are allocated for administration costs.
 TCF's accounts are audited by KPMG and available to the public.[1] As of 2018, TCF is assigned a non-profit organization (NPO) governance rating of GR-9+ by JCR-VIS Credit Rating Co Ltd, denoting a high level of governance in TCF.[17]
 TCF has a Shariah scholar on its advisory board to ensure utilization of zakat funds is as per Shariah standards.[18] Accounting for Zakat funds is separate from donation funds. Zakat is only used in operational support funds which are utilized within a year. We do not use Zakat funds on capital expenditures or endowment funds. To ensure children are deserving of Zakat funds, parents take an undertaking confirming they are eligible for Zakat.
 TCF is supported by a global network of Chapters
 TCF has won a number of awards including MAP, and ICAP, South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA) for the best presented annual report.

 Jim Balfanz, President (City Year Boston '94)
 City Year is an American education nonprofit organization founded in 1988 dedicated to helping students and schools succeed. The organization partners with public schools in 29 high-need communities across the US and through international affiliates in the UK and Johannesburg, South Africa. City Year teams are made up of 18 to 24 year olds, who provide student, classroom, and whole school support, intended to help students stay in school and on track to graduate high school. City Year is a member of the AmeriCorps national service network, and is supported by the Corporation for National and Community Service, school district partnerships, and private philanthropy from corporations, foundations and individuals.
 City Year was founded in 1988 by Michael Brown and Alan Khazei, then-roommates at Harvard Law School, who felt strongly that young people in service could be a powerful resource for addressing America's most pressing issues. They built City Year with the conviction that one person can make a difference. Since its inception, City Year has promoted the vision of service as a common expectation – and a real opportunity – for citizens all around the world.
 City Year AmeriCorps members initially focused their efforts on community rehabilitation, beautification of neighborhoods, and developing community awareness in Boston. Over the years, the organization has expanded, opening sites in 28 cities throughout the US, and refocused its mission to help students in under-served schools reach their full potential and graduate from high school.
 Inspired by a visit with City Year during his 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton enlisted the help of Michael Brown, Alan Khazei and others to establish AmeriCorps through the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. Since then, more than 1 million AmeriCorps members have contributed upwards of 1.2 billion hours of public service. All AmeriCorps members, originally conceived as unpaid volunteers in service, are now paid a stipend by the federal government through the Corporation for National and Community Service and subsequently through a variety of matching grants, including the Segal AmeriCorps Education Award. City Year, along with thousands of other nonprofit organizations, is a member of the AmeriCorps network, a program of the Corporation for National and Community Service.[citation needed]
 In early 2005, City Year opened its first international site in South Africa.[2] A second international affiliate, City Year London based in London, England, followed in 2010,[3] with City Year Birmingham and City Year Greater Manchester opening in the U.K. in 2013 and 2015, respectively.
 In 2012, City Year announced its Long Term Impact (LTI) goal to dramatically increase the number of students on track to graduation, reaching the majority of off-track students in each of its communities, and expanding to cities and schools that produce two-thirds of the nation's urban dropouts.[2] Based on national research from Johns Hopkins University and City Year's analysis of existing markets, roughly 15 to 20 percent of schools are producing the majority of the dropouts within urban school districts. This degree of concentration enables City Year AmeriCorps members to have an outsized impact on the graduation pipeline in each of their cities, while deploying to a relatively small number of schools. The goal of the strategy is to significantly increase graduation rates and college and career readiness in high-need urban schools by ensuring that 80 percent of students served by City Year reach the tenth grade on time and on track to graduate. City Year AmeriCorps members function as a ""human capital resource"" in under-resourced elementary, middle and high schools, working with off-track students and students at risk for falling off track to provide targeted academic and social-emotional interventions aimed at improving the number of high school graduates.[citation needed]
 City Year AmeriCorps members commit to 11 months of service, leadership development and civic engagement, serving as tutors, mentors and role models in high-need schools. City Year responds to the challenges facing public education by providing Whole School, Whole Child (WSWC) services in high-need education institutions across the country. These services are rooted in using data to monitor student progress to better meet student needs, engaging in one-on-one and small group instruction in ELA and math with embedded social-emotional supports, establishing whole school activities that improve conditions for learning along with engaging families and inspiring civic engagement. City Year also provides extended-day activities: after-school programming, homework assistance, enrichment curricula and civic projects that build and serve communities.
 City Year AmeriCorps members are supervised by full-time, on site City Year staff called Impact Managers and these corps members and staff become integrated into the fabric of the school community. They collaborate with the school principal and teachers to deliver holistic, data-driven interventions at the individual student, classroom and school-wide levels that help the school achieve its vision for educational excellence.
 City Year also provides small group social-emotional skill building sessions, additional capacity in the classroom and classroom management support. City Year helps to close gaps in high-need schools by providing students with personalized support and additional developmental relationships while also providing schools with increased capacity to implement research-based reforms.
 City Year's model is based on research indicating that students who are at greatest risk of dropping out can be identified as early as in the sixth grade. City Year AmeriCorps members make positive connections with students, encourage them to come to school every day, and provide evidence-based academic supports for students who exhibit one or more early warning indicators: low attendance, poor behavior or course failure in English or math. Research shows that preventing one or more of these warning signs makes it three times more likely that a student will graduate, dramatically improving his or her lifetime trajectory.[4]
 In the 2017 – 2018 academic year, more than 3,000 City Year AmeriCorps members are serving approximately 223,000 students in 329 schools nationwide.
 City Year serves in 29 cities within the United States, with two international affiliates.[5]

 City Year AmeriCorps members represent a diverse array of racial, ethnic, religious and educational backgrounds. Approximately 80% of corps members are recent college graduates, 56% are people of color, 48% are Pell Grant eligible, 42% are fluent or conversational in a second language and 25% are first generation college students.
 AmeriCorps members begin their service year in the summertime, undergoing several weeks of intensive training before the beginning of the school year. During this training, corps members are oriented to City Year culture and trained on how to work within schools. They are assigned to serve on a team at a particular school, where they will work for the duration of their service year.
 Like other AmeriCorps members, City Year corps members receive a biweekly living allowance, or modest stipend. City Year AmeriCorps also receive health insurance benefits and qualify for a post-service Segal Education Award[9] through AmeriCorps. Additionally, City Year has local partnerships in all cities that offer benefits such as public transit passes and discounts to local businesses just for City Year AmeriCorps members.
 City Year has developed a comprehensive approach to leadership development designed to ensure AmeriCorps member success at City Year, and in whatever field City Year alumni choose to enter after their year of service. City Year was founded on the belief that a year of service transforms both the community being served and the individual providing that service. City Year recognizes that the development of new skills and knowledge is crucial, but there are also some deeper questions that need to be explored in the journey of leadership development.
 City Year AmeriCorps members wear a distinctive uniform, issued by the organization – a red jacket worn with black pants. City Year sites located in California wear yellow jackets due to pre-existing gang associations with the color red in the communities in which they serve.
 Prominent members of a community in which City Year serves and key supporters who have acted as major advocates or champions of the organization are often gifted with their own red jacket. This honor, over time, has led to the creation of City Year’s Red Jacket Society. The Red Jacket Society is a community of philanthropic individuals and families who believe in the power of the red jacket, which is founded in national service and a commitment to others.
 Red Jacket Society members believe that the red jacket is more than a uniform: it's a little bit of magic. It brings hope and inspiration, caring and support. The red jacket means help is on the way.
 City Year's funding comes from a variety of sources. In [null 2017, 23% of the organization's operating revenue came from] AmeriCorps, 54% from corporations, foundations and individual donors, and 23% from school districts and other local government grants. [1]
 City Year was started with private funding and still maintains many of its efforts via gifts from organizations as National Leadership Sponsors and Team Sponsors.
 City Year's National Partners work side by side with City Year lending their time, expertise and resources to support the mission of increasing the high school graduation rate. These investments can take many different forms and are allocated to programs and initiatives that align with the partners' and City Year's priorities. City Year National Leadership Sponsors include: Adobe Foundation, Aramark, AT&T, Bain Capital, Bank of America, Celanese Foundation, Cisco Foundation, Comcast NBCUniversal, CSX Transportation, Deloitte, New York Life Foundation, Microsoft,  PepsiCo Foundation and Red Nose Day.
 Public school districts partner with City Year to bring teams of AmeriCorps member to work in schools. Though it varies from district to district, schools are responsible for financing a portion of the cost of maintaining a team of City Year AmeriCorps members in service.
 Care Force is a part of City Year specifically created to engage corporations and their employees in high-impact volunteer events to help improve schools and communities.
 Care Force has helped to craft and lead volunteer experiences that have become an integral component of corporate partners' community service outreach, and inspired employees to want to serve again and again. Whether painting inspirational murals in a school hallway or transforming an unused space into a library; Care Force events physically transform the spaces where children and communities grow.
 Since launching in 2001, Care Force has led more than 90,000 volunteers in service projects and managed more than 600 events, and worked in over 130 communities in 10 countries over three continents.
 City Year is a five-time winner of the Social Capitalist award from the Fast Company Monitor group.[8] City Year has received positive reviews from the Princeton Review and the U.S. News & World Report, and has earned four stars from the organization, Charity Navigator.[9] City Year was also named to the Philanthropy 400, an annual ranking of America's nonprofits based on the contributions they raise from individuals, foundations, and corporations by the Chronicle of Philanthropy, in 2015 and 2016.
 City Year has been accused of exploiting its volunteers by demanding long hours of taxing work, while providing an inadequate stipend.[11] The organization has also been criticized by some for accepting a sponsorship from the soft drink manufacturer PepsiCo. Because City Year Corps members are role models to many children, this partnership might encourage greater consumption of soft drinks, which some see problematic in light of the current national woes with childhood obesity.[10]
 In 2001 at a conference on civil society in Cape Town, US President Bill Clinton brought a delegation of City Year Service Leaders and staff from Boston, to meet with former President Nelson Mandela. Mandela was eager to implement a programme in South Africa that afforded young people the opportunity to serve their communities. He loved the idea of City Year and after further conversations; City Year's first international site was launched in 2005 with 110 Service Leaders in Johannesburg.
 City Year brings together a diverse group of young people for a year of voluntary service and leadership development. These young people work in teams as tutors, mentors and role models to children in 10 primary schools throughout Johannesburg and Soweto. City Year South Africa works to support the growing National Youth Service movement, with a strong belief that youth service is a powerful vehicle for developing a generation of young leaders for South Africa, promoting a culture of service across all sectors of society, addressing critical development needs in schools and communities, and addressing youth unemployment.
 City Year South Africa provides a rigorous year of full-time community service, leadership development and skills training to young South African volunteers (Service Leaders).
 Since its inception in 2005 City Year South Africa has graduated over 1,200 Service Leaders who engaged over 20,000 children through after-school programs and various other projects. In total these Service Leaders have completed over 1 million hours of service.
 City Year launched in London during the 2010/11 academic year with 60 corps members working in teams across six primary schools. For the start of the 2011/12 school year City Year had 81 corps members serving across nine schools.[12]
 Since the 2010 general election, City Year London has met with range of Members of Parliament, government ministers, and Prime Minister David Cameron to champion service opportunities for young people across the UK.[13]
 In 2012 City Year London was awarded a Social Action Fund grant of £300,000 by the Government's Cabinet Office, which has gone towards the expansion of City Year's service across London and the development of three new school partnerships from September 2012.[14]
 As part of their year of service, City Year London corps members benefit from a year-long leadership development programme which is delivered by the organisation's corporate sponsors every Friday. Leadership development days help corps members to develop skills and competencies to be successful in securing a job after City Year. This includes CV and interview guidance, work-shadowing, networking sessions, public speaking and presentation skills training. Each corps member is also matched with a corporate mentor.[15] 95% of corps members who graduated from the 2011/12 City Year London programme successfully secured a place in education or employment after City Year.[16]
 An evaluation of City Year London's work in schools was conducted by the Institute for Volunteering Research in November 2012. It found that corps members were having a positive effect on the attainment, behaviour and focus of school children and that teachers valued the help and support they received from corps members in the classroom. The evaluation also highlighted a boost in confidence and the employability of City Year corps members who have completed the programme.[17]
 City Year London recruits a diverse corps to reflect the diversity of the children it works with. City Year is currently recruiting 18- to 25-year-old corps members from colleges, universities and youth centres across London and the rest of the UK. The organisation recruits a diversity of young people into the corps based on: socio-economic status, eligibility for Free School Meals, type of secondary education (e.g., public or private), educational attainment, gender and ethnicity. Approximately 60% of City Year London's current corps members are graduates while 40% are college leavers.
 The Private Equity Foundation helped to bring City Year from America to London in 2010. The Chief Executive of the Private Equity Foundation, Shaks Ghosh visited City Year in Boston in 2009 and was so impressed by its 'double benefit' model that she donated £1 million to help start up City Year in London. The Private Equity Foundation is City Year London's Lead Founding Partner.[10]"
Clinton Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Foundation	"The Clinton Foundation (founded in 1997 as the William J. Clinton Foundation[2] and from 2013 to 2015 briefly renamed the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation)[3] is a non-profit organization under section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. tax code. It was established by former President of the United States Bill Clinton with the stated mission to ""strengthen the capacity of people in the United States and throughout the world to meet the challenges of global interdependence.""[4] Its offices are located in New York City and Little Rock, Arkansas.
 Through 2016, the foundation had raised an estimated $2 billion from U.S. corporations, foreign governments and corporations, political donors, and various other groups and individuals.[5] The acceptance of funds from wealthy donors has been a source of controversy.[5][6] The foundation ""has won accolades from philanthropy experts and has drawn bipartisan support"".[5] Charitable grants are not a major focus of the Clinton Foundation, which instead uses most of its money to carry out its own humanitarian programs.[7]
 This foundation is a public organization to which anyone may donate and is distinct from the Clinton Family Foundation, a private organization for personal Clinton family philanthropy.[8][9]
 According to the Clinton Foundation's website, neither Bill Clinton nor his daughter, Chelsea Clinton (both are members of the governing board), draws any salary or receives any income from the Foundation. When Hillary Clinton was a board member, she reportedly also received no income from the Foundation.[10]
 The origins of the foundation go back to 1997, when then-president Bill Clinton was focused mostly on fundraising for the future Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock, Arkansas.[1] He founded the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2001 following the completion of his presidency.[11] Longtime Clinton advisor Bruce Lindsey became the CEO in 2004.[12][13] Later, Lindsey moved from being CEO to being chair, largely for health reasons.[12] Other Clinton hands who played an important early role included Doug Band[14] and Ira Magaziner. Additional Clinton associates who have had senior positions at the foundation include John Podesta and Laura Graham.[11]
 The foundation's success is spurred by Bill Clinton's worldwide fame and his ability to bring together corporate executives, celebrities, and government officials.[11] Similarly, the foundation areas of involvement have often corresponded to whatever Bill suddenly felt an interest in.[11]
 Preceding Barack Obama's 2009 nomination of Hillary Clinton as United States Secretary of State, Bill Clinton agreed to accept a number of conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the Clinton Presidential Center and the Clinton Global Initiative.[15] Accordingly, a list of donors was released in December 2008.[16]
 By 2011, Chelsea Clinton was taking a dominant role in the foundation and had a seat on its board.[11][17] To raise money for the Foundation, she gave paid speeches, such as her $65,000 2014 address at the University of Missouri in Kansas City for the opening of the Starr Women's Hall of Fame.[18]
 In 2013, Hillary Clinton joined the foundation following her tenure as Secretary of State. She planned to focus her work on issues regarding women and children,[19][20] as well as economic development.[12] Accordingly, at that point, it was renamed the ""Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation"".[11]  Extra attention was paid to the foundation due to the 2016 United States presidential election.[11][12]
 In July 2013, Eric Braverman was named CEO of the foundation.[13] He is a friend and former colleague of Chelsea Clinton from McKinsey & Company.[11][12]  At the same time, Chelsea Clinton was named vice chair of the foundation's board.[11][13]  The foundation was also in the midst of a move to two floors of the Time-Life Building in Midtown Manhattan.[11]
 Chelsea Clinton moved the organization to an outside review, conducted by the firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. Its conclusions were made public in mid-2013.[12] The main focus was to determine how the foundation could achieve firm financial footing that was not dependent upon the former president's fundraising abilities, how it could operate more like a permanent entity rather than a start-up organization, and thus how it could survive and prosper beyond Bill Clinton's lifetime.[11][12] Dennis Cheng, a former Hillary Clinton campaign official and State Department deputy chief, was named to oversee a $250 million endowment drive.[11] The review also found the management and structure of the foundation needed improvements, including an increase in the size of its board of directors that would have a more direct involvement in planning and budget activities.[12] Additionally, the review said that all employees needed to understand the foundation's conflict of interest policies and that expense reports needed a more formal review process.[12]
 In January 2015, Braverman announced his resignation. Politico attributed the move to being ""partly from a power struggle inside the foundation between and among the coterie of Clinton loyalists who have surrounded the former president for decades and who helped start and run the foundation.""[21] He was succeeded at first in an acting capacity by former deputy assistant secretary, Maura Pally.[22]
 On February 18, 2015, The Washington Post reported that, ""the foundation has won accolades from philanthropy experts and has drawn bipartisan support, with members of the George W. Bush administration often participating in its programs.""[5] In March 2015, former Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Clinton administration, Donna Shalala, was selected to run the Clinton Foundation.[23] She left in April 2017.[24]
 In August 2016 The Boston Globe's editorial board suggested that the Clinton Foundation cease accepting donations. The Globe's editorial board offered praise for the foundation's work but added that ""as long as either of the Clintons are in public office, or actively seeking it, they should not operate a charity, too"" because it represents a conflict of interest and a political distraction.[25]
 In 2016, Reuters reported that the Clinton Foundation suspected that it had been the target of a cyber security breach. As a consequence of the suspected cyber security breach, Clinton Foundation officials retained a security firm, FireEye, to evaluate its data systems. The cyber security breach has been described as sharing similarities with cyberattacks that targeted other institutions, such as the Democratic National Committee.[26]
 In October 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that four FBI field offices—in New York, Los Angeles, Washington and Little Rock—had been collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to determine whether ""there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling"". In a reported separate investigation, the Washington field office was investigating Terry McAuliffe before he became a board member of the Clinton Foundation.[27]
 CNN reported in January 2018 that the FBI is investigating allegations of corruption at the Clinton Foundation in Arkansas. Sources said that federal prosecutors are checking to see if foundation donors were improperly promised policy favors or special access to Hillary Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state in return for donations, and whether tax-exempt funds were misused by the foundation's leadership.[28]
 As of January 2018, the board members are:[29]
 As of January 1, 2010, the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative, an initiative of the Clinton Foundation, became a separate nonprofit organization called the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI).[11][30] Organizations such as the Clinton Foundation continue to supply anti-malarial drugs to Africa and other affected areas; according to director Inder Singh, in 2011 more than 12 million individuals will be supplied with subsidized anti-malarial drugs.[citation needed]
 In May 2007, CHAI and UNITAID announced agreements that help middle-income and low-income countries save money on second-line drugs. The partnership also reduced the price of a once-daily first-line treatment to less than $1 per day.[31]
 CHAI was spun off into a separate organization in 2010; Ira Magaziner became its CEO (he had been a key figure in the Clinton health care plan of 1993).[11] Chelsea Clinton joined its board in 2011, as did Tachi Yamada, former President of the Global Health Program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[11]
 The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) was founded in 2005 by Bill Clinton. Doug Band, counselor to Bill, was heavily involved in the formation.[14] Clinton has credited Band with being the originator of CGI and has noted that ""Doug had the idea to do this.""[32] Band left his paid position at CGI in 2010,[11] preferring to emphasize his Teneo business and family pursuits, but remains on the CGI advisory board.[12] The overlap between CGI and Teneo, of which Bill was a paid advisor, drew criticism.[11] Disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein is also said, according to his lawyers, to have taken part in the conception of CGI.[33]
 In 2007, Bill started CGI U, which expanded the model of CGI to students, universities, and national youth organizations. CGI U has been held at Tulane University, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Miami, the University of California, San Diego, The George Washington University, Washington University in St. Louis, Arizona State University, and University of California, Berkeley. Panelists and speakers have included Jon Stewart, Madeleine Albright, Vandana Shiva, Bill and Chelsea Clinton, Stephen Colbert, Jack Dorsey, Greg Stanton, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Shane Battier, Salman Khan (founder of Khan Academy), and U.S. Rep. John Lewis.[34][35][36][37][38]
 In September 2016, it was announced that the Initiative would be winding down to be discontinued and that 74 employees would be let go at the end of the year.[39][40] In January 2017, it was announced that another 22 employees would be let go by April 15, 2017, and that CGI University would be continued.[41][42]
 The Clinton Global Citizen Awards are a set of awards which have been given by the Clinton Global Initiative every year since 2007.[43] The awards are given to individuals who, in the opinion of the Clinton Foundation, are ""outstanding individuals who exemplify global citizenship through their vision and leadership"".[43] Past recipients of the award include Mexican businessman and philanthropist Carlos Slim,[43] Irish billionaire Denis O'Brien,[44] Moroccan entrepreneur Mohammad Abbad Andaloussi,[45] Rwandan President Paul Kagame,[46] Afghan women's rights activist Suraya Pakzad,[47] Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernández,[48] and Pakistani labor rights activist Syeda Ghulam Fatima.[49]
 In August 2006, Bill Clinton started a program to fight climate change, the Clinton Foundation's Climate Initiative (CCI)
.[50]  The CCI directly runs various programs to prevent deforestation and to rehabilitate forests and other landscapes worldwide, develop clean energy, and help island nations threatened by rising ocean levels.[51]
 On August 1, 2006, the Foundation entered into a partnership with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group, agreeing to provide resources to allow the participating cities to enter into an energy-saving product purchasing consortium and to provide technical and communications support.[52]
 In May 2007, CCI announced its first project which will help some large cities cut greenhouse gas emissions by facilitating retrofitting of existing buildings. Five large banks committed $1 billion each to help cities and building owners make energy-saving improvements aimed at lowering energy use and energy costs.[53]  At the 2007 Clinton Global Initiative, Bill Clinton announced the 1Sky campaign to accelerate bold federal policy on global warming.[54] The 1Sky campaign supports at least an 80% reduction in climate pollution levels by 2050.
 On May 19, 2009, CCI announced the global Climate Positive Development Program where it will work with the U.S. Green Building Council to promote ""climate positive"" city growth.[55]
 Norway and Germany are among the countries co-financing projects with the CCI in numerous developing and third-world countries.[56][57][58]
 The Clinton Development Initiative, originally the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative, was formed in 2006 as a partnership with Scottish philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter's Hunter Foundation to target the root causes of poverty in Africa and promote sustainable economic growth.[59]
 The Alliance for a Healthier Generation is a partnership between the Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association that was working to end the childhood obesity epidemic in the United States by 2010.
 The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which provided an initial $8 million to start the Healthy Schools Program, awarded a $20 million grant to expand the program to over 8,000 schools in states with the highest obesity rates.[60]
 At the industry level, the Alliance struck agreements with major food and beverage manufacturers to provide kids with nutritional options, and established nutrition guidelines for school vending machines, stores and cafeterias to promote healthy eating.  Some of the companies involved in these efforts are Coca-Cola, Cadbury plc, Campbell Soup Company, Groupe Danone, Kraft Foods, Mars and PepsiCo.[61][62]
 Established in 2007 with Canadian mining executive Frank Giustra — founder of the petroleum company Pacific Rubiales (renamed Pacific Exploration & Production in 2015) — CGSGI describes itself as ""pioneering an innovative approach to poverty alleviation.""[63] Giustra's involvement with the Clinton Foundation has been criticized by the International Business Times, The Washington Post, and the American Media Institute because it was accompanied by a sudden reversal in Hillary Clinton's position while Secretary of State concerning the United States–Colombia Free Trade Agreement, an agreement which she had previously opposed ""as bad for labor rights.""[64][65][66][67]
 In November 2012, Bill Clinton announced the launch of the Clinton Health Matters Initiative (CHMI). CHMI is a national initiative, building on the Clinton Foundation's work on global health and childhood obesity, that works to improve the health and well-being of people across the United States by activating individuals, communities, and organizations to make meaningful contributions to the health of others. CHMI holds an annual Health Matters conference every January in the Coachella Valley.[68]
 The Foundation has funded extensive disaster relief programs following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Shortly after Hurricane Katrina hit, President George W. Bush asked former Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton to raise funds to help rebuild the Gulf Coast region. The two Presidents, having worked together to assist victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami, established the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund to identify and meet the unmet needs in the region, foster economic opportunity, and to improve the quality of life of those affected.[69] In the first month after the hurricane, the Fund collected over 42,000 online donations alone; approximately $128.4 million has been received to date from all 50 states and $30.9 million from foreign countries.
 Both the foundation and the Clintons personally have been involved in Haiti before and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[11][70] Bill Clinton was named the head of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC) in 2010 after serving as UN special envoy to Haiti in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. The Clinton Foundation itself raised $30m and played an important part in the creation of the Caracol Industrial Park.  The IHRC mandate was removed by the Haitian legislature in 2011.[71]
 In 2013, Hillary Clinton established a partnership between the foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the United Nations Fourth World Conference On Women in Beijing in 1995.[72][73] This is called ""No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project.""[72][73] The project released a report in March 2015.[74]
 In March, 2015, the charity watchdog group Charity Navigator added the Clinton Foundation to a watch list (a designation meant to warn donors that questions have been raised about an entity's practices), after several news organizations raised questions over donations from corporations and foreign governments. It removed the foundation from its watch list in late December of that year.[75]  In September 2016, it gave it its highest possible rating, four out of four stars, after its customary review of the Foundation's financial records and tax statements.[76]  A different charity monitor, CharityWatch, said that 88% of the foundation's money goes toward its charitable mission and gave the foundation an A rating for 2016. In 2015, based on revenue of $223 million and an expense ratio of 12% the foundation spent in excess of $26 million to complete its mission.[77]
 The Clinton Foundation is a public organization to which anyone may donate.  Due to their similar names, the public foundation has sometimes been confused with the Clinton Family Foundation, which is reserved for the Clintons' private philanthropy.  The two foundations have sometimes been conflated by news sources.[8] The significantly smaller Clinton Family Foundation is a traditional private foundation that serves as the vehicle for their personal charitable giving.[9] Headquartered in Chappaqua, New York, it received nearly all of the approximately $14 million the Clintons gave to charity from 2007–13.[8]
 Around 2007, the Clinton Foundation was criticized for a lack of transparency. Although U.S. law did not require charities, including presidential foundations, to disclose the identities of their contributors, critics said that the names of donors should be disclosed because Hillary Clinton was running to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. Commentator Matthew Yglesias opined in a Los Angeles Times op-ed that the Clintons should make public the names of foundation donors to avoid any appearance
of impropriety.[78]
 A lengthy donors list was then released by the Foundation in December 2008,[16] which included several politically sensitive donors, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Blackwater Worldwide.[79] The Foundation stated that the disclosures would ensure that ""not even the appearance of a conflict of interest"" would exist once Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.[79]
 The foundation has been criticized for receiving donations from Middle-Eastern countries which are seen to oppress women (stoning for adultery, not being able to drive, requiring a male guardian, etc.). These countries include Saudi Arabia ($10–25 million), UAE, and Qatar.[80]  The foundation accepted these donations even though Hillary Clinton's 2016 Presidential campaign platform guaranteed to break down barriers that held women back.[81]
 In November 2016, Reuters reported that ""The Clinton Foundation has confirmed it accepted a $1 million gift from Qatar while Hillary Clinton was U.S. Secretary of State without informing the State Department, even though she had promised to let the agency review new or significantly increased support from foreign governments.""[82] Conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin opined that the Qatari gift ""raised ethical questions"" because of the nation's support for Hamas.[83]
 The ethics agreement between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation that had been put into force at the beginning of Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State in 2009 came under scrutiny from the news media during February 2015 as polls showed her the likely 2016 Democratic nominee for president.[84] The Wall Street Journal reported that the Clinton Foundation had resumed accepting donations from foreign governments once Secretary Clinton's tenure had ended.[85]  Contributions from foreign donors, which are prohibited by law from contributing to political candidates in the U.S., constitute a major portion of the foundation's income. A Washington Post investigation in 2014 showed that there was ""substantial overlap between the Clinton political machinery and the foundation"". The investigation revealed that almost half of the major donors who had backed Ready for Hillary, a group which supported her 2016 presidency bid, had given at least $10,000 to the foundation, either personally or through foundations or companies they run. The Clinton Foundation's chief communications officer Craig Minassian explained that it is a ""false choice to suggest that people who may be interested in supporting political causes wouldn’t also support philanthropic work.""[5]
 A subsequent Washington Post inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the Secretary's tenure found, in addition to six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before Clinton became Secretary as envisioned under the agreement, one instance of a new donation, $500,000 from Algeria for earthquake relief in Haiti, that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review, but did not.[86] Foundation officials said that if the former Secretary decided to run for president in 2016, they would again consider what steps to take in reference to foreign donations.[86] But in general, they stressed that, ""As with other global charities, we rely on the support of individuals, organizations, corporations and governments who have the shared goal of addressing critical global challenges in a meaningful way. When anyone contributes to the Clinton Foundation, it goes towards foundation programs that help save lives.""[86] State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki attested that the foundation's commitment to the ethics agreement in question ""has been over and above the letter of the law"".[87] In August 2016, after Clinton's securing the Democratic nomination, the Clinton Foundation announced that it will stop accepting foreign donations if she were elected.[88]
 In March 2015, Reuters reported that the Clinton Health Access Initiative had failed to publish all of its donors, and to let the State Department review all of its donations from foreign governments after it was spun off from the Clinton Foundation in 2010.[89] In April 2015, The New York Times reported that when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the State Department had approved transactions that allowed Russian state-owned corporation Rosatom to take a majority stake in Uranium One,[90] whose chairman had donated to the Clinton Foundation.[91] The State Department ""was one of nine government agencies, not to mention independent federal and state nuclear regulators, that had to sign off on the deal.""[92] FactCheck.org decided there is ""no evidence"" that the donations influenced Clinton's official actions or that she was involved in the State Department's decision to approve the deal,[93] and PolitiFact concluded that any ""suggestion of a quid pro quo is unsubstantiated"".[92]
 In February 2016, The Washington Post reported that the United States Department of State issued a subpoena to the foundation in the fall of 2015. According to the report, the subpoena focused on ""documents about the charity's projects that may have required approval from federal government during Hillary Clinton's term as secretary of state"" and ""also asked for records related to Huma Abedin, longtime Clinton aide who for six months in 2012 was employed simultaneously by the State Department, the foundation, Clinton's personal office, and a private consulting firm with ties to the Clintons.""[94]"
Comenius Foundation for Child Development	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comenius_Foundation_for_Child_Development	"The Comenius Foundation for  Child Development, or   Comenius Foundation for short (Polish: Fundacja Rozwoju Dzieci im. Komeńskiego, or Fundacja Komeńskiego), is a children's welfare non-governmental organisation based in Warsaw, Poland, established in September 2003.  The Foundation's goal is to provide equal educational opportunities to children aged 3–5 years, particularly in rural areas of high unemployment, in response to a dramatic decline in preschool education services in Poland.  Only 38% of children aged 3–5 attended pre-school, which means that some 750,000 children in this age group is left out of pre-school care.  In rural areas the attendance figure is below 10%. This is the lowest result in the whole European Union.
 The Foundation  organises and conducts training for teachers, school and kindergarten headmasters, teachers and local educational authorities.
 The Foundation's ""Where There Are No Pre-schools"" programme aims at helping rural communities  to develop new models for early-childhood education, based on local financial resources.  A pilot scheme was set up in 28  rural communities, where 75  Early Childhood Education Centres  have been set up, with over 800 children.  Educational activities are  provided by teachers  trained by the Comenius Foundation to use the project approach in the classroom. The local authorities cover the costs of the teachers' salaries and the premises, whereas the Foundation is responsible for financing the teacher training, monitoring the quality of teaching and setting up local libraries. An external evaluation of the programme, commissioned by the Foundation, will enable modification while the programme is being implemented."
Comic Relief	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Relief	"Elstree Studios
 Comic Relief is an operating British charity, founded in 1985 by the comedy scriptwriter Richard Curtis and comedian Lenny Henry in response to the famine in Ethiopia.[1] The concept of Comic Relief was to get British comedians to make the public laugh, while raising money to help people in need in Africa, and at home in the United Kingdom.[1] It is currently led by Liz Warner, founder of a production company. Key people include: Catherine Cottrell, Ruth Davison, Helen Wright, Charlotte Hillenbrand and Suzi Aplin.[2]
 The highlight of Comic Relief's appeal is Red Nose Day, a biennial telethon held in March, alternating with its sister project Sport Relief. The first live fundraising show, held on 4 April 1986, featured comedians and pop stars, including Rowan Atkinson, Billy Connolly, Stephen Fry, Kate Bush and co-founder Lenny Henry.[3]
 A prominent biennial event on British television, Comic Relief is one of the two high-profile telethon events held in the UK, the other being Children in Need, held annually in November. At the end of the 2015 Red Nose Day telethon on 14 March it was announced that in the 30-year history of Comic Relief the Red Nose Day and Sport Relief appeals had raised in excess of £1 billion.[4]
 
 Comic Relief was launched live on Noel Edmonds' Late, Late Breakfast Show on BBC1, on Christmas Day 1985 from a refugee camp in Sudan. The idea for Comic Relief came from the charity worker Jane Tewson, who established it as the operating name of Charity Projects, a registered charity in England[5] and Scotland.[6]
 On 4 April 1986[7] the inaugural live fund-raising show,[8] ""Comic Relief Utterly Utterly Live"", was staged at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London featuring popular alternative comedians and pop stars (including Rowan Atkinson, Billy Connolly, Stephen Fry, Lenny Henry, Kate Bush and Cliff Richard[9]).  An audio recording was released on WEA which included a live performance of the charity single ""Living Doll"" by Cliff Richard and the Young Ones.[7]
 The highlight of Comic Relief is Red Nose Day.[1] On 8 February 1988, Lenny Henry went to Ethiopia and celebrated the very first Red Nose Day Telethon. Over 150 celebrities and comedians participated. The event raised 15 million British pounds sterling and attracted 30 million television viewers on BBC1. To date, Richard Curtis and Lenny Henry are still active participants of the Red Nose Day Telethon which continues to raise funds for numerous charities that help children in need and tackle worldwide poverty.
 The charity states that its aim is to ""bring about positive and lasting change in the lives of poor and disadvantaged people, which we believe requires investing in work that addresses people's immediate needs as well as tackling the root causes of poverty and injustice"".[10]
 One of the fundamental principles behind working at Comic Relief is the ""Golden Pound Principle"" where every single donated pound (£) is spent on charitable projects. All operating costs, such as staff salaries, are covered by corporate sponsors, or interest earned on money waiting to be distributed.
 Currently, its main supporters are the BBC, BT, Sainsbury's supermarket chain and British Airways.  The BBC is responsible for the live television extravaganza on Red Nose Day; BT provides the telephony, and Sainsbury's sells merchandise on behalf of the charity.
 The July 2010 accounts for charity registration 326568 show grant payments of £59 million, net assets of £135 million, with an investment portfolio held in a range of managed pooled funds and fixed term deposits. The average full-time staff was 214, with 14 staff paid over £60,000 with remuneration for the year, excluding pensions, for Kevin Cahill, chief executive of £120,410.
 In 2002, Comic Relief and BBC Sport teamed up to create Sport Relief, a new initiative, aiming to unite the sporting community and culminate in a night of sport, entertainment and fund-raising on BBC One. Sport Relief is a biennial charity event, and the campaign deliberately alternates years with Red Nose Day, Comic Relief's flagship event.  Red Nose Day occurs in odd-numbered years, and Sport Relief in even-numbered years.
 In 2009, Comic Relief launched a website calling for a financial transaction tax, the ""Robin Hood"" tax.
 At the end of the 2015 Red Nose Day telethon on 14 March  it was announced that in the 30-year history of Comic Relief the Red Nose Day and Sport Relief appeals had raised in excess of £1bn (£1,047,083,706).[4]
 The television programming begins in the afternoon, with CBBC having various related reports, money raising events and celebrity gunging.  This is all in-between the regular programmes, but after the six o'clock news, the normal BBC One schedule is suspended at 7 pm in favour of a live show, with a break at 10 pm for the regular news programme.  Whilst the BBC News at Ten is aired on BBC One, Comic Relief continues on BBC Two, and then resumes on BBC One at 10:35 pm, with each hour overseen by a different celebrity team.  These celebrities do the work for free, as do the crew, with studio space and production facilities donated by the BBC.
 Regular themes throughout the shows include parodies of recent popular shows, films and clips, events, and specially filmed versions of comedy shows. Smith and Jones, and a parody sketch starring Rowan Atkinson are both regularly featured.[citation needed]
 Since 2015, Red Nose Day USA's annual Red Nose Day Special airs each May, typically on the Thursday before Memorial Day.
 The First Red Nose Day was held on Friday 5 February 1988 with the slogan: ""The Plain Red Nose"", and raised £15 million.[11]
 The Second Red Nose Day was held on Friday 10 March 1989 with the slogan: ""Red Nose Day 2"", and raised £27 million.[11] (This is also when the event would start generally being scheduled in mid-march, often close to, or on the 17th of March - St Patrick's Day.)
 The Third Red Nose Day was held on Friday 15 March 1991, with the slogan ""The Stonker"", and Raised £20 million. The charity song was a double A-sided single featuring ""The Stonk"" performed by Hale & Pace and ""The Smile Song"" performed by Victoria Wood.
 The Fourth Red Nose Day was held on Friday 12 March 1993 with the slogan ""The Invasion of the Comic Tomatoes"", and Raised £18 million.
 The Fifth Red Nose Day was held on Friday 17 March 1995, with the slogan ""What A Difference A Day Makes"", and Raised £22 million.
 The 1997 Red Nose Day event was held on 14 March. Its slogan for the year was ""Small Change – Big Difference"". The event raised over £27m for charitable causes.[12] The Spice Girls song ""Who Do You Think You Are"" became the official Comic Relief single of this event and sold 672,577 copies.[13] The telethon was hosted by Father Ted Crilly (Dermot Morgan) and Father Dougal McGuire (Ardal O'Hanlon), characters from the sitcom Father Ted.
 The 1999 Red Nose Day was held on 12 March and raised over £35m. Perennial hosts Jonathan Ross and Lenny Henry were joined by Davina McCall, Chris Evans, Ben Elton, Jack Dee and Julian Clary, with Peter Snow providing regular updates on donations. Angus Deayton hosted a live cross-over panel game, Have I Got Buzzcocks All Over. A parody of the Doctor Who series starring Rowan Atkinson as the Doctor, Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, was featured during the show, as was Wetty Hainthropp Investigates (a Victoria Wood parody of Hetty Wainthropp Investigates) and The Naughty Boys (a mock 1967 pilot for Men Behaving Badly).
 On Radio 1, Simon Mayo set the record of 37 hours of consecutive broadcasting (which was later broken in March 2011 by Chris Moyles on the same station for 52 hours, ""BBC Radio 1's Longest Show Ever with Chris Moyles and Comedy Dave for Comic Relief"", the world record for the longest show in radio history). The 1999 Comic Relief song was When the Going Gets Tough by Boyzone.
 The 2001 Red Nose Day was held on 16 March. The total raised was £61,000,140.[citation needed] As well as donations on the night of the TV show, money is raised from countrywide sponsored events and from merchandising, particularly of the red noses themselves. 5.8 million red noses were sold,[citation needed] approximately one tenth of the UK population. The final of Celebrity Big Brother 1 aired as well.
 The 2003 Red Nose Day was held on 14 March.  The fund raising activities included Lenny Henry providing the voice of the speaking clock between 10 and 23 March with the cost of the call going to Comic Relief.  On the night of the live show itself, £35m was raised, an on-the-night record.[citation needed]  A total of £61,477,539 was raised that year, setting a new record.[citation needed]
 Jack Dee stood outside at the top of a pole for the duration of the show, parodying the acts of David Blaine.  Celebrity Driving School led up to the event, with the test results announced during the telethon: they all failed.
 The hosts of Red Nose Day 2003 were:
 As usual a variety of specially filmed versions of television shows were made.  Popular BBC talent show Fame Academy returned as Comic Relief does Fame Academy.  Other shows included:
 Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan, a parody of Harry Potter, starring Dawn French as Harry Potter, Jennifer Saunders as Ron Weasley and Miranda Richardson as Hermione Granger.
 The 2005 Red Nose Day was held on 11 March, and was hosted by a collection of television stars:
 The 2005 event was also noteworthy for supporting the Make Poverty History campaign – many of the videos recorded for the MPH campaign (including videos by Bono and Nelson Mandela) were shown throughout the evening.  £65m was raised.[14]
 As usual a variety of specially filmed versions of television shows were made.  Popular BBC talent show Comic Relief does Fame Academy was attended by celebrities singing cover versions of songs.  Viewers voted for their favourite, with the proceeds going to the cause and the celebrity.  Other shows included:
 2005's telethon, more than any other, severely overran[citation needed] and many pre-filmed segments were cut short, including Harry Hill's TV Burp, Al Murray, Smith and Jones, and Lenny Henry as Condoleezza Rice.  The uncut versions have never been screened.
 McFly released the official single, a double A-side of ""All About You/You've Got a Friend"" which reached Number 1 in the UK singles chart, and also Number 1 in the Irish singles chart.  The cover is predominantly red and features the members of McFly dressed in red, wearing red noses, in honour of Red Nose Day.
 Raised by March 2006: £65 m.[citation needed]
 2007's Red Nose Day was held on 16 March.  Its tagline is ""The Big One"" which is also representative of the novelty nose.  Walkers, Kleenex and Andrex also promoted the charity, as well as Sainsbury's.
 The 2009 event took place on Friday 13 March 2009.  Fundraisers had three different nose designs to choose from: ""this one"", ""that one"" and ""the other one"" – all with different facial expressions.  The Saturdays provided the official single, a cover of 'Just Can't Get Enough'.
 The 2011 event took place on Friday 18 March 2011. £74.3 million was raised on the night, the highest ever 'on the night' total. This was beaten by £0.8 million on Red Nose Day 2013's on the night event.
 In addition to the continued absence of Rowan Atkinson, two more prominent supporters of the charity were absent for 2011 – this was the first ever Comic Relief event to feature no input from Dawn French, and the first for over ten years to feature no input from Matt Lucas. Similarly, several other frequent contributors from previous years appeared only in appeal films or as part of the 24 Hour Panel People event. Lenny Henry however finally returned after an absence to perform comedic material.
 The 2013 event took place on Friday 15 March 2013.  By the end of the night, Comic Relief raised £75,107,852.
 One Direction recorded the official single ""One Way or Another"", a medley of Blondie's ""One Way or Another"" and ""Teenage Kicks"" by The Undertones. The single was released on 17 February 2013.[15]
 The 2015 event took place on Friday 13 March 2015. It was broadcast live for the first time at the London Palladium, with £99,418,831 being raised, the highest so far.
 The 2017 event took place on Friday 24 March 2017, broadcast live from Building Six at The O2 in London. It was widely criticised, for both the quality of sound, sketches, and going from films on poverty to a biscuit competition.
 The 2019 event took place on Friday 15 March 2019 live from BBC Elstree Studios. The event raised £63,548,668.
 Various items of merchandise have been sold to promote and raise money for Comic Relief. In 1991, The Totally Stonking, Surprisingly Educational And Utterly Mindboggling Comic Relief Comic was published by Fleetway. Conceived, plotted and edited by Neil Gaiman, Richard Curtis, Grant Morrison and Peter K. Hogan, it featured contributions from a vast array of British comics talent, including Jamie Delano, Garth Ennis, Dave Gibbons, Mark Millar, Simon Bisley, Mark Buckingham, Steve Dillon, D'Israeli, Jamie Hewlett and Bryan Talbot. (Alan Moore, arguably Britain's most famous comics writer, was not credited as working on the book having sworn never to work for Fleetway again, but was said[17] to have worked with partner Melinda Gebbie on her pages.) The comic was unique in that it featured appearances by characters from across the spectrum of comics publishers, including Marvel and DC superheroes, Beano, Dandy, Eagle and Viz characters, Doctor Who, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, in addition to a cavalcade of British comedy figures (both real and fictional).  These were all linked by the twin framing narratives of the Comic Relief night itself, and the tale of ""Britain's meanest man"" Sir Edmund Blackadder being persuaded to donate money to the event. The comic ""sold out in minutes"", raising over £40,000[citation needed] for the charity, and is now a highly prized collectors' item. Comic Relief have also sold Fairtrade Cotton Socks from a number of vendors. This is mainly for their Sport Relief charity.
 In 1993 a computer platform game was released, called Sleepwalker. The game featured voice overs from Lenny Henry and Harry Enfield, and several other references to Comic Relief and tomatoes; the theme for the 1993 campaign.
 In 2001 J. K. Rowling wrote two books for Comic Relief based on her famous Harry Potter series, entitled Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages. The Fantastic Beasts book, would ultimately lead to the mid-late 2010s series of films of the same name as part of the expanded ""Potterverse"".
 In 2007, Walkers complemented the usual merchandise by adding their own take on the red nose, promoting red ears instead. The large ears, dubbed 'Walk-ears', are based on a very old joke involving the actual ears of ex-footballer Gary Lineker, who has fronted their ad campaign since the early 1990s. Walkers previously promoted the charity in 2005, making four limited edition unusual crisp flavours.
 The 2007 game for Red Nose Day, ""Let It Flow"", could be played online.  This game was developed by Matmi, worldwide viral marketeers, and set in the African wilderness. Mischievous hyenas had messed up the water irrigation system which fed the crops. You had to help re-arrange the pipes to let the water flow to the crops to keep them alive.  Once the pipes were arranged, you needed to operate the elephant's trunk to pump the water through the water pipes.
 For the 2007 campaign Andrex, known for their ad campaign fronted by a Labrador puppy, gave away toy puppies with red noses.
 As a Supporting Partner Jackpotjoy has launched two Red Nose Day Games for Red Nose Day 2011.
 The most prominent symbol of Comic Relief is a plastic/foam ""red nose"", which is given in various supermarkets and charity shops such as Oxfam in exchange for a donation to the charity and to make others laugh.  People are encouraged to wear the noses on Red Nose Day to help raise awareness of the charity.  The design of the nose has been changed each year, beginning with a fairly plain one, which later grew arms, turned into a tomato and even changed colour. This regular re-design was in part to stop people from re-using previous years designs, and having to buy the latest version, as for example  some people may re-use the same Poppy, repeatedly, rather than buying a new one each year.  In 2007, the red nose was made of foam; this was to facilitate the ""growing"" of the nose (by rolling it in the user's hands) to keep in line with that year's tagline, The Big One (see the table below).  Larger noses are also available and are designed to be attached to the fronts of cars, buildings and, in 2009, a 6-metre (20-foot) diameter inflatable nose was attached to the DFDS Seaways cruiseferry King of Scandinavia.  However, the nose's material used for buildings was classed as a fire hazard and was banned from the Comic Relief Does Fame Academy shows.
 As of 2019[update], Comic Relief has sold 50 different red noses over 17 Red Nose Days.[18][19] Two noses were available for the 1995 event. Three noses per event were available from 2009 to 2013. In 2015, nine noses were released, and in 2017, there were 10 different noses available—for both these years, this included a rare collector's nose. For 2019, 11 different noses are available to buy, including ""rare"" and ""ultra-rare"" noses. 
 All three came with six stickers depicting each of the noses, the RND 2009 logo and tag-line ""Do something funny for money"". Also included were a ""Hello, my nose is:"" name tag sticker and a small booklet of nose-related jokes. £59,187,065 was raised.
 An augmented reality version of the nose was created as part of the Red Nose Day website. Via a webcam the user's head was converted into a giant red nose which could then be recorded as a short movie and posted to Facebook or YouTube.
 Comic Relief hid 12 golden versions of these noses in stores around the country, offering winners a ""Golden Nose Experience"".
 The regular noses were:
 A selection of Red Nose Day ""car noses"" have been produced over the years, to show support for the charity while out on the road. They have traditionally been a curved nose which attaches to the car's radiator grille. In 2009, this was replaced with a magnetic design owing to safety concerns.[25] The original grill-attachable design returned for 2011, for the first time since 1999.[26]
 2014 saw the new release of 2 Flip Flap noses, the Poppy and England flag red nose designs and the first paper noses for cars and the 1st year for 2 car noses.
 In April 1986 the first Comic Relief charity record was released. It featured Cliff Richard and the cast of The Young Ones in a rendition of ""Living Doll"".
 Some of the money raised from the sale of each single is donated to Comic Relief. Normally a song is released just before the official Red Nose Day. There have been exceptions, such as ""(I want to be) Elected"" which was released to coincide with the 1992 UK general election. Before 1995's song, they were all more-or-less comedy records, mostly involving an actual band or singer, and a comedy group. From 1995 on, they have been generally more serious, although the videos still feature comical moments.
 2003 saw a return to the format of old. From 2005 to 2011, two comic relief songs were released each Red Nose Day, a song by a mainstream artist, and a comedy song.
 In 1991, a music video was created called Helping Hands which included numerous children's TV puppet personalities, including characters from 'The House of Gristle', 'Fraggle Rock', 'Rainbow', 'Roland Rat', 'Thunderbirds', 'Round the Bend', 'Bill & Ben', 'The Gophers', 'Spitting Image', 'Jim Hensons Tale of the Bunny Picnic' and more.  The song was never released.
 The best-selling Comic Relief single is Tony Christie and Peter Kay’s ""Is This the Way to Amarillo"", with 1.28 million copies sold. Westlife's 2001 cover of Billy Joel's ""Uptown Girl"" is the second biggest-seller, followed by 1986's ""Living Dolls"" and the Spice Girls' 1997 double-A side single ""Mama""/""Who Do You Think You Are"", with Boyzone's 1999 cover of ""When the Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going"" rounding up the top five.[27]
 In addition, the first Red Nose Day Schools' song ('Make Someone Happy') was published in 2007.  A CD of the song, together with backing tracks and fundraising ideas was sent free of charge to all primary schools in the UK in February by the education music publisher 'Out of the Ark Music'.  Schools will be free to use the song in assemblies, singathons, or other fundraising activities.  A second Red Nose Day Song has been released for every school in the UK to use free of charge.  It can be downloaded from the Red Nose Day 09 website, or watched on YouTube, and a copy is being sent to every primary school in the UK.  It has again been published by ""Out of the Ark"" music, and contains a more upbeat melody than the 2007 song.  It was recorded at Hook Studios, Hook, Surrey, by the Out of the Ark Choir, which is completely made up of children.  The children in the video wear Stella McCartney's special edition Comic Relief T-shirts, and has been filmed in black and white so only the red stands out.
 There has been some concern about the lack of gender equality in the causes supported by Comic Relief, with much funding going to politicised women's charities or charities focusing on females. Writing in The Spectator Ross Clark raised the question, ""why do all these women's charities ... feel the need to disguise their fundraising in the pratfest that is Comic Relief rather than appealing directly to the public?"" He added, ""are they worried that if the British public realised where their money was going they would be less inclined to be so generous?""[30]
 The British Stammering Association criticised comedian Lenny Henry for his opening sketch for the 2011 Comic Relief, during which he spoofed the film The King's Speech and grew impatient with Colin Firth's portrayal of King George VI as he stammered over his speech. The Sun reported that the British Stammering Association had branded the sketch as ""a gross and disgusting gleefulness at pointing out someone else's misfortune"".[31]
 In December 2013 a BBC Panorama programme pointed out that between 2007 and 2009 millions of pounds donated to Comic Relief had been invested in funds which appeared ""to contradict several of its core aims"", with shares in tobacco, alcohol and arms firms.[32]
 The 2017 event was negatively received by viewers with many criticising it for its various technical problems, poor sound, unfunny sketches and inappropriate jokes such as comedian Russell Brand yelling ""fucking hell"" after the broadcast cut off due to a technical fault, two sketches shown before the 9pm watershed; one in which comedian Vic Reeves shows a fake penis at Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid and another in which actor Brendan O'Carroll, playing his character Agnes Brown, shows the V sign and a scene in which presenter Graham Norton asks model Cara Delevingne why she had sex on a plane. However, the Carpool Karaoke and Red Nose Day Actually sketches and an appearance from singer Ed Sheeran were favourably received.[33] The video featuring Sheeran meeting and rescuing a child in Liberia for Comic Relief had been criticised as ""poverty porn"" and was given the ""Rusty Radiator"" award for the ""most offensive and stereotypical fundraising video of the year"".[34][35]
 In February 2019, David Lammy criticised Stacey Dooley for posting on social media about her trip to Uganda for Comic Relief, saying that ""the world does not need any more white saviours"", and that she was perpetuating 'tired and unhelpful stereotypes' about Africa.[36][37]  The remarks by Lammy were believed to have damaged the year's coverage of Red Nose Day; viewership dropped and the donations received for the broadcast in March 2019 fell by £8 million and the money raised that year was the lowest since 2007, a fall some have blamed on Lammy.[38][39]"
Community Network Projects	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Network_Projects	"Community Network is a registered charity in the United Kingdom,[1] formed initially in Northern Ireland in August 1990 as a six-month project to bring people together across the sectarian divide using telecommunications. It went on to become a UK-wide charity using telecommunications for social benefit.
 The charity's main focus is addressing loneliness for older people and its Chief Executive Angela Harris has spoken out about this increasing issue in society.[2] Community Network is also included as a resource to support loneliness in older people on the National_Health_Service website NHS Choices.[3]
 Community Network has been working since October 2013 with The Silver Line, a help line for older people established by Esther Rantzen CBE, by providing group calls called ""Silver Circles"".[4]
 A number of other long-term projects in farming, fishing and regional communities are also supported by the charity.
 Community Network operated its own teleconferencing service for 23 years until July 2013 when this operation was deemed non-core to the charity objectives and was transferred to The Phone Co-op.[5]
[6]
 The charity's day-to-day running costs continue to be partly funded by the income from this teleconferencing service which is also provided for other charities and not-for-profit organisations e.g. Mencap
 Community Network have provided a telephone conference service 'Seafarers Link' since 2009 through Community Network that supports retired seafarers.
 Through City Bridge Trust funding, the Community Network have supported phone groups for the elderly in London since 2012. [7]
 Bedford Borough Council funded a Community Network project starting in June 2012.
 The charity is a social enterprise focussed on establishing telephone communities as a way to socialise that is accessible to some of the people most affected by loneliness – older people, carers and disabled people with mobility problems.
 In 2009, Community Network was awarded the Social Enterprise Mark.
 Community Network operates Telephone Community groups; most 'meet' once a week for an hour, at an agreed time. Each group has a facilitator – a trained volunteer, who starts the discussion and supports group members to take part.
 Before each session, experienced operators call each of the group members, including the facilitator, to find out if they want to take part. They are then connected to the discussion. People taking part can put the phone down at any point.
 Some groups are for general socialising – people chat or choose a topic to discuss each week. Other groups offer health and other information. Some groups bring people together because they have something in common.
 The Community Network Chief Executive is Angela Cairns from Jan 2013.
 The Chair of Trustees is Stephen Heard from Dec 2012."
Compassion International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion_International	"Support Activities: US$105,453,519 (2013)[2]
 Compassion International is a Christian humanitarian aid child sponsorship organization dedicated to the long-term development of children living in poverty around the world. Compassion International, headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, functions in 25 countries such as Bolivia, Colombia, Mexico, Haiti, and Kenya. The organization provides aid to more than 2 million children. The chairman of the board is Karen Kemps Wesolowski, and Santiago Mellado is the President and CEO.[3]
 The Everett Swanson Evangelistic Association was founded in 1952 by Everett Swanson to help children orphaned by war in South Korea. He traveled there to preach the gospel to the troops of the army but during his visit he saw children orphaned by the war. In 1953, he began to raise funds and the next year he developed sponsorship programs to help support orphans for a few dollars a month.[4] The name of the association changed to Compassion, Inc. in 1963, inspired by Jesus' words ""I have compassion on the multitude. I will not send them away hungry"" (Matthew 15.32). Compassion, Inc. became Compassion International, Inc. in 1980. 
 Compassion International accepts contributions from a number of countries. Below are details on some of its coordinating organizations.
 Compassion Australia was officially registered in 1978 as Compassion Limited of Australia. It was established by Laurie and Olive McCowan.
 Compassion Canada was formed in 1963. This was the organization's Canadian branch. Based in London, Ontario, it was founded by Bob and Janet Forsyth of Blenheim, Ontario, who wanted to expand Compassion's ministry from the United States to Canada.[5]
 Service d'Entraide et de Liaison (SEL) of France became an affiliated partner country in 1990.
 Compassion Deutschland became a partner country in 2007.
 Compassion Italia became a partner country in 2001.
 Compassion Netherlands became a partner country in 1996.
 Tearfund New Zealand became a cooperating country partner beginning in 1986.
 Compassion Korea became a partner country in 2004.
 Compassion Suisse was formed in 2003. This was the organization's Swiss branch. Its original offices were located in Concise, were relocated to Yverdon-les-Bains in 2009.
 Child sponsorship is initially offered in Great Britain through an affiliation with TearFund beginning in 1975. Compassion UK opened in 1999.
 Compassion helps those in impoverished areas using a holistic approach to child development. This approach goes well beyond simply providing food and medical aid and also involves education and training to prepare the individuals for contributing back to their community.[6]
 Children in the Child Sponsorship Program are provided food and clean water, medical care, education, life-skills training, and spiritual guidance through a direct sponsorship. Sponsored children are selected by the sponsors and two-way communication is encouraged between the sponsored child and the sponsor. As of January 2019[update] the cost to sponsor a child through Compassion is US$38 per month. There are currently over 2 million children worldwide in this program.[7]
 Sponsors are able to visit their sponsored children through trips planned by Compassion International. Compassion's goal is to provide a trip to each country every other year. Compassion coordinates every aspect of the trip including travel, meals, tips and gratuities, fees related to the travel, and sightseeing fares.[8]
 Compassion operated in India for 48 years, with its $45 million in transfers a year, making it India's largest single foreign donor.[9] Compassion provided services under its Child Sponsor Program to 145,000 Indian children.[9] In 2015, Compassion affiliates' offices were raided by tax investigators seeking evidence whether it was funding religious conversions.[9] Compassion said it was then forced to direct funding to non-Christian Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh groups.[9] Compassion refused to do so as it would be a misuse of funds that donors all around the world trusted them with. After talks back and forth, in 2017, the Government of India barred Compassion from transferring funds into India, forcing the group to close its operations in that country.[9] The Ministry of External Affairs later clarified that the ban had nothing to do with the ideology of Compassion International.[10]
 Compassion provides child development aid to children and families in 25 countries.[citation needed] Each country's office is staffed by local personnel.

 Compassion International currently holds a rating of three stars (out of four) from Charity Navigator,[11] a grade of ""A"" from CharityWatch[12][13] and met the ""20 Standards for Charity Accountability"" from the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance.[14]
 Through 2015, Compassion International has received Charity Navigator's highest four star rating for 15 consecutive years, thereby receiving special recognition on their ""10 Charities with the Most Consecutive 4-Star Ratings"" list.[15]
 An empirical study published in the Journal of Political Economy showed that the sponsorship of children through Compassion International resulted in significantly higher rates of children completing school and greatly improved adult employment outcomes.[16][17] The study, led by University of San Francisco professor Bruce Wydick and involving over 10,000 individuals in six countries, showed that the Compassion child sponsorship program increased the probability of primary school completion by 4.0–7.7%, secondary school completion by 11.6–16.5%, and university completion by 2.1–2.4%. It also increased the probability of salaried employment in adulthood by 5.1–6.3% and the probability of white-collar employment by 6.5–6.7%.[16]"
Confetti Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confetti_Foundation	"Launched in February 2014 by Stephanie Frazier Grimm, the Confetti Foundation organizes birthday parties for sick children who are in the hospital on their special day.
 Headquartered in Newport, RI, the Confetti Foundation was founded by Stephanie Frazier Grimm to try to enable families to “shift their focus from their child’s illness for a mere half an hour, during which time they would celebrate the child.”  For just half an hour over an oft-extended period of time dealing with doctors, medical tests and other invasive procedures, the child would be able to do something “normal” like other kids do, and celebrate their special day.[1]
 One of the inspirations behind creating the foundation was Stephanie's own experience.  She was hospitalized during her 13th birthday and remembers how bad it was.  There was no one to do anything for her birthday.[2]
 In 2010, Stephanie was reminded of this when her best friend Brandy gave birth eight weeks early to a baby boy who had a whole slew of complications.  Brandy was driving hours every day to the NICU hospital with her toddler and husband to visit Christian and during those drives, Stephanie chatted to her about all sorts of regular daily things just to distract her from what was happening with Christian. During one of those conversations Brandy mentioned how one of Christian's hospital “buddies” was leaving the hospital and they were having a celebration.  Stephanie then asked about what the children got at the hospital for their birthdays and was shocked to hear nothing.  The only time a party happened was when a child left.  Stephanie knew at that point she wanted to change that.[3]
 The Confetti Foundation aims to ensure all hospitalized kids will be able to celebrate their birthdays.  To facilitate this, it supplies party starter kits. In 2014 the goal was to raise funds so that 500 boxes could be supplied and that the foundation has a presence in every single state of America.
 The Foundation organizes celebratory parties in hospitals and sends birthday fairies to implement them.  The birthday fairies are volunteers who have contacted their local children's hospital to work with The Confetti Foundation and hand deliver every single party supply box to the hospital.
 The birthday box has everything needed for a birthday party. There are 50 different themes the celebrant's family can select. Each box contains: a banner, between four and eight settings of disposable plates, napkins, utensils, decorations, a handmade card and T-shirt for the celebrant.[4]   An extra “gift” can be added to the themed box such as a princess book (princess theme) or a gym bag (sports theme).
 Each birthday party box costs around $22, and as of June 2014, enough money was raised to package and distribute 335 boxes to 64 hospitals! The Confetti Foundation seeks to bolster its fundraising by partnering with businesses which will benefit from a PR push via the foundation's social media activities.
 The Confetti Foundation appeared in Sugarlands Distilling Co.’s ‘The Top 50 Feature’ in January 2016.[5]"
Conrad N. Hilton Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_N._Hilton_Foundation	"The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation  is an American non-profit charitable foundation, established in 1944 by hotel entrepreneur Conrad N. Hilton. It remained relatively small until his death on January 3, 1979 when it was named the principal beneficiary of his estate. In 2007, Conrad's son, Barron Hilton announced that he would leave about 97% of his fortune (estimated at $2.3 billion),[1] to a charitable remainder unitrust which will eventually be merged with the Foundation,[2] of which he is currently a member of the board of directors.[1]
 The Foundation's mission is derived from the last will and testament of Conrad N. Hilton that directs the organization to ""relieve the suffering, the distressed, and the destitute.""[3] The Foundation now focuses on six strategic areas: ending chronic homelessness, preventing teen substance abuse, helping youth make the transition out of foster care, providing access to safe water, support for the work of Catholic Sisters, and working with young children affected by HIV and AIDS. The Foundation also funds five smaller program areas: confronting sight loss; overcoming multiple sclerosis; responding to disasters; nurturing Catholic schools; and educating students for hospitality industry.[4] Typically, the foundation awards large, long-term grants to nonprofit organizations.[5] “Increasingly, we are being more strategic in our areas of interest,” said Ed Cain, Vice President of Grant Programs. “We’re trying to make the biggest difference possible with the resources at our disposal, and making sure that these projects deliver tangible results.”[6]
 The Foundation's current assets are approximately $2.5 billion.  Since inception, the Foundation has awarded more than $1.5 billion in grants.  Currently more than 50% supports international charitable projects.[7]
 Conrad Hilton's grandson Steven M. Hilton is currently the chairman of the organization. He started working at the foundation in 1983 and served as its CEO from 2005 to 2015.[8] Hilton retired as president and CEO, and was succeeded by Peter Laugharn.[9][10] In his retirement announcement, Hilton said, “When I joined the Hilton Foundation in 1983, I couldn’t imagine the path that lay ahead. At that time, a handful of staff guided about $6 million in grants annually. Fast forward to today, and we have grown to a staff of over 50 and have awarded over a billion dollars in grants to improve the lives of disadvantaged and vulnerable people around the world.”[11] Peter Laugharn began his tenure as president and CEO on January 1, 2016.[12]
 The Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize is awarded annually by the Foundation. It was inaugurated in 1996 and is the largest humanitarian award in the world. Its annual award of USD 1.5 million was increased in 2015 to 2 million to commemorate its 20th Hilton Humanitarian Prize laureate, Landesa. It is currently larger than any one of the six Nobel Prizes.[13]
 The award is presented to a nonprofit organization judged to have made exemplary and extraordinary contributions in alleviating human suffering. Following initial background and legal review, the Hilton Humanitarian Prize staff conducts an extensive evaluation of the candidates, which is then submitted to an independent, international jury that makes the final selection.
 According to the Foundation, ""The Prize is not only intended to recognize and advance the efforts of the recipient organization, but also to call attention to the worldwide need for humanitarian aid and encourage others to expand their support."" The creation of the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize by the Foundation was inspired by the will of Conrad Hilton.
 ""There is a natural law, a Divine law, that obliges you and me to relieve the suffering, the distressed and the destitute. Charity is a supreme virtue, and the great channel through which the mercy of God is passed on to mankind. It is the virtue that unites men and inspires their noblest efforts.[3]"
Counterpart International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_International	"Counterpart International (Counterpart) is a non-profit organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. The organization’s mission is: Counterpart partners with local organizations – formal and informal – to build inclusive, sustainable communities in which their people thrive.
 Since its founding more than 50 years ago, Counterpart has established programs and activities in more than 60 countries on six continents.
 The organization was established in 1965 as the Foundation of the People of the South Pacific (FSP) by an Australian Marist missionary priest, Father Stanley Hosie, and actress Elizabeth ""Betty"" Bryant Silverstein. Ms. Silverstein and Father Hosie focused on supporting communities in the remote and often-overlooked islands of the South Pacific.
In 1968, the organization began receiving funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). During the 1970s, FSP obtained more grants to expand its staff and to transition its field offices into indigenous, independent NGOs that were locally staffed. FSP improved on the model of international aid by providing institutions in the South Pacific with skills to rebuild infrastructure, develop sustainable solutions to poverty, and facilitate economic growth. 
In 1992, (USAID) tapped the organization to “go global” and help determine a role for U.S. non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the former Soviet Union. At this time, the  organization's name was changed to Counterpart International to better reflect an expanded mission.
 
 Counterpart International currently has programs in civil society and governance; social inclusion; communities in conflict; food security and nutrition; and climate resiliency.
 Our current efforts in more than 30 countries around the world empower individuals, organizations and networks to take an active role in shaping the development of their communities and countries. We recognize the power of local ownership, and support efforts to enhance transparency and accountability which contribute to the strengthening of partnerships and cooperation between different sectors of society.
 Since its founding in 1965, Counterpart has focused on gender equity and social inclusion as guiding principles. We believe the voice of every community member matters, and everyone has the right to participate in their community’s well-being. In all our programs, we bring marginalized people into civic life, supporting their ability to influence decisions that affect their lives.
 Communities around the world are under enormous stress from political unrest, gang violence, competition over resources, extremist influence and the aftermath of war and ethnic conflict. With partners and leaders at the community and national level Counterpart works to promote tolerance, mitigate conflict, accelerate reconciliation and improve community resiliency.
 To realize the full potential of any society, populations need to be healthy, starting with children. Counterpart works with local partners around the world to improve the production of and access to nutritious food for children. We support community-led and school-based efforts to reduce malnutrition, implement sustainable agricultural practices and improve food security.
 The challenges facing people in many countries where we work are made worse by the impacts of climate change. Counterpart works with coastal and farming communities to improve climate resiliency while improving livelihoods.
 Counterpart has a staff of 500 people in more than 25 countries with headquarters in Arlington VA. The organization is overseen by a board of directors who are responsible for the legal and fiduciary operations of the organization. The current board of directors consists of:
 In 1991, President George Bush awarded FSP co-founder Betty Silverstein with the U.S. Presidential End Hunger Award for Individual Achievement. First Lady Hillary Clinton also commended Silverstein at Counterpart's 500th humanitarian Airlift at Andrews Air Force Base in Virginia in early 1998.[1]
 Counterpart has delivered over half a billion dollars' worth of aid to countries in former USSR, Central Asia Republics, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.[citation needed]
 Counterpart's Armenia Office was involved in the announcement of the Civil Society Fund 2009 winners. The office is also part of Counterpart International's Limited Intervention Program Statement (LIPS) grants.[2]
 In May 2009, Counterpart was granted a Leader with Associates (LWA) Cooperative Agreement with USAID, who expressed confidence in Counterpart to implement the ""Global Civil Society Strengthening"" (GCSS) program that builds the capacity of civil society organizations around the world. Counterpart held the LWA for eight years, and received $350 million in awards through the agreement."
The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crohn%27s_and_Colitis_Foundation_of_Canada	"Crohn's and Colitis Canada is a Canadian national volunteer-based charity dedicated to finding cures for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and to improving the lives of children and adults affected by these chronic conditions.
 Crohn's and Colitis Canada, formerly known as Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada, was started in 1974 by a group of concerned parents who saw the need to raise funds for Crohn's and colitis research and to educate patients and their families about these diseases. In a short time span, this small group of dedicated parents has grown to a large, national organization, with thousands of volunteers and chapters from coast-to-coast.
 Medical research is the best hope for finding a cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To date, Crohn's and Colitis Canada has invested more than $101 million in major research projects and is Canada's largest non-governmental funder of Crohn's and colitis research (and the second largest in the world).
 Patient programs, advocacy and awareness are also part of Crohn's and Colitis Canada's mandate. They provide information on these diseases to patients, their families, health professionals and the general public through education brochures, in-person and online events, chapter meetings, programs, and their website, www.crohnsandcolitis.ca.
 Crohn's and Colitis Canada hosts many fundraising events throughout the year, including the Gutsy Walk held in June in over 60 communities across Canada, as well as other national and local events. Volunteers are involved in all events, and there are many events taking place throughout the year in communities large and small.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_Fibrosis_Foundation	"The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in the United States established to provide the means to cure and control cystic fibrosis (CF). The Foundation provides information about cystic fibrosis and finances CF research that aims to improve the quality of life for people with the disease. The Foundation also engages in legislative lobbying for cystic fibrosis.[7]
 The Foundation was established in 1955 by a group of volunteers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
 In addition to providing grants for research into cystic fibrosis and supporting clinical trials, the foundation promotes and accredits 115 specialized centers for treatment of individuals with cystic fibrosis. The Foundation has over 80 chapters and offices across the United States.
 Before it began using the current name, the organization was known as the ""National Cystic Fibrosis Research Foundation"".[6]
 In 1989, scientists working for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation discovered the gene that causes cystic fibrosis, considered the key to developing a cure for cystic fibrosis.
 From 1982 until 1999, sports journalist Frank Deford served as chairman of the Foundation.
 The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has been a pioneer of cystic fibrosis treatment, having played a major role in the development and use of five FDA-approved therapies, including ivacaftor (Kalydeco).[7]
 In 2014, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the Foundation’s 2013 budget.[8][9]
 Currently the Foundation operates out of Bethesda, Maryland.  Preston Campbell, M.D. is the active president and CEO of the organization.[10]
 The Foundation hosts several philanthropic events both locally around the chapters and nationwide. One of the biggest signature events is the Great Strides walk, established in 1989.It is a sponsored walk akin to Race for the Cure, where participants walk 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) to raise money to support research for cystic fibrosis. There are Great Strides walks in over 560 locations throughout the country.Great Strides has succeeded in raising over $180,000,000 for cystic fibrosis research. 
 Some other signature events include the CF Cycle for Life, CF Climb, Xtreme Hike, and Team CF. The list of national events includes Ultimate Golf Experience, American Airlines Celebrity Ski, and Volunteer Leadership Conference. Individual chapters may host their own events which may include, but are not limited to, fishing events, dinner dance events, golf tournaments, and finest events.[11]"
David and Lucile Packard Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_and_Lucile_Packard_Foundation	"The David and Lucile Packard Foundation is a private foundation that provides grants to not-for-profit organizations.  It was created in 1964 by David Packard (co-founder of HP) and his wife Lucile Salter Packard.  Following David Packard's death in 1996, the Foundation became the beneficiary of part of his estate.  The foundation's goals, through the use of grants, are to ""improve the lives of children, enable creative pursuit of science, advance reproductive health, and conserve and restore earth’s natural systems.[3]""  As of 2016, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation was the 20th wealthiest foundation in the United States.[2]
 As of December 2015, the Foundation's investment portfolio totaled $6.7 billion. General program grant awards for 2015 totaled $307 million.
 The majority of grants are distributed among four main program areas: Conservation and Science; Population and Reproductive Health; Children, Families, and Communities; and Local Grantmaking.[3] The Foundation also deploys Mission Investments to expand the impact of grantmaking by making loans and equity investments to further programmatic goals.
 The Conservation and Science program invests in actions and ideas that conserve and restore ecosystems while enhancing human well-being.
 It promotes effective management of fisheries and an end to both overfishing and destructive fishing methods.  It promotes sustainability in coastal systems in three specific locations: California's coast, the Gulf of California, and the Western Pacific.  It funds marine research and management for coastal-marine systems.  It supports energy policy reforms and research in the United States, China, and the Amazon. The program also provides academic grants for university researchers.
 The foundation also funds the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, an oceanography research center, and the Center for Ocean Solutions, which brings together marine science and policy to develop solutions to the challenges facing the ocean.
 In 1988, the Foundation established the Packard Fellowships for Science and Engineering to provide the nation’s most promising early-career scientists and engineers with flexible funding and the freedom to take risks and explore new frontiers in their fields of study. Each year, the Foundation invites the presidents of 50 universities to nominate two early-career professors each from their institutions. An advisory panel of distinguished scientists and engineers carefully reviews the nominations and selects 16 Fellows to receive individual grants of $875,000, distributed over five years. Packard Fellows have gone on to receive additional awards and honors, including the Nobel Prize; the Fields Medal; and MacArthur, Sloan, Searle, and Guggenheim fellowships.
 The Population and Reproductive Health program is committed to promoting reproductive health and rights, with a focus on high quality information and services. The Foundation supports programs that promote the rights of individuals to make educated decisions about family planning. The program is focused specifically (but not exclusively) on Ethiopia, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, and the southern United States.
 The Children, Families, and Communities program area is focused on providing early education through the Preschool for California's Children program. The program area also supports Health Insurance for all children and after-school programs for elementary and middle school students in California.
 The Local Grantmaking Program builds on the longstanding commitment made by David and Lucile Packard to invest in the region where they started their company and raised their family. Dedicated to achieving deep and meaningful impact in local communities, the Local Grantmaking Program makes investments in the five contiguous counties of San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San Benito and Monterey —as well as Pueblo, Colorado, the birthplace of David Packard.
 The annual Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering is the largest award given to young faculty in STEM fields, and is widely regarded as one of the most prestigious awards given to junior faculty members.[4]  Fellows receive an award of $875,000, distributed over five years, which has ""no strings attached"" and are designed to provide maximum flexibility in pursuing new scientific questions.  Roughly 18 fellows are selected each year; a total of 577 awards have been made since 1988.  Packard Fellows' work has contributed to breakthroughs like the creation of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique, the discovery of soft tissues in dinosaur fossils, and the first-ever observation of a neutron star collision. Fellows have gone on to receive a range of accolades, including Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics, the Fields Medal, the Alan T. Waterman Award, MacArthur Fellowships, and elections to the National Academies."
David Suzuki Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Suzuki_Foundation	"The David Suzuki Foundation is a science-based environmental organization headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with offices in Montreal and Toronto. It is a non-profit organization that is incorporated in both Canada and the United States, and is funded by close to 30,000 donors. The Foundation describes its goal as to:
 The mission of the foundation is to ""protect nature’s diversity and the well-being of all life, now and for the future"" and their vision is that ""we all act every day on the understanding that we are one with nature.""[1]
 Its origins lie in a 1989 ""think-tank"" retreat on Pender Island, British Columbia that was organized by David Suzuki and Tara Cullis. A dozen concerned individuals were invited, and inspired by those discussions the Foundation was incorporated on September 14, 1990. It officially opened its doors on January 1, 1991. It is a federally registered Canadian charity supported entirely by Foundation grants and donations.  It does not accept any government funding, except from the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.[2] It is also not a funding body for other organizations.  Currently the Foundation employs roughly seventy-five staff members.[3]
 The Foundation has four main program departments – Ontario and Northern Region, Quebec/Francophone, B.C. and Western Region, and Science and Policy. Together, they focus on the following areas:
 Protecting our climate — ensure that Canada is doing its fair share to avoid dangerous climate change and is on track to achieve a safe level of greenhouse gas emissions.
 Transforming the economy — make certain that Canadians can maintain a high quality of life within the finite limits of nature through efficient resource use.
 Protecting nature — work to protect the diversity and health of Canada's marine, freshwater, and terrestrial creatures and ecosystems.
 Reconnecting with nature — ensure that Canadians, especially youth, learn about their dependence on a healthy environment through outdoor education.
 Building community — engage Canadians to live healthier, more fulfilled and just lives with tips on building Earth-friendly infrastructure, making smart energy choices, using efficient transportation, and being mindful of the products, food and water we use.
 As part of its work the Foundation publishes newsletters, scientific studies, research reports, books, information kits, brochures, and news releases. Some major project areas include:
 Trottier Energy Futures Project – includes scientific reviews of the full range of energy production and distribution opportunities available to Canada, taking into account economic, social and environmental concerns.
 Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Seafood – includes work with SeaChoice.org to rank seafood options based on Green (best choice), Yellow (some concerns) and Red (avoid).
 The Saint Lawrence: Our Living River – focuses on protecting the health of one of Canada's most important waterways.
 Natural Capital Evaluation – evaluates and describes ecosystem services, and calculates the economic cost if we had to provide them ourselves.
 Habitat Protection and Endangered Species – includes scientific work to protect species and habitat, including grizzly bears and caribou.
 Connecting Youth with Nature – uses educational guides and outreach to encourage kids – and adults – to spend more time outdoors.
 Queen of Green – offers useful tips and methods to reduce your personal environmental impact.
 As a mechanism to promote public awareness and action with regard to the Foundation's four focuses, the Foundation created the Nature Challenge program. In consultation with the Union of Concerned Scientists the Foundation researched the most effective ways to help conserve nature and improve our quality of life, and invited the public to embrace them in their daily lives.  Their list is:
 As of November 2007, over 500 000 individuals had taken David Suzuki's Nature Challenge.[4] Many famous Canadians have taken David Suzuki's Nature Challenge, including Nelly Furtado, Sam Roberts, Margaret Atwood, Robert Munsch, Larry Campbell, and David Miller.
 ""Canada vs the OECD: An Environmental Comparison"", a 2001 report published by University of Victoria Eco-Research Chair of Environmental Law and Policy Staff and authored by David R. Boyd, environmental lawyer and coauthor of the forthcoming book David Suzuki's Guide to Helping the Planet,[5] examined 25 environmental indicators, ranks Canada 28th out of the 29 OECD nations. The foundation and Boyd created a separate report, ""Sustainability within a Generation"", that addresses Canada's capacities to improve sustainability and environmental conservation. The foundation believes this can be best accomplished by improving efficiency, eliminating waste and pollution, and building sustainable cities.
 In February 2004, Suzuki met with the Prime Minister of Canada, Paul Martin, to present the Foundation's report on how sustainability could be achieved within a generation.
 Despite a strong scientific consensus on the health and safety of genetically modified foods, or GMOs, the foundation’s website includes an ""Understanding GMO"" page which claims ""the safety of GMO foods is unproven and a growing body of research connects these foods with health concerns ...""[6]
 During an interview on the John Oakley Show in Toronto, Suzuki stated that ordinary people fund his foundation and corporations are not as interested in funding it.[7]
 President of the conservative Canadian Centre for Policy Studies Joseph C. Ben-Ami, citing this statement in his article ""Global Warming Charlatan"" notes that the foundation's 2005-2006 annual report [8] lists 52 corporations, including Bell Canada, Toyota, IBM, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Scotia Capital, Warner Bros., Canon and the Bank of Montreal, amongst its 40,000 donors. Many years ago, before the Foundation implemented its Ethical Gift Acceptance Policy, corporate donors included EnCana Corporation, a world leader in natural gas production and oil sands development, and ATCO Gas, Alberta's principal distributor of natural gas, and OPG which is one of the largest suppliers of electricity in the world operating five fossil fuel-burning generation plants and three nuclear plants.[9]
 The David Suzuki Foundation's financial and donor information is available on the Foundation website. For 2011/12, most funding (59%) came from individual donors. Foundations and businesses provided another 25% and 13% respectively. More than 95% was from Canadian donors. The David Suzuki Foundation also has an Ethical Gift Acceptance policy.
 Three-quarters of the Foundation's 40,000 supporters have donated less than $500.[8]
 Between 2000 and 2010, the David Suzuki Foundation has received $44 Million from tax receipted donations [10]
 Columnist Licia Corbella, formerly of The Calgary Sun is a long-standing critic of the David Suzuki Foundation and is known for denying the existence of human-caused climate change. Writing about Suzuki meeting with Calgary elementary school students, states that the speech ""was essentially urging those listening not to vote Conservative. That makes his message partisan and should exempt the David Suzuki Foundation from receiving tax deductible status.""[11]
 However, Suzuki makes a distinction between what he says as an individual and what the Foundation says. For example, he has called Ottawa's plan to fight global warming a ""national embarrassment"" and has said of the government's energy policy: ""It's not a strategy, it's a shame."" He makes it clear that this is his personal opinion and has ""nothing to do with [his] foundation.""[12] And, as Lloyd Alter notes in an article in Treehugger, in Canadian law, charities are permitted to comment on politics:
 Charities have wide latitude to comment on politics, provided they don't endorse parties or candidates and can devote up to 10 per cent of their resources for non-partisan political activities... this spending can be undertaken 'to influence law, policy, and public opinion on matters related to its charitable purposes.' Among the permitted activities, groups can meet with elected officials, hold conferences, workshops, lectures and rallies, and mount letter-writing campaigns about issues.[12] Suzuki stepped down from the Board of Directors of the Foundation in April 2012.[13]"

Since 2017, it has also operated a system of colleges, many of which have run into financial and regulatory trouble.  [1]
 The president of Dream Center is Matthew Barnett.
 The organization was founded in 1994 with Matthew Barnett and Tommy Barnett, as a home missions project of the Southern California District of the Assemblies of God.[2] In 2001, Pastor Matthew Barnett and the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel merged the Dream Center with the Angelus Temple, with Pastor Barnett becoming the senior pastor over Angelus Temple as well as the Dream Center.
 It is located at 2301 Bellevue Avenue in the Echo Parkneighborhood of Los Angeles, California, two miles from Downtown Los Angelesand a little over two miles from Hollywood. Based out of the former Queen of Angels Hospital at Bellevue and Waterloo Street, the facility consists of almost 400,000 ft² (37,000 m²) in buildings on 8.8 acres (36,000 m²) of prime commercial real estate.I
 Associated Dream Centers have been established in other cities. Over 100 Dream Centers have been launched around the world.[3]
 The Dream Center has a number of resources for both the community and people living in different states or countries. For the homeless they have a transitional family housing program, Skid Row outreach and a food chapel. They have a human trafficking program, with an emergency shelter and emergency hotline. For community outreach there is The Dream Center Academy, The Lord's Gym, Adopt-a-Block, a youth center, and the Worship Project. A food truck and food bank serve the hungry. Emancipating Youth Home program, foster care intervention, clothing outreach, a mobile medical clinic, an adult education program, and job placement and transition programs are available for youth. For people in recovery there are the men's and women's Discipleship live-in programs.
 In 2017, a subsidiary of the Dream Center, in partnership with a private equity fund, purchased the Art Institutes, South University, and Argosy University systems of for-profit colleges from Education Management Corporation.[4] The transaction received significant scrutiny, due to concerns about Dream Center's ability to successfully manage the acquired schools, and criticism that the transaction was designed to allow the schools to avoid increased regulation of for-profit colleges.[4]   The transaction , which was not approved by the Department of Education under the  Obama Administration, was approved in 2017 by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. In 2019, a number of the art institutes and other colleges were closed, with some closures announced abruptly in the middle of the academic year.[5]  Some of the Art Institute programs were transferred to Studio Enterprise, a Los Angeles creative arts  training firm funded by principals of the  private equity firm Colbeck Capital Management. [1]
 
 According to BBC News, some Hurricane Katrina evacuees who stayed at the Dream Center felt like prisoners.[6] In response to the complaints several social activists, led by Ted Hayes, an advocate for the homeless, called a news conference demanding an investigation of the Dream Center. After visiting the Dream Center, however, and being given a tour of the facility, the activists concluded that the accusations were groundless. In fact, they were found to be from a smear campaign. ""There is no basis to the complaints we've heard,"" Hayes said, ""The horror stories reported to us do not exist.""[7]

Drosos Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosos_Foundation	"The Drosos Foundation (German: Drosos Stiftung) is a non-profit, charitable organization based in Zurich, Switzerland. Established in late 2003 with capital from a private endowment, the foundation was fully active by early 2005.[1][2] The foundation is involved with more than 100 projects as of 2015, which work to fight poverty, promote health, increase access to education and creative activities for youth, and protect the environment.[2] The foundation also has offices in Cairo, and Casablanca."
The Duke Endowment	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Duke_Endowment	"The Duke Endowment is a private foundation established in 1924 by industrialist and philanthropist James B. Duke.  The mission of the foundation is to serve the people of North Carolina and South Carolina by supporting selected programs of higher education, health care, children's welfare, and spiritual life.[2]
 James B. Duke endowed the foundation on December 11, 1924 with $40 million.  In the Indenture of Trust, Duke specified that he wanted the Endowment to support Duke University, Davidson College, Furman University, Johnson C. Smith University; not-for-profit hospitals and children's homes in the two Carolinas; and rural United Methodist churches in North Carolina, retired pastors, and their surviving families.  When Mr. Duke died in 1925, he left the Endowment an additional $67 million. Adjusted for present value, Mr. Duke's total gifts would amount to more than $1.3 billion today.
 The market value of the Endowment's assets have grown to $3.69 billion in 2017.  From 1924-2018, the Endowment has awarded over $3.7 billion in grants.[3]
 The Duke Endowment is a co-publisher, along with the North Carolina Institute of Medicine, of the North Carolina Medical Journal, a journal of health policy analysis and debate.[1]
 The Endowment was established by a trust indenture that specifies how the funds were to be used.  First, $6 million was to be used to either found a Duke University or to enhance Trinity College, located at Durham, North Carolina, if that school changed its name to Duke University within three months.  The remaining funds were to be invested (primarily in Duke Power Company) stock. Of the income generated annually by these funds, 20% were to be reinvested, each trustee was to receive 0.2%, and the rest was to be paid out in the following allocation:"
East Meets West	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Meets_West_(non-governmental_organization)	"Thrive Networks, also known as East Meets West is an international non-governmental organization pioneering evidence-based programs and technologies in health, water and sanitation, and education for underserved populations in Asia and Africa. It was founded in 1988 by author and humanitarian Le Ly Hayslip, and is based in Oakland, California, USA.[1]
 It operates in the fields of healthcare, education, and clean water and sanitation aiming to help people in Asia to achieve self-sufficiency.[2]
 Among the key programs are: providing low-income children with education, clean water and medical care, surgery program to heal heart defects in children (Operation Healthy Heart), scholarship program to improve educational outcomes (SPELL), dental program, support for children with disabilities, and a clean water and sanitation program.[3][4]
 In 2011, East Meets West invested over US$13 million on its programs. East Meets West has a four-star rating [5] and was listed as one of the ""10 Charities Expanding in a Hurry"" [6] on Charity Navigator.
 In 2014, EMW relaunched in the United States as Thrive Networks. 
 The Scholarship Program to Enhance Learning and Literacy (SPELL) program provides 10-year scholarships to children from Vietnam's poorest families. 
 The anti-trafficking ADAPT program, implemented by EMW's partner Pacific Links Foundation, works to stop trafficking at the source by providing vulnerable girls with resources.[clarification needed]
 The School Construction program builds primary schools and kindergartens in rural areas so more children can attend school. Vietnam does not have enough schools to meet the needs of its population EMW has also helped fill in the gaps in Vietnam's higher education system by building key educational facilities such as university libraries, research centers and sports complexes.
 Village of Hope is EMW's disadvantaged children's center that provides children from the most difficult circumstances with a safe haven where they receive a full education, job training and skills to help them reintegrate into society.[7]
 Through the healthcare programs, EMW provides direct assistance to individuals, supports families, trains medical staff and works to improve systemic capacity by developing and constructing improved medical facilities.
 The Breath of Life (BOL) neo-natal health program treats over 50,000 babies a year through appropriate technologies.  BOL provides custom-designed, low-cost equipment to hospitals, and targeted training to medical personnel, to save the lives of infants suffering from common newborn pathologies. To ensure sustainability, BOL works to strengthen linkages with local health authorities to involve them in integrating these technologies into the larger health system. EMW's neonatal health model was adapted and replicated to serve Laos, Cambodia, Timor Leste in 2008 and more recently in India, Myanmar and the Philippines.[8] BOL formed a major partnership with GE Healthcare in 2011.[9]
 The EMW Dental Program serves 15,000 Vietnamese children annually through its modern dental clinic, school dental trailer and rural outreach project that utilizes portable field equipment.[10] The program recently treated its 100,000th patient.
 The Operation Healthy Heart program addresses the most common birth defect, congenital heart disease, by providing lifesaving cardiac surgery to critically ill children. In addition, EMW provides training to medical staff in numerous hospitals.
 EMW provides a comprehensive support system for the disabled through its Support Network for People with Disabilities (SN-PWD) and its INSPIRE Sports program. Many of these disabilities are caused by exposure to Agent Orange and dioxin, an issue EMW is addressing through a new campaign of healing for Agent Orange survivors.
 EMW builds key medical institutions that are a crucial link between our grassroots development programs and large-scale capacity building. In the past decade, with major support from the Atlantic Philanthropies, EMW has invested over $50 million in building large-scale hospitals in Vietnam.[11]
 In 2015, Embrace, an organization founded at Stanford University in 2008 to treat newborns suffering from hypothermia, joins Thrive Networks’ healthcare programs. EMW/Thrive's health portfolio strategy and scope of work is refined to focus on newborn health.
 Through the Clean Water & Sanitation Program, EMW provides a sustainable water supply to communities and ensures that the local people are fully invested in the project. To maximize the health benefits, EMW incorporates a hygiene and sanitation training component to address the need for improved sanitation, another critical public health issue.[12]
 Accountability and results of the EMW water system model are insured by the Output-Based Approach, where funders such as the World Bank  provide reimbursement for a water system only after its functionality is tested and a requisite number of household connections verified. While most villagers pay for their monthly water usage, the program subsidizes the costs of pipe connections and fees for water delivery to the neediest through its “Poorest of the Poor” program.
 The program's critical sanitation component supports hygiene behavioral change by promoting awareness of practices such as hand washing, installing hand washing stations in schools and building hygienic latrines in communities with existing EMW water systems.
 To date, EMW has helped finance the construction of 12,500 latrines in partnership with Watershed Asia and USAID. Since the Clean Water & Sanitation Program's inception, EMW has built over 200 water systems and brought improved sanitation to almost 62,500 people.[13]
 EMW received a US$10.9 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to improve sanitation and hygiene practices among the rural poor in Vietnam and Cambodia.  EMW's program will benefit 1.7 million people in 344,000 households and 290 communes in Vietnam and Cambodia while working with local organizations, government partners, banks and private enterprises.[14] The grant uses a results-based approach to sanitation and hygiene aid, which requires an initial investment from recipient families and communes, and then rewards them when results are achieved.[15]
 EMW partners with government organizations, international organizations, foundations, local associations, hospitals, and educational institutions to enhance the quality of their programs and expand its scope and impact. Key partnerships include: GE Healthcare, Design that Matters, Blue Planet Network, VNHELP, Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs, Osprey Packs, Masimo, International Children Assistance Network (ICAN), Evidence Action, Design that Matters, MTTS, and Pacific Links.[16]
 EMW receives funding support from government agencies, foundations, corporations and individuals. Key funders include The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Global Partnership on Output-based aid, USAID, AusAID, Irish Aid, The Atlantic Philanthropies, The Lemelson Foundation,  The Ford Foundation, The Boeing Company, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,[17] Wellcome Trust and Dubai Cares.
 Thrive Networks/East Meets West is currently serving communities in nine countries throughout Asia and Africa, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, India, the Philippines, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Benin and Uganda.[18]
 East Meets West was established by Le Ly Hayslip, whose life story was chronicled in two books she wrote and in Oliver Stone's film, Heaven & Earth, based on her memoir When Heaven and Earth Changed Places. In 1988, she visited her native village in Ky La in Central Vietnam to begin healing of the war wounds and plant the seeds of reconciliation.
 From Le Ly's early projects - Mothers Love Pediatric Clinic and Peace Village Medical Center - East Meets West emerged as a respected non-governmental organization (NGO) in Vietnam, which realized many socially important projects in the country.
 In 1993, East Meets West received a grant from United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and constructed the Village of Hope, a shelter and safe haven for 136 needy children from Central Vietnam.
 Since 1998 the organization in partnership with Atlantic Philanthropies has participated in building of Vietnam's medical and educational infrastructure, including university libraries and general hospitals, including a 200-bed cardiovascular center in Huế and a twelve-story English Language training center in Da Nang.
 In 2003, John Anner left the Independent Press Association to head East Meets West.[19]
 In 2006, East Meets West co-organized medical equipment donation for Viet Duc Hospital in Hanoi.
 In 2008, EMW began its expansion to Laos, Cambodia, and Timor Leste, with subsequent programming in the Philippines, India, and Myanmar.
 In 2012, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation awarded East Meets West a US$10.9 million grant to improve sanitation and hygiene practices among the rural poor in Vietnam and Cambodia.[15]
 In 2013, EMW and Blue Planet Network signed a definitive agreement to merge, bringing together EMW's “pay for performance” water and sanitation programs and Blue Planet Network's online collaboration and impact analysis platform.[20]
 In 2014, EMW relaunched in the United States as Thrive Networks, but continues to operate as East Meets West in Asia. Thrive Networks adopts a new nonprofit business model: using mergers and shared ventures to increase impact.
 In 2015, after 13 years with EMW/Thrive Networks, John Anner stepped down as CEO. The organization welcomed a new management team that is committed to evidence-based impact and strategic focus.
 In 2016, EMW Vietnam welcomed new Country Director, Loan Duong. Thrive Networks renews its focus on conducting and commissioning rigorous evaluations and impact research."
Edhi Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edhi_Foundation	"The Edhi Foundation (Urdu: ایدھی فاؤنڈیشن) is a non-profit social welfare program in Pakistan, founded by Abdul Sattar Edhi[4] in 1951.
Edhi until his death on 8 July 2016 was the head of the organization and his wife Bilquis, a nurse, oversees the maternity and adoption services of the foundation. Its headquarters are in Karachi, Pakistan.
 The Edhi Foundation provides 24-hour emergency assistance across the nation of Pakistan and abroad. The Foundation provides, among many other services, shelter for the destitute, free hospitals and medical care, drug rehabilitation services, and national and international relief efforts. Its main focuses are Emergency Services, Orphans, Handicapped Persons, Shelters, Education, Healthcare, International Community Centers, Blood & Drug Bank, air ambulance services, Marine And Coastal Services.
 In 1951 Abdul Sattar Edhi bought a small shop in Mithadar area of Karachi and opened a free dispensary. From that small beginning Edhi has built up the Edhi Foundation. Edhi established his first welfare center in 1957 and then the Edhi Trust.[5] What started as one man operating from a single room in Karachi is now the Edhi Foundation. The foundation has over 300 centers across the country, in big cities, small towns and remote rural areas, providing medical aid, family planning and emergency assistance. They own air ambulances, providing quick access to far-flung areas.
 In Karachi alone, the Edhi Foundation runs 8 hospitals providing free medical care, eye hospitals, diabetic centres, surgical units, a 4- bed cancer hospital and mobile dispensaries. In addition to these the Foundation also manages two blood banks in Karachi. As with other Edhi services, employed professionals and volunteers run these. The foundation has a Legal aid department, which provides free services and has secured the release of countless innocent prisoners. Commissioned doctors visit jails on a regular basis and also supply food and other essentials to the inmates. There are 15 "" Apna Ghar"" [""Our Home""] homes for the destitute children, runaways, and psychotics.
 On 25 June 2013, Edhi's kidneys failed; it was announced that he would be on dialysis for the rest of his life unless he found a kidney donor. Edhi died on 8 July 2016 at the age of 88 due to kidney failure after having been placed on a ventilator. His last wishes included the request that his organs were to be donated but due to his ill health, only his corneas were suitable. He was laid to rest at the Edhi Village Karachi.
 The foundation also has an education scheme, which apart from teaching reading and writing covers various vocational activities such as driving, pharmacy and para-medical training. The emphasis is on self-sufficiency. The Edhi Foundation has branches in several countries where they provide relief to refugees in the United States, UK, Canada, Japan, and Bangladesh. In 1991 the Foundation provided aid to victims of the Gulf war and earthquake victims in Iran and Egypt.
The organization has held the Guinness record for world's ""largest volunteer ambulance organization"" since 1997.[6] In 2016, after the death of Abdul Sattar Edhi, the state bank of Pakistan urged bank CEOs to donate to the foundation.[7]
 The Edhi Foundation provides a number of services, emergency and non-emergency, to the general public. In addition to emergency medical services and private ambulance services, the organization also renders aid to women and children in need, assists with missing persons cases, and helps in covering burial and graveyard costs of unclaimed and unidentified bodies during times of disaster and tragedy.[8]
 As of March 2016, the Edhi Foundation owns over 1,800 private ambulance vans stationed in areas across Pakistan.[8] The ambulance dispatchers in Karachi, one of the busiest cities in Pakistan, have reported up to 6,000 calls a day, with the average response time for each incident falling within 10 minutes.[9] It was also an Edhi ambulance which responded to and picked up the body of the American journalist, Daniel Pearl, when he was killed in 2002.[9]
 The organization also owns two private jets and one helicopter to assist in moving victims from hard-to-reach locations, especially during the event of a natural disaster.[10] In addition to land and air assistance, Edhi Foundation also hosts 28 rescue boats to aid during floods and in cases of shipwrecks and disaster along the Arabian Ocean coast.[11]
 The organization runs several private outpatient hospitals located in Pakistan. Additional medical facilities include a diabetic center, a nurse training center, immunization centers, and blood banks, including emergency banks during times of natural disasters or tragedies.[7]
 Bilquis Edhi, co-head of the Edhi Foundation, is responsible for overseeing children's and women's services within the organization. Services she heads currently for children include the jhoola project, a child adoption center, and an abandoned children's welfare center. Jhoola is the Urdu word for ""cradle"",[12] and refers to a baby hatch for abandoned children. Most of the Edhi emergency centers have a jhoola located outside the venue for mothers to leave their infants, regardless of the current situation they may be in.[13] These children are taken into custody and are taken care of, often being adopted by pre-screened families.
 The Edhi Foundation has reached out to international communities and assisted with the setup of several offices overseas which assist with donations, fundraising, and especially financially aiding Pakistanis who have to be flown overseas for urgent medical attention.[citation needed] In addition to providing their regular services, the overseas foundation offices often help with community needs as necessary. In 2005, the Edhi Foundation provided $100,000 in aid to relief efforts following Hurricane Katrina.[9]"
Engineers Without Borders	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineers_Without_Borders	"The term Engineers Without Borders (EWB) (Français: Ingénieurs sans frontières, ISF) is used by a number of non-governmental organizations in various countries to describe their activity based on engineering and oriented to international development work. All of these groups work worldwide to serve the needs of disadvantaged communities and people through engineering projects.[1]
Many EWB national groups are developed independently from each other, and so they are not all formally affiliated with each other, and their level of collaboration and organizational development varies. The majority of the EWB/ISF organizations are strongly linked to academia and to students, with many of them being student-led.[2]
 The first organizations to bear the name were Ingénieurs Sans Frontières (ISF)-France, founded in the 1980s, and ISF-Spain and ISF-Italy, founded in the 1990s. EWB-Canada, one of the largest of the EWB organizations, was founded in the late 1990s. EWB-UK was founded with the support of EWB-Canada in 2001.[3]
 In the USA an organization called EWB-USA was founded at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2001 by Bernard Amadei. Amadei founded the organization after working in Belize and Costa-Rica. The original chapter of EWB-USA is still a functioning chapter at the University of Colorado, working in Northern Rwanda (Although the University now has several EWB-USA chapters, the Rwanda chapter was the original). In the same year an organization called Engineers Without Frontiers USA was founded at Cornell University. This organization was later renamed Engineers for a Sustainable World following a dispute with EWB-USA over the name.[4]
 Engineers Without Borders – International
 Members of EWB-International:
 Not members of EWB-International:
 Several of the EWB/ISF organizations are affiliated with the organization Engineers Without Borders - International (EWB-I). EWB-I is an association of national EWB/ISF groups with the mission to facilitate collaboration, exchange of information, and assistance among its member groups. EWB-I was founded in 2004 by Prof. Bernard Amadei, the founder of EWB-USA.[5][6]
 Several other older EWB/ISF groups are not members of EWB-I, for a variety of reasons. EWB Canada, for example, states: ""An organization is more than just a name and roughly similar goals. In order to work together, the organizations must have a common strategy and culture, neither of which are currently present in the international network.""[7]  Many of the organizations which are not EWB-I members, such as EWB-Canada, ISF-Spain, EWB-UK, and others, do collaborate with each other and with other similar groups.[2]
 Researchers have identified different levels of community member participation, such as passive participation, initiative and leadership, and decision making in projects across the globe.[8] In order to have a true impact, students, professionals, and communities are given clearly identified roles for their participation in the project. The students' role consists of being open and willing to learn from the problems at hand and the methodologies used in the projects. Professional engineers are expected to fill the role of technical experts in the proven methods that are used and to communicate with students and community members. The communities are given the role of communicating with the assisting engineers and are actively encouraged to take participatory and leadership roles in the decision making of the project methodology.[9] Education is a major part of Engineers without Borders and all participants are expected to learn from one another. The three levels of participation which are used by Engineers without Borders are as follows: low (monetary contribution), middle (manual labor), and high (decision making and leadership positions).  All of these roles are considered to be important for the projects to be successful.[8][10]
 Most Engineers without Borders projects focus on water and deal with sanitation,  distribution, and management of water sources.[11] One example of a completed water project is the River Basin Management project in Palestine. River management can be very important in situations where the river provides the only source of drinking water.[12] Projects of this nature can be extremely difficult, as the presence of biological barriers can prevent workers from making major environmental changes. Because of this, it can make it difficult to quantify the effectiveness of Engineers without Borders projects.[13][12]
 As educators in the Engineering field, teachers play a large role in the projects by Engineers without Borders.  There are many examples of the ways in which Engineers without Borders takes on the challenge of educating students.  These examples are explained in studies that focus on types of study abroad programs (such as EWB) that currently exist and the best practices that have been found in the programs.[14] One graduate class of nine students who study design, engineering, technology, were taught about science education programs and service learning in hopes to bridge the gap between males and females as currently the engineering field is dominated by males with only 11% of the workforce being female. This class was taught in order to shine a light onto the gender inequality issues in the Engineering field.[15] The programs have their challenges, such as lack of faculty interest and involvement.[16]
 Engineers Without Borders has created a way to train engineering students in technical and nontechnical skills. The model of education that Engineers Without Borders uses is called service learning, which consists of students getting experience by building infrastructure in struggling 3rd world communities. This model builds on academic literature that claims engineering professions should focus on sustainability. One example of this model of teaching was the Engineering in Developing Countries (EDC) program at the University of Colorado at Boulder.  The program had students from both engineering and non-engineering disciplines address a wide range of issues such as water provisioning, food production, health, and shelter.[17]  There are an increasing rate of cases where students create prototypes by using natural resources including wood, mud, and the land itself.  Wood Science is an accredited field in the engineering world; and one example of wood science being active is a pilot program called ""Wood Scientists Without Borders"" which was established with a goal to encourage more engineering students to participate in wood science. This program has worked closely with Engineers without Borders to build infrastructure out of wood and use the resources that are provided in the natural world.[18] Another example of students using natural resources is through mud brick constructions which consist of cost savings, thermal mass, eco friendliness, self-satisfaction, and aesthetics.   Mud bricks have become a process and method for engineering students to help build and rebuild communities that have been destroyed by natural or manmade disasters. In 2009 it was found that using mud bricks to rebuild houses that were destroyed in ways such as ecological degradation, natural disasters, or political turmoil, was a cheap and efficient way to rebuild infrastructure; and today 30% of the world's present population live in earthen structures.[19]  Director of Engineering Service Corps of the USA - Engineers Without Borders, El-Omari presented a re-construction project to the United Nations where Engineers Without Borders would use the area behind the living areas of refugees to dig wells and bring water to the Ein Sultan Refugee camp.[20] According to the Engineers without Borders website, they work with students to bridge the gap between the learning environment in schools and the ""real"" world problems that are found in today's world.[21]"
Epilepsy Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy_Foundation	"The Epilepsy Foundation, also Epilepsy Foundation of America (EFA), is a non-profit national foundation, headquartered in Landover, Maryland, dedicated to the welfare of people with epilepsy and seizure disorders. The foundation was established in 1968 and now has a network of 59 affiliates.  The foundation's programs aim to ""ensure that people with seizures are able to participate in all life experiences; and to prevent, control and cure epilepsy through research, education, advocacy and services.""
 The Epilepsy Foundation came into existence as the result of a merger of the Epilepsy Association of America and the Epilepsy Foundation in 1967. It has since been joined by the National Epilepsy League. In December 2012, it merged with The Epilepsy Therapy Project. The new mission of the Foundation is to ""stop seizures and SUDEP, find a cure and overcome the challenges created by epilepsy through efforts including education, advocacy and research to accelerate ideas into therapies"".[1] Programs included educational, counseling, referral, and employment assistance. In addition the EFA has advisory and youth programs, training grants and programs.
 On March 28, 2008, Wired News reported that ""Internet griefers""—a slang term for people whose only interests are in harassing others[2]—assaulted an epilepsy support forum run by the Epilepsy Foundation of America.[3] JavaScript code and flashing computer animations were posted to trigger migraine headaches and seizures in people with photosensitive or pattern-sensitive epilepsy.[3] According to Wired News, circumstantial evidence suggested that the attack was perpetrated by Anonymous users, with the initial attack posts on the epilepsy forum blaming eBaum's World. Members of the epilepsy forum claimed they had found a thread in which the attack was being planned at 7chan.org, an imageboard that has been described as a stronghold for Anonymous. The thread, like all old threads eventually do on these types of imageboards, has since cycled to deletion.[3]
 RealTechNews[unreliable source?] reported that the forum at the United Kingdom-based National Society for Epilepsy was also subjected to an identical attack. It stated that ""apparent members of Anonymous"" had denied responsibility for both attacks and posted that it had been the Church of Scientology who carried them out.[4] News.com.au reported that the administrators of 7chan.org had posted an open letter claiming that the attacks had been carried out by the Church of Scientology ""to ruin the public opinion of Anonymous, to lessen the effect of the lawful protests against their virulent organization"" under the Church's fair game policy.[2] The church has previously been involved in false flag operations to frame and discredit groups or peoples it disagrees with such as Operation Freakout and Gabe Cazares.[improper synthesis?][citation needed]
 The Tech Herald[unreliable source?] reported that when the attack began, posts referenced multiple groups, including Anonymous. The report attributes the attack to a group named ""The Internet Hate Machine"" (a reference to the KTTV Fox 11 news report), who claim to be part of Anonymous, but are not the same faction that are involved in the campaign against Scientology.[5] Some Anonymous participants of Project Chanology suggest that the perpetrators are Internet users who merely remained anonymous in the literal sense, and thus had no affiliation with the larger anti-Scientology efforts attributed to Anonymous.[5] During an interview with CNN, Scientologist Tommy Davis accused Anonymous of hacking into the Epilepsy Foundation website to make it display imagery intended to cause epileptic seizures. Interviewer John Roberts contended the FBI said that it ""found nothing to connect this group Anonymous (with these actions),"" and that it also has ""no reason to believe that these charges will be leveled against this group.""[6] The response was that the matter was on the hands of local law enforcement and that there were ongoing investigations.[6]
 According to the Wall Street Journal, the foundation, with its local affiliates, has been lobbying for state laws in 25 states that would prevent pharmacists from substituting generic epilepsy drugs for brand-name drugs unless the pharmacist had written consent of the physician or patient. The pharmaceutical industry has also been lobbying state legislatures for the change, and working with the foundation.
 The pharmaceutical industry spent $8.8 million in state campaign contributions in 2006. In its annual report, the Epilepsy Foundation reported that it got $500,000 to $999,999 from GlaxoSmithKline, and $100,000 to $499,999 from each of Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson. Representatives of four pharmaceutical companies sit on the Epilepsy Foundation's board, as does Billy Tauzin, head of PhRMA, which gave $25,000 to $49,999. The Foundation denied that pharmaceutical funding had anything to do with its support of the laws.
 Generic drug substitution is significant, according to the Journal, because four major branded drugs, with $5 billion revenue last year, will be going off-patent by 2010. (The five best-selling drugs are Topamax, Lamictal, Lyrica, Keppra and Depakote.) Pharmacists can now substitute generics, because every generic drug, in order to be approved, has to demonstrate that it is equivalent to the branded drug.
 The Epilepsy Foundation received anecdotal reports of patients experiencing seizures and side effects after switching drugs, and tried to convince the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999 that there was a problem, but the FDA decided there was no evidence. In 2006, the Foundation convened a committee of medical experts, and its own experts also found no evidence. Nonetheless, the Foundation recommended that doctors be required to give permission to switch to generics.[7][8]"
Epilepsy Outlook	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy_Outlook	"Epilepsy Outlook is a charity based in Hartlepool which provides free and confidential practical support, advice and information for people with epilepsy and their carers.[4]
Their support services include supported volunteer placements, a drop-in centre, epilepsy awareness training, an art therapy group and welfare benefits advice. Each year it provides placements for 50 volunteers on the volunteer development programme, 280 people receive advice, including at least 100 carers. 50 plus people receive epilepsy awareness training. 6 people use their drop-in each week.[5] The services are provided for people across the North-East area.
In September–October 2014, Epilepsy Outlook's headquarters, advice centre and art club moved around the corner to larger premises in The Arches, Park Road.[6]
 Epilepsy Outlook runs three charity shops where they sell donated items:

 As well as their charity shops and advice centre they run special fund raising campaigns including, most recently, for a sensory room for Callum Smith.[7]
By September 5, 2013 the total stood at £10,184[8] and raised a total of £14,000.[6]
It was a campaign in which three McDonald's restaurants got involved,[9][10] raising £2,289,[8][11] and Hartlepool's High Tunstall College of Science donated over £5,000 worth of sensory equipment including multi-coloured fibre optic lights, bubble machines and specialist chairs.[12]
 Before that they ran a campaign for a tumble form chair for two-year-old Talia Foster.[13]
 The charity is structured into volunteers, a management committee and trustees.[1]"
Eppley Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eppley_Foundation	"The Eugene C. Eppley Foundation was founded in Omaha, Nebraska.  Founded by Omaha hotel magnate Eugene C. Eppley, the foundation was the leading benefactor for several charities and institutions in the Midwestern United States.  (This is not to be confused with the Eppley Foundation for Research, which primarily supports advanced postdoctoral research in the physical and biological sciences.  The latter was founded by Marion Eppley, and its offices are based in New York City.) [1]
 Beginning in 1949, the Eppley Foundation contributed to a variety of educational, healthcare and civic endeavors.  Eppley was a longtime friend of Dr. Milo Bail, the president of the Omaha University from 1948 until 1965.  During that time the Eppley Foundation gave more than $1.2 million to the university. After Eppley's passing, the Eppley Foundation donated another $50,000 to recruit distinguished professors. The Eppley Library (now the Administration building) at the University of Nebraska at Omaha was named in recognition of the Foundation's giving.[2][3]
 In the 1950s, the foundation donated a substantial amount of the costs to build the Gene Eppley Boys Club located on North 24th Street in North Omaha.[4]  In 1960 the foundation donated $1 million to the city to convert the Omaha Municipal Airport to a jet port to better connect to the rest of the nation. It was renamed Eppley Airfield in his honor.[5]
 In the 1970s the foundation funded Eppley Fellowships at the Smithsonian Institution for research in a variety of issues.[6]  The Eugene C. Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases was dedicated in 1963 at the University of Nebraska College of Medicine with a $2,500,000 grant from the Eppley Foundation.[7]  In 1967 the Eppley Foundation gave $2,250,000 to the City of Omaha and Douglas County to build a new city-county office building in downtown.
 The Eppley Foundation led the way for giving to a number of educational institutions in the Midwest.  Outside of the namesake family, it was the leading benefactor of the Culver Academies in Indiana, where Eppley had studied.[8]  It was also the largest donor ever to the University of Nebraska at Omaha.[9]
 Properties currently or formerly named after Eugene C. Eppley because of donations by his foundation include:"
Eye Care Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_Care_Foundation	"Eye Care Foundation (ECF) is an international charity organisation active in over 20 countries in Asia[3] and Africa.[4][5]
 ECF was founded when Eyecare Worldwide and Mekong Eye Doctors joined forces in 2008.[6] The two organizations shared the same objectives and working together as the current foundation has proved to be more efficient and effective.
 Eyecare Worldwide (1984) was founded by a Dutch ophthalmologist who was moved by the plight of the high number of people who suffered from blindness that could be cured or even prevented. 
Mekong Eye Doctors (1993) was founded by a Dutch biochemist after he had been in Thailand to conduct eye research.
 Eye Care Foundation has offices and hospitals in the Himalayan region (Nepal), Southeast Asia (Vietnam[7], Cambodia, Laos) and Africa (Tanzania).[8]"
Feeding America	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_America	"Feeding America is a United States–based nonprofit organization that is a nationwide network of more than 200 food banks that feed more than 46 million people through food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other community-based agencies.[1] It is the third largest U.S. charity.[2] Feeding America was known as America's Second Harvest until August 31, 2008.[3]
 In the late 1960s, when John van Hengel, a retired businessman in Phoenix, Arizona began volunteering at a local soup kitchen, he began soliciting food donations for the kitchen. He ended up with far more food than the kitchen could use in its operations. Around this time, he spoke with one of the clients, who told him that she regularly fed her family with discarded items from the grocery store's garbage bins.  She told him that the food quality was fine, but that there should be a place where unwanted food could be stored and later accessed by people who needed it, similar to how banks store money.
 Van Hengel began to actively solicit this unwanted food from grocery stores, local gardens, and nearby produce farms.  His effort led to the creation of St. Mary's Food Bank in Phoenix, the nation's first food bank.[4]
 In 1975, St. Mary's was given a federal grant to assist in developing food banks across the nation.  This effort was formally incorporated into a separate non-profit organization in 1976.[5]
 In 2001, America's Second Harvest merged with Foodchain,[6] which was the nation's largest food-rescue organization at that time.
 In 2005, Feeding America began using an internal market with an artificial currency called ""shares"" to more rationally allocate food. Currency is allocated based on the need, and then individual banks bid on which foods they want the most, based on local knowledge and ability to transport and store the food offered.[7]  Negative prices are possible, so banks could earn shares by picking up undesirable food. The previous centrally planned system had penalized banks for refusing any food offered, even if it was the wrong type to meet their needs, and this resulted in misallocations (""sending potatoes to Idaho""), food rotted away in places that didn't need it, and the wrong types of food being delivered (e.g. not matching hot dogs with hot dog buns).[8]
 In May 2007, it was featured on American Idol, named as a charity in the Idol Gives Back charity program.[9]
 In September 2008, the organization name was changed to Feeding America.[10]
 In August 2009, Columbia Records announced that all U.S. royalties from Bob Dylan's album Christmas in the Heart would be donated to Feeding America, in perpetuity.[citation needed]
 There has been a rise in the numbers suffering from hunger since the financial crisis of 2007–2008. In 2013, the USDA reported that about 49 million U.S. Americans were now facing the condition, about one in six of the population.[11] In September,  they launched Hunger Action Month, with events planned all over the nation, to raise awareness and get more U.S. Americans involved in helping out.[12][13][14]
 In 2015, Feeding America saved more than 2 billion pounds (~907 metric tons) of food that would have been thrown away otherwise, but could instead be distributed to hungry families.[15]
 Feeding America works to educate the general public and keep them informed about hunger in America. The national office produces educational and research papers that spotlight aspects of hunger and provides information on hunger, poverty and the programs that serve vulnerable Americans. Feeding America's public policy staff works with legislators, conducting research, testifying at hearings and advocating for changes in public attitudes and laws that support Feeding America's network and those the organization serves.[16]
 In 2017, Feeding America announced a plan to increase the nutritional value of food from food banks. By 2023, the group plans to offer more fruits and vegetables, and provide training so they can distribute more produce, whole grains and lean proteins.[17]
 There are more than 200 Feeding America food banks, each of which is ""notable"" for the work it does in its own area. A complete and current, list is available at the Feeding America web site. These are just a few of the banks in the network:"
Feed My Starving Children	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_My_Starving_Children	"Feed My Starving Children is a Christian non-profit organization that coordinates the packaging and distribution of food to people in developing nations. Founded in 1987, it has reached out to more than 70 countries.[1]
 Richard Proudfit, a Minneapolis business man and philanthropist, founded the organization after visiting Honduras after a hurricane. Proudfit witnessed starving children dying all around him and was moved to start Feed My Starving Children in 1987. Proudfit risked his life in war zones around the world to feed starving children. Proudfit died November 13th, 2018. Together with his second foundation Kids Against Hunger, the two organizations feed over 1 billion children annually. Proudfit received the Jefferson Award for Public Service in 2012 joining the ranks of Bill Gates and Paul Newman.[2]
 The organization recruits volunteers including school children to assist in packing. They also employ paid staff to supervise the operations.[3]"
FINCA International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FINCA_International	"FINCA International is a non-profit, microfinance organization, founded by John Hatch in 1984. Sometimes referred to as the ""World Bank for the Poor"",[1] FINCA is the innovator of the village banking methodology in microcredit and is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of modern-day microfinance. With its headquarters in Washington, D.C., FINCA has 20 affiliated host-country institutions (affiliates), in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, Eurasia and the Middle East and South Asia. Along with Grameen Bank and Accion International, FINCA is considered to be one of the most influential microfinance organizations in the world.[2]
 In 1984, Hatch, a Fulbright-trained economist and international development expert, conceived a new method for delivering assistance to the poor. In an airplane high above the Andes, Hatch was en route to a consultant assignment in Bolivia, when inspiration struck. He grabbed in-flight cocktail napkins, scraps of paper, and a pen and began writing down ideas, equations, and flow charts as fast as he could. By the time he landed in La Paz, he had the outline of a radically different approach to poverty alleviation: a financial services program that put the poor in charge. “Give poor communities the opportunity, and then get out of the way!” he said. He called the idea ""village banking"".[3] This approach gave the poor the opportunity to obtain loans without collateral-the poor's main obstacle to accessing credit—at market-level interest rates.
 Hatch first had to convince a group of USAID officers that his epiphany would pay off—for the rural poor and the government of the United States, whose grant dollars would fund the first projects. Remarkably, the officials liked his innovative idea and provided an initial grant of $1 million. Hatch and his Peruvian business partner, Aquiles Lanao, launched the program in five separate geographical areas of Bolivia and within four weeks, they had created funds in 280 villages serving 14,000 families with loans worth $630,000. Hatch's clients in Bolivia were puzzled at first by village banking because it represented a significant departure from business as usual. They were intrigued enough to try it, however, and it was an immediate success. When Hatch's client in Bolivia changed its in-country team, the new representatives shut the program down. More cautious than the original client team, the new group acknowledged the program's success but still felt that uncollateralized lending to very poor people was too risky. Undeterred, Hatch spent the next few months training others in the village banking methodology, helping open new programs throughout Latin America, and building the institution that would come to be known as FINCA International. FINCA incorporated in 1985.[4] The name is an acronym that stands for “Foundation for International Community Assistance.”[5]
 Its ability to achieve financial sustainability allowed FINCA to make considerable expansions in the 1980s and 1990s in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Newly Independent States of the Former Soviet Union. In 1995, FINCA entered the former Soviet Union by establishing a Village Banking program in Kyrgyzstan.[6] In 1997, FINCA co-sponsored the first Microcredit Summit, with over 2,000 policymakers, practitioners, and donors discussing ways to expand microcredit programs.[7] In 2000, FINCA became one of the first economic development organizations to enter Kosovo after the June 1999 cease-fire.[7] In the 2000s, FINCA continued its penetration into the Newly Independent States by establishing new programs in Central Asia. Its most recent programs were launched in Afghanistan, in 2004 (see FINCA Afghanistan), and Jordan in 2007. In April 2009, FINCA Kyrgyzstan became the second program to pass the 100,000 client mark.[8]
 The mission of FINCA International is ""to alleviate poverty through lasting solutions that help people build assets, create jobs and raise their standard of living.""[3] Today, FINCA's reaches 2.3 million clients worldwide, including borrowers and savers.[9]
 The premise of its mission is to have a systematic and generational impact on poverty by making business loans available to poor women on a massive scale. According to Rupert Scofield, FINCA's President and CEO, ""women have historically proved to be better credit risks, as they tend to be more responsible, perhaps from having to take care of the children. And frankly, they tend to be more creative and risk-taking than the men. Because they manage the household money, they know where the returns are in the marketplace on any given day.""
 Pioneered by FINCA, village banking is arguably the world’s most widely imitated microfinance methodology.[10]  Among US-based non-profit agencies alone there are at least 31 microfinance institutions (MFIs) that have collectively created over 400 village banking programs in at least 90 countries. And in many of these countries there are host-country MFIs—sometimes dozens—that are village banking practitioners as well.[10]
 A village bank is an informal self-help support group of 9-30 members, predominantly female heads-of-household. These women meet once a week to avail themselves of working capital loans, a safe place to save, skill training, mentoring, and motivation. Loans can be as small as $50–$100 and are linked to savings such that the more a client saves the more she can borrow.  The normal loan period is four months and is repaid in 16 weekly installments.[10]
 As with many other microcredit methodologies, village banking eliminates collateral (the poor man's obstacle to receiving commercial bank loans) as a loan prerequisite. Instead, it relies on a system of cross-guarantees, where each member of a village bank ensures the loan of every other member. This system gives rise to an atmosphere of social pressure within the village bank, where the cost of social embarrassment motivates bank members to repay their loans in full. The admixture of cross-guarantees and social pressure makes it possible for even the poorest people to receive loans. This method has proven very effective for FINCA, yielding a repayment rate of over 97% in its worldwide network.[11]
 Market interest rates apply to village bank loans, usually matching what local commercial banks charge their customers[10] but usually only a tiny fraction of the usurious rates charged by local moneylenders. The capital for these loans is provided by FINCA with on-time weekly installment repayments collectively guaranteed by all members—i.e., a shortfall by one member must be covered by other group members. Village banks are highly democratic, self-managed, grassroots organizations. They elect their own leaders, select their own members, create their own bylaws, do their own bookkeeping, manage all funds, disburse and deposit all funds, resolve loan delinquency problems, and levy their own fines on members who come late, miss meetings, or fall behind in their payments.[10]
 Worldwide FINCA’s 20 affiliates have about 10,000 staff, of which the majority are field staff (loan officers and supervisors). Each loan officer attends the monthly meeting of each of her 10-15 village banks to coach its leadership committee and monitor the bank’s activities. In addition to motivation and adult education, the loan officer supervises client attendance, monitors bookkeeping accuracy, checks the accuracy of the current week’s loan and savings collections, and checks when the deposit receipt of the previous meeting. In turn, each village bank is managed by its elected officers—a president (who leads the bank’s democratic decision-making process), secretary (who takes attendance and keeps minutes) and a treasurer (responsible for accurately handling all cash transactions). Finally, each village banker has her own passbook, and her recorded balances of loan payments and savings deposits must always be the same as those recorded in the treasurer’s record for each client.[10]
 To expand access to capital, many of FINCA's subsidiaries have transformed into licensed, regulated, micro-deposit taking institutions (i.e. “microbanks”), in order to mobilize savings from its clients.[12] Access to client deposits will afford FINCA programs greater independence from donor and government funding, attract private investment and improve financial sector stability.
 FINCA International, which is a nonprofit organization, will retain majority ownership of these transformed institutions through FINCA Microfinance Holding Company LLC, to ensure that the banks remain focused on FINCA’s mission to serve the world’s poor.
 In 2010, FINCA transformed its business model by launching FINCA Microfinance Holding Company LLC., the first-of-its-kind socially responsible investment partnership for microfinance.[13] FINCA operates with a unique, integrated business model that accepts donations and investment dollars. Its approach leverages available capital and promotes greater transparency, sustainability and higher standards of business practices. The new business model allows FINCA to achieve balanced financial and social performance that is unmatched in the industry.
 While the original village bank credit and savings program remains the core product in the African programs, FINCA has partnered with leading insurance companies to offer health and life insurance products, health care, and business-interruption coverage in response to the AIDS crisis occurring in Africa. FINCA Uganda, which is a world pioneer in microinsurance, has partnered with AIG to provide life insurance, to ensure that the death of a village bank member does not result in hardship for the other village bank members or the family of the deceased as the client's loan is paid off. Generous funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is making it possible for FINCA and the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health's Center for Communication Programs to provide HIV/AIDS prevention education by using FINCA Malawi's established network of village bank groups.[14]
 In most countries in Africa, mobile phone use and point-of-service payment technologies are widespread. FINCA is applying new technologies and approaches to reach clients in new ways, improve their services, and bring down costs. For example, FINCA has launched mobile banking and agency banking in many of the African subsidiaries, to reach the remote and allow clients to easily access their accounts.[15]
 In Eurasia, FINCA's product offerings have expanded to include larger, individual loans, collateralized by office or specialized equipment, vehicles, or property.
 On January 24, 2004, USAID, FINCA and Visa International launched a major public-private partnership that aims to bring new efficiency and security to microfinance clients in the developing world utilizing electronic payment products. The partnership has tested how Visa solutions can provide FINCA and its clients both cost- and time-saving processes, allowing FINCA to expand its outreach to more of the world's poor by minimizing loan transaction times for both clients and microfinance providers; lowering transaction costs for processing loans; providing microfinance clients more secure access to their loan capital; reducing the possibility of cash theft; expanding the variety of financial service products available to FINCA's clients; and introducing a new market segment to participating commercial banks.[16]
 In November 2006, FINCA Afghanistan received a $10 million grant from USAID as part of an $80 million rural microfinance project to promote development and stability in Afghanistan. The project, the Agriculture, Rural Investment and Enterprise Strengthening (ARIES) Program, will also complement USAID's existing Alternative Livelihoods Program and will help establish a market-based, wholesale Rural Investment Fund to provide financing to cooperatives, farmers' associations, and small and midsize enterprises throughout the country, in a push to eradicate the cultivation of opium poppies.[17]
 Since establishing its program in Afghanistan, FINCA has offered a line of sharia-compliant microfinance products, developed after careful vetting with local religious leaders, and confirmed through a fatwa acquired from Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt (the world’s most respected Islamic institution of higher learning). Its current line of murabaha loan products is based on an agreement where the seller (FINCA) expressly mentions the cost he has incurred on the commodities to be sold and sells it to another person (the client) by adding a markup on the original cost, which is known to the buyer. It is one of the most popular modes of exchange used by banks in Islamic countries, such as Afghanistan, to promote interest-free transactions (interest being forbidden by Islamic law. Aside from being Afghanistan’s first sharia-compliant microfinance organization, FINCA Afghanistan can perhaps claim to have created the world’s first murabaha group-lending products.
 In May 2009, FINCA, in partnership with HSBC, launched an innovative, prepaid card in Mexico. As part of that initiative, FINCA has presented two case studies on the development and implementation of new products, strategies, technologies, and other innovations in the provision of financial services for microfinance clients in the developing world.[18]
 In July 2013, The MasterCard Foundation and FINCA Canada entered into a 4.5 year, $12.7 million partnership to significantly scale up financial inclusion in Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia. During this period, FINCA will establish new delivery channels to deliver products to rural and underserved communities. In addition, support will allow FINCA to provide training that helps staff shift their orientation from credit-centric products to a broader range of financial services including savings, and further embed social performance metrics into every aspect of FINCA’s operations.[19]
 Also in 2013, BrightLife (FINCA Plus, LLC) was established in Uganda.[20] This social enterprise by FINCA provides distribution and end-user financing for basic service products, including solar home systems, cookstoves and other appliances that improve daily life.[21] BrightLife products are made affordable to low-income customers through pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) financing, and they have been shown to help create healthier and safer homes, increase productivity, reduce household expenses and provide additional income-generating opportunities.[22]
 In August 2018, FINCA launched FINCA Ventures, an impact investing initiative that provides patient capital and pre- and post-investment support to help early-stage social enterprises achieve growth and scale. FINCA Ventures grew out of FINCA’s mission and recognition that access to basic services requires access to finance and that both are essential to alleviating poverty. The initiative supports innovative solutions to poverty in energy, water and sanitation (WASH), education, health, agriculture and financial technology (fintech).[23] As of August 2019, FINCA Ventures has invested in seven early-stage social enterprises, including Amped Innovation, BioLite, Eneza Education, Good Nature Agro, Ignitia, MDaaS Global and Sanivation.[24]
 In partnership with USAID’s Partnering to Accelerate Entrepreneurship (PACE) Initiative, FINCA announced the launch of FINCA Forward in October 2018. FINCA Forward is an innovation platform that facilitates collaboration between early-stage fintech enterprises and microfinance institutions supporting the world’s poor. The platform embraces the vital role of small and growing fintech businesses in driving economic growth, creating jobs and advancing market-based solutions to address global challenges in financial inclusion.[25]
 In 2003, Her Majesty Queen Rania of Jordan accepted an invitation from FINCA International to join its board of directors, formalizing a relationship of support and advocacy that began in 2000. In accepting the invitation, the Queen reaffirmed her belief in FINCA's vision that microfinance institutions offer a tangible means of providing large numbers of the world's poorest a real stake in their societies.[26] On February 25, 2008, Queen Rania officially inaugurated the FINCA Jordan program and personally visited its clients.[27]
 International film actress Natalie Portman joined FINCA as its ""Ambassador of Hope"" in 2003, following a meeting with Queen Rania. About the meeting, she explains, ""Because I'm Israeli and Queen Rania is probably the most high-profile Palestinian woman in the world, I had this dream of meeting with her and doing something that would promote peace and working together between Israeli and Palestinian women. She talked to me a lot about what she calls the 'hope gap' that exists between the one third of the world that has and the two thirds that do not. I wasn't even aware that two thirds of the world population are extremely poor, living on less than a dollar a day, and that 70 percent of those people are women and children. It's not something they teach you in school in the States"". Since then, Portman has visited FINCA field projects in Mexico, Guatemala, Uganda, and Ecuador, and met with several members of Congress to argue for more government funding for microfinance ventures.[28]
Portman appeared in the documentary FINCA Mexico: Stories of Hope, chronicling her visit to the FINCA program in Mexico.[29] The film was directed by Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize-winner documentary director Juan Carlos Rulfo. Portman created the film to provide FINCA supporters a more in-depth view of the program and to showcase the lives of FINCA clients.[30]
 Of her trip to Uganda, Portman recalls, ""...in Uganda I met a woman named Efuwa who was one of the first clients of FINCA in Uganda 11 years ago and she—when she started she had 10 children. Her husband was beating her, she was on 80-cents a day and she was—she was telling us how she would borrow dirty laundry water from her neighbors to—to clean her clothes because—and her children’s clothes because she couldn’t even afford a little bit of soap. Now 11 years later, she’s opened up a restaurant. Her loans are up to $2,000 now because she’s been such a--you know reliable client. She hired seven other women. She sends all of her daughters to school. One of them is in University now; they like all pooled their money together to—to send the smartest one to University and it’s just amazing the—the amount of responsibility and pride that these women who have no education and virtually no hope can take with themselves with just a little bit of input.""[31]"
Food Allergy Initiative	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Allergy_Initiative	"The Food Allergy Initiative (FAI) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 1998 with the mission to fund food allergy research that seeks a cure, to improve diagnosis and treatment, and to keep patients safe through advocacy and education.  FAI is the largest private source of funding for food allergy research in the United States.  As of 2011, the organization has raised more than $72 million[1] towards these goals.  FAI consistently receives a four-star rating—the highest available—from Charity Navigator, the largest independent charity evaluator in the United States.
 While working within the guidelines set forth by the National Institutes of Health in the Report of the NIH Expert Panel on Food Allergy Research,[2] FAI works to increase:
 FAI sponsors food allergy research across the United States at institutions such as Harvard Medical School, the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and Mount Sinai School of Medicine of New York University.
 FAI played a key role in passing the Food Allergen Labeling & Consumer Protection Act of 2004[3]
 By working with the media, health care workers, camps, restaurants, food manufacturers, and education and childcare professionals, FAI tries to increase awareness of food allergies and anaphylaxis.  Some of the prominent restaurateurs (and restaurants) that have worked with FAI include:"
Food Not Bombs	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Not_Bombs	"Food Not Bombs is a loose-knit group of independent collectives, sharing free vegan and vegetarian food with others. Food Not Bombs' ideology is that myriad corporate and government priorities are skewed to allow hunger to persist in the midst of abundance. To demonstrate this (and to reduce costs), a large amount of the food served by the group is surplus food from grocery stores, bakeries and markets that would otherwise go to waste (or, occasionally, has already been thrown away). This group exhibits a form of franchise activism.
 Food Not Bombs is an all-volunteer global movement that shares free vegan meals as a protest to war and poverty. Each chapter collects surplus food that would otherwise go to waste from grocery stores, bakeries and markets (and occasionally from garbage dumpsters when stores are uncooperative [1]), as well as donations from local farmers, then prepares community meals which are served for free to anyone who is hungry. The central beliefs of the group are:[2]
 Food Not Bombs works to call attention to poverty and homelessness in society by sharing food in public, physically accessible places[4] and facilitating community gatherings of hungry people.
 Anyone who wants to cook may cook, and anyone who wants to eat may eat. Food Not Bombs strives to include everyone.[5]
 Food Not Bombs was founded in 1980 in Cambridge, Massachusetts by anti-nuclear activists Keith McHenry,[6] Jo Swanson, Mira Brown, Susan Eaton, Brian Feigenbaum, C.T. Lawrence Butler,[7] Jessie Constable and Amy Rothstien. Co-founder, Keith McHenry has volunteered for 35 years and can be found sharing food almost every week in various cities including Santa Cruz, California and Taos, New Mexico. The members' activities included providing food, marching, and protesting. Their protests were against such things as nuclear power, United States' involvement in the Salvadoran Civil War, and discrimination against the homeless.[8]
 The first arrests for sharing free food were on August 15, 1988 at the entrance to Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California. Nine people were arrested that day, including McHenry. The city went on to make over 1,000 arrests, and Amnesty International declared these volunteers 'prisoners of conscience'.[9]
 Food Not Bombs grew throughout the 1990s, and held four international gatherings: in San Francisco in 1992 and in 1995, in Atlanta in 1996, and in Philadelphia in 2005. The 1995 International Food Not Bombs Gathering took place in and around United Nations Plaza in San Francisco at the same time the world was celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations (at a historic conference in San Francisco).
 Chapters of Food Not Bombs were involved in the rise of the Anti-Globalization Movement in the late 1990s, leading to the APEC resistance in Vancouver in 1997; the June 18, 1999, International Carnival Against Capitalism; and the so-called ""Battle of Seattle"" later that year, which shut down the World Trade Organization meetings. Food Not Bombs helped start the Low Watt FM Free Radio, the October 22nd No Police Brutality Day, and Homes Not Jails during the San Francisco days.
 Food Not Bombs supported the actions against the Iraq War by providing meals at protests all over the world.  During a presentation to the University of Texas at Austin in 2006, an FBI counter-terrorism official labeled Food Not Bombs and Indymedia as having possible terrorist connections.[10][11]
 In the summer of 2007, the Fort Lauderdale Food Not Bombs chapter began to receive systematic harassment by local law enforcement until an ultimatum made by the Fort Lauderdale Police for the arrest of those conducting the feedings was met with hundreds of supporters the next week and subsequent relenting by local law enforcement until the 2010s.[12]
 Orlando enacted an ordinance prohibiting serving food to more than a certain number of people without a permit.[13] In the fall of 2007, Eric Montanez of Orlando's Food Not Bombs was charged with violating a city ordinance by feeding more people in a public park at one time than the law allows without a permit. On October 10, 2007, Montanez was acquitted by a jury.[14][15]  Food Not Bombs and a church for the homeless called First Vagabonds Church of God sued the city[13] on the grounds that serving food is first amendment-protected political speech and religious activity. The groups won and the city ordinance was overturned; Orlando appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and won.[13]  On August 31, 2010, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the decision, barring Orlando from enforcing the ordinance until another hearing before a 10-judge panel takes place.[13]
 In May 2008, local business owners attempted to stop the Kitchener, Ontario, Food Not Bombs from serving in a highly visible downtown location,[16][full citation needed] describing the group as supporting meat-free diets, anti-capitalism, and an end to Canada's military intervention in Afghanistan.[17][full citation needed]
 In April 2009, the city of Middletown, Connecticut, issued a cease-and-desist order to the local chapter of Food Not Bombs. Prior to the order, the City Health Inspector had cited the organization for distributing food without a license. In August 2009 the chapter began operating out of a licensed kitchen provided by the Middletown First Church of Christ Congregational as state hearings into the matter were held.[18]
 As of October 2011, there were more than 400 chapters of Food Not Bombs listed on the organization's website,[19] with about half the chapters located outside the United States. Food Not Bombs has a loose structure: every chapter of Food Not Bombs embraces a few basic principles, and carries out the same sort of action, but every chapter is free to make its own decisions, based on the needs of its community. Likewise, every chapter of Food Not Bombs operates on consensus. Besides collecting and distributing food for free, many chapters of Food Not Bombs are involved in community anti-poverty, anti-war, and pro-immigrant organizing, as well as other political causes related to social justice.
 The most widely publicized restrictions on food sharing involving Food Not Bombs were the 2011 feeding bans in Florida.  Similar laws have been enacted in other jurisdictions, including Philadelphia[20] and Houston.[21]
 On April 20, 2011, an en banc panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Orlando ordinance as a valid ""time, place and manner"" regulation,[22] reversing the initial ruling of First Vagabonds Church of God, An Unincorporated Association, Brian Nichols v. City of Orlando, Florida and removing the permanent injunction against the Orlando ordinance that was first attempted in 2007.[23]
 On May 18[24] the 30-day stay ended and the ordinance would soon be enforced on June 1 resulting in the arrest of co-founder Keith McHenry and Orlando FNB volunteer Ben Markeson. Each successive sharing saw arrests, with four arrests on June 6, five on June 8, three on June 13, and six on June 21. That same week the lawyer for Orlando FNB issued a cease and desist to the city,[25] saying that violating the ordinance was not an arrestable offense, and hackers claiming to be affiliated with Anonymous began issuing threats to the city of Orlando. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer has also received heavy criticism for referring to Food Not Bombs activists as ""food terrorists.""[26][27][28]
 On Monday, June 20, no arrests were made at Food Not Bombs' breakfast in Lake Eola Park, however Ben Markeson was cited for holding a sign without a permit, with much confusion among city officials about procedure and the violations of civil rights. The city later issued a statement reversing their interpretation of the sign regulations. On the same day hackers carried through with their threats and took down the Orlando Chamber of Commerce site and a Universal Studios website in ""Operation Orlando,"" issuing a video statement later declaring a 48-hour cease fire on the condition that the city arrest no one for feeding the homeless, presumably on June 22.[29][30]
 On June 22 more arrests took place including a second arrest of McHenry, resulting in a 17-day stay in jail. ""Operation Orlando"" soon went into full attack resulting in many websites going down in subsequent days. Orlando and Dyer were soon inundated with national and international attention and outcry. On July 1, OFNB took the Mayor up on his offer to move sharings to City Hall, which stopped arrests and resulted in a new, stable arrangement for OFNB.[31][32]
 Homeless hacktivist Christopher Doyon, also known as ""Commander X"", was eventually arrested for ""Operation Orlando"" and other activity. Soon after his arraignment he held a press statement where he admitted to all charges, but argued that the distributed denial of service attacks constituted acts of cyber-civil disobedience.[33][34]
 Fort Lauderdale has been pondering a feeding ban for some time. In 2011 FNB activists complained  about unjust surveillance and arrest and claimed to be victims of an unwarranted police raid due to their home having their electricity cut off; they were harassed by police asking if they were ""terrorists."" Activists have also been arrested while playing a game of capture the flag.[35]
 Pinellas County is not only trying to ban feeding but is also banning sleeping in public. This means that homeless people in the St Pete area must either move into the ""Safe Harbor"" homeless facility or get out of the town.[36]
 An ordinance in Sarasota currently requires gatherings of 75 or more people to obtain a special event permit. Local residents are currently petitioning to lower that number to 12, as well as to require feeders to obtain the same permit necessary for people who sell goods in public places (a $150 fee). There have been numerous other ordinances in recent months targeting the homeless, including the banning of smoking and removing park benches.[37][38] Since 2009, homeless shelters in Gainesville could feed only 130 people at a time, leading to the formation of the Coalition To End The Meal Limit.[39] Two years later, the meal limit and other rules were significantly changed, resulting in a victory for the Coalition to End The Meal Limit.[40]
 On August 19, 2011, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer held a press conference to announce that charges against food sharers arrested in Lake Eola Park, Orlando, were dropped, resulting in a new state of compromise between Buddy Dyer's administration and Orlando Food Not Bombs.[41]
 In November 2014, Fort Lauderdale finally enacted a sharing ban, drawing a similar flurry of media attention as in Orlando.[42] Several Food Not Bombs activists were arrested sharing food and other acts of civil disobedience, for which they received ""Civil Liberties Arrest"" medals from the Broward County ACLU.[43][44][45] Other FNB activists went on hunger strike against enforcement of the law.[46] A court injunction stopped enforcement of the sharing ban in early December 2014 pending several court cases. In late December the injunction was extended until February.[47]  On January 29, 2015, Food Not Bombs filed a 29-page federal lawsuit against the City of Fort Lauderdale to strike down the sharing ban ordinances as unconstitutional.[48] On August 22, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled that outdoor food sharing by Food Not Bombs was protected under the First Amendment.[49] The case was sent back to the lower court to determine whether the 2014 sharing ban was unconstitutionally vague. 
 Food Not Bombs groups have been heavily involved in supporting occupation camps across the US during the Occupy Wall Street movement. The use of consensus, supporting urban homeless communities, and mass feedings through donations are all specialties of Food Not Bombs that has now seen an unheralded demand.[50]
 In a case of history repeating itself, a Food Not Bombs kitchen was removed in a late night police confrontation with Occupy San Francisco in mid-October.[51]
 Co-founder C.T. Lawrence Butler came back to the Boston activism scene to join Occupy Boston.[52]
 Co-founder Keith McHenry, who spent much of the year encouraging the advent of American occupation camps during his touring, has been an enthusiastic participant in many camps[53] even as he has released a new Food Not Bombs handbook.[54]
 A Food Not Bombs World Gathering took place August 20–26, 2012, in Tampa, Florida - the week before the Republican National Convention.[55] In conjunction with Occupy Tampa and many other organizations, Food Not Bombs activists collected and prepared food for hundreds of RNC protesters and offered workshops, cultural events, and protest activities from August 20–30.[56]
 Near the end of 2012, Food Not Bombs activists, in particular, Long Island Food Not Bombs, fed countless thousands of people in the wake of Superstorm Sandy alongside ""Occupy Sandy."" [57] The outpouring of food going to waste and support for disaster-stricken, impoverished communities culminated in the ""Largest Food Not Bombs Ever"" at the ""Hempstead Food Share Bonanza"" on Nov. 18th.[58]
 Keith McHenry and other long-time Food Not Bombs activists announced in 2012 the opening of the FNB Free Skool in Taos, New Mexico. The first year of classes started in summer of 2013.  Topics covered by the course are an analysis of current social issues, community organizing, nonviolent social change, cultural events which support social change and sustainable future for communities.[59]
 Food not Bombs has established itself as one of the most rapidly developing social movements against containment politics.[60] The growth in social development from Food Not Bombs was apparent through the 1980s. As more and more cuts were being drawn from social welfare programs and attacks on the labor force deepened, Food Not Bombs developed a revolutionary intent.[61] In the words of two Food Not Bombs organizers, they explained, ""unable to address the real causes of social and economic inequality, business leaders and politicians increasingly felt that if the homeless can be permanently contained within the homeless shelters and rehabilitation programs, then the economic problems of retail businesses and the tourist industry will be miraculously solved.""[61] Serving their food was a public struggle against such ruling classes.[citation needed] By recycling food, Food Not Bombs brought food back to their original use-value, which in turn, ruined their exchange-value. Through their stance of minimizing environmental impacts, they hope to reduce the wasteful tendencies of capitalist production. 
 Food Not Bombs operates under the assumption that a lack of food quality in the neoliberalism era has led to large populations of malnutrition and undernutrition.[62] Despite available government assistance, there is a large percentage of Americans who are unable to effectively feed their families. This lack of support is connected a larger neoliberal and racialized system that prohibits the accurate distribution of food production by limiting access to public transportation and grocery stores, creating a heavy reliance on market mechanisms to feed people.[62] As problems with undernutrition grow, so do the levels of malnutrition. More unhealthy foods at a more affordable price has created a large diet deficiency. The trends of these increasing health concerns are tied to the capitalist political economy of food production, by producing cheap food despite the environment and health ramifications.[62] The importance of food sovereignty has been established to challenge the neoliberal centered lifestyle. This idea would give the people the right to have healthy and well grown food through sustainable methods. Due to the focus on individual and community autonomy, the idea of food sovereignty is thought to risk US marginalization.[63] Through class solidarity, an organizational outcry was formed, leading to the challenging of national and global institutions. Operating at a plurality of political and social scales, grassroots were established and a local resistance was built. Food Not Bombs participants feeding themselves is resistance against food insecurity and also considered citizenship.[64] ""One of Food Not Bombs long-term goals is to help communities see what they can do in terms of increasing food self-sufficiency and security"".[65] Through the use of donated, community and locally grown food, Food Not Bombs attempts to prove that a sustainable and healthy diet for low income families who cannot always afford to eat a nutritious meal is possible by giving the tools to do so to the community. Food Not Bombs attempts to demonstrate the self-sufficient capacity among the poor through preparation of a variety of free and healthy dishes.[66]
 The large public concern of mass consumerism and awareness of food models and practices put a pressure on civil society groups. By forming links between food practices and social movements, a framework was built. With this new, active role of civil society, as is seen with Food Not Bombs, comes new policy initiatives. Many civil societies had felt that the developing institutional frameworks failed in their ability to provide and support the community. Some authors considered that growing interest from certain local institutions was needed as a supportive expression of a neo-liberal model of potential urban development.[67] However, the building dissatisfaction with the ability and work of legal institutions and of consumerism provoked large opposition.
 Food Not Bombs holds similar ideological values as anarchists. Many anarchists criticize modern-day consumerism and believe there are alternative options in the development in consumption, production, and culture.[68] Anarchists attempt to build a lifestyle that focuses on less purchasing and more re-using. Since Food Not Bombs has several chapters, it is difficult to place the group's specific action. However, it is certain that the Food Not Bombs group does agree with the anarchist social theory and is part of a larger Anarchist political action group.[69] Anarchist ""freegans"" use dumpster diving to oppose capitalist ideas. Many of these divers believe that the mass consumerism produces too much waste, leading to a misuse of natural resources and lack of social understanding. According to freegans, this lack of preservation allows the continuation of mass redistribution of income between the poor and working class to give their wages to much more powerful corporations.[70] Focusing on the consequences of consumerism, they build the idea of ""freeganism"" by participating in a ""no-sumption"", or the avoidance of direct consumption.[67] Just as the freegans had done, the Food Not Bombs members use their platform to go against the ""throwaway"" accessibility of the modern era of mass disposable consumerism. Participating in the practice known as dumpster diving, the group hopes to give waste utility and to help provide the poor with rich excesses. By bringing a voluntary association together to provide an alternative to the modern waste system, Food Not Bombs has moved against neoliberal urban development models. On a social level, the group is able to challenge the land by politicizing public spaces around the issue of inequality and hunger.[62]"
Ford Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Foundation	"The Ford Foundation is an American  private foundation with the mission of advancing human welfare.[2][3][4][5] Created in 1936[6] by Edsel Ford and Henry Ford, it was originally funded by a US$25,000 gift from Edsel Ford.[3] By 1947, after the death of the two founders, the foundation owned 90% of the non-voting shares of the Ford Motor Company. (The Ford family retained the voting shares.[7]) Between 1955 and 1974, the foundation sold its Ford Motor Company holdings and now plays no role in the automobile company. Ahead of the foundation selling its Ford Motor Company holdings, in 1949 Henry Ford II created the Ford Motor Company Fund,[8] a separate corporate foundation which to this day serves as the philanthropic arm of the Ford Motor Company and is not associated with the foundation.[9] For years it was the largest, and one of the most influential foundations in the world, with global reach and special interests in economic empowerment, education, human rights, democracy, the creative arts, and Third World development.
 The foundation makes grants through its headquarters and ten international field offices.[10] For fiscal year 2014, it reported assets of US$12.4 billion and approved US$507.9 million in grants.[1][11]
 After its establishment in 1936, Ford Foundation shifted its focus from Michigan philanthropic support to four areas of action.  In the 1950 Report of the Study of the Ford Foundation on Policy and Program, the trustees set forth five ""areas of action,"" according to Richard Magat (2012): economic improvements, education, freedom and democracy, human behaviour, and world peace.[12]
 Since the middle of the 20th century, many of the Ford Foundation's programs have focused on increased under-represented or ""minority"" group representation in education, science and policy-making. For over eight decades their mission decisively advocates and supports the reduction of poverty and injustice among other values including the maintenance of democratic values, promoting engagement with other nations, and sustaining human progress and achievement at home and abroad.[12]
 The Ford Foundation is one of the primary foundations offering grants that support and maintain diversity in higher education with fellowships for pre-doctoral, dissertation, and post-doctoral scholarship to increase diverse representation among Native Americans, African Americans, Latinos/Latinas and other under-represented Asian and Latino sub-groups throughout the U.S. academic labor market.[13][14] The outcomes of scholarship by its grantees from the late 20th century through the 21st century have contributed to substantial data and scholarship including national surveys such as the Nelson Diversity Surveys in STEM. [15][16][17][18]
 The foundation was established January 15, 1936,[3] in Michigan by Edsel Ford (president of the Ford Motor Company) and two other executives ""to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare."" [19] During its early years, the foundation operated in Michigan under the leadership of Ford family members and their associates and supported the Henry Ford Hospital and the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, among other organizations.
 After the deaths of Edsel Ford in 1943 and Henry Ford in 1947, the presidency of the foundation fell to Edsel's eldest son, Henry Ford II. It quickly became clear that the foundation would become the largest philanthropic organisation in the world. The board of trustees then commissioned the Gaither Study Committee to chart the foundation's future. The committee, headed by California attorney H. Rowan Gaither, recommended that the foundation become an international philanthropic organisation dedicated to the advancement of human welfare and ""urged the foundation to focus on solving humankind's most pressing problems, whatever they might be, rather than work in any particular field...."" The board embraced the recommendations in 1949.[3]
 The board of directors decided to diversify the foundation's portfolio and gradually divested itself of its substantial Ford Motor Company stock between 1955 and 1974.[3]  This divestiture allowed Ford Motor to become a public company. Finally, Henry Ford II resigned from his trustee's role in a surprise move in December 1976. In his resignation letter, he cited his dissatisfaction with the foundation holding on to their old programs, large staff and what he saw as anti-capitalist undertones in the foundation's work.[20][21] In February 2019, Henry Ford III was elected to the Foundation's Board of Trustees, becoming the first Ford family member to serve on the board since his grandfather resigned in 1976.[22][23]
 In 2012, stating that it is not a research library, the foundation transferred its archives from New York City to the Rockefeller Archive Center in Sleepy Hollow, New York.[24]
 Based on recommendations made by the Gaither Study Committee and embraced by the foundation's board of trustees in 1949, the foundation expanded its grant making to include support for higher education, the arts, economic development, civil rights, and the environment, among other areas.
 In 1951, the foundation made its first grant to support the development of the public broadcasting system, then known as National Educational Television (NET), which went on the air in 1952.[25] These grants continued, and in 1969 the foundation gave US$1 million to the Children's Television Workshop to help create and launch Sesame Street.[26] The Corporation for Public Broadcasting replaced NET with the Public Broadcasting Service on October 5, 1970.[27]
 The foundation underwrote the Fund for the Republic in the 1950s.
 The foundation's first international field office opened in 1952 in New Delhi, India.
 Throughout the 1950s, the foundation provided arts and humanities fellowships that supported the work of figures like Josef Albers, James Baldwin, Saul Bellow, Herbert Blau, E. E. Cummings, Anthony Hecht, Flannery O'Connor, Jacob Lawrence, Maurice Valency, Robert Lowell, and Margaret Mead. In 1961, Kofi Annan received an educational grant from the foundation to finish his studies at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota.[28]
 Under its ""Program for Playwrights"", the foundation helped to support writers in professional regional theaters such as San Francisco's Actor's Workshop and offered similar help to  Houston's Alley Theatre and Washington's Arena Stage.[29]
 In 1968, the foundation began disbursing $12 million to persuade law schools to make ""law school clinics"" part of their curriculum.  Clinics were intended to give practical experience in law practice while providing pro bono representation to the poor. Conservative critic Heather Mac Donald contends that the financial involvement of the foundation instead changed the clinics' focus from giving students practical experience to engaging in leftwing advocacy.[30]
 In 1967 and 1968, the foundation provided financial support for decentralization and community control of public schools in New York City. Decentralization in Ocean Hill–Brownsville led to the firing of some white teachers and administrators, which provoked a citywide teachers' strike led by the United Federation of Teachers.[31]
 Beginning in the late 1960s and continuing through the 1970s, the foundation expanded into civil rights litigation, granting $18 million to civil rights litigation groups.[32] The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund was incorporated in 1967 with a US$2.2 million grant from the foundation.[32] In the same year, the foundation funded the establishment of the Southwest Council of La Raza, the predecessor of the National Council of La Raza.[33] In 1972, the foundation provided a three-year US$1.2 million grant to the Native American Rights Fund.[32] The same year, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund opened with funding from numerous organizations, including the foundation.[32][34] In 1974, the foundation contributed funds to the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project[35] and the Latino Institute.[citation needed]
 In 1976, the foundation helped launch the Grameen Bank, which offers small loans to the rural poor of Bangladesh. The Grameen Bank and its founder Muhammad Yunus were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering micro-credit.[36]
 Between 1969 and 1978, the foundation was the biggest funder for research into In vitro fertilisation in the United Kingdom, which led to the first baby, Louise Brown born from the technique. The Ford Foundation provided $1,170,194 towards the research.[37]
 In 1987, the foundation began making grants to fight the AIDS epidemic[38] and in 2010 made grant disbursements totalling US$29,512,312.[39]
 Over two decades ago, American author, conservative philosopher, and critic of feminism Christina Hoff Sommers,  pointed a finger at The Ford Foundation in her book The War Against Boys (1994) as well as other institutions in education and government.[40] While she alleged that the Ford Foundation funded a gender feminism or mainstream feminist ideology that supports her thesis, a Washington Post book review by E. Anthony Rotundo, author of ""American Manhood: Transformations in Masculinity from the Revolution to the Modern Era,"" exposed how Sommers ""persistently misrepresents scholarly debate, [and] ignores evidence that contradicts her assertions"" about a gender war against boys and men.[41] Spanish judge Francisco Serrano Castro [es] made similar claims in his 2012 book The Dictatorship of Gender.[42] Such conservative claims imply The Ford Foundation is a funding agency supporting a liberal agenda.
 In 2001, the foundation launched the International Fellowships Program (IFP) with a 12-year, $280 million grant, the largest in its history. IFP is entering its concluding phase. The final cohort has been selected, and the program will conclude in 2013. Fellows represent historically disadvantaged groups from outside the United States. IFP has identified nearly 4,350 emerging leaders. More than 80 percent have completed their studies and are now serving their home communities.[43]
 In 2003, the foundation was critiqued by US news service Jewish Telegraphic Agency, among others, for supporting Palestinian nongovernmental organizations that were accused of promoting antisemitism at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism. Under pressure by several members of Congress, chief among them Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the foundation apologized and then prohibited the promotion of ""violence, terrorism, bigotry or the destruction of any state"" among its grantees. This move itself sparked protest among university provosts and various non-profit groups on free speech issues.[44]
 The foundation's partnership with the New Israel Fund, which began in 2003, was frequently criticized regarding its choice of mostly liberal grantees and causes. This criticism came to light after the 2001 Durban Conference, where some nongovernmental organizations funded by the foundation backed resolutions equating Israeli policies as apartheid, and later, against those groups which support the delegitimization of Israel. In response, the foundation adopted stricter criteria for funding.[45]
 In 2005, Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox began a probe of the foundation. Though the foundation is headquartered in New York City, it is chartered in Michigan, giving that state some jurisdiction. Cox focused on its governance, potential conflicts of interest among board members, and what he viewed as its poor record of giving to charities in Michigan. Between 1998 and 2002, the foundation gave Michigan charities about US$2.5 million per year, far less than many other charities its size. The foundation countered that an extensive review and report by the Gaither Study Committee in 1949 had recommended that the foundation broaden its scope beyond Michigan to national and international grant-making. The report was endorsed by the foundation's board of trustees, and they subsequently voted to move the foundation to New York City in 1953.[3][46][47]
 For many years, the foundation topped annual lists compiled by the Foundation Center of US foundations with the most assets and the highest annual giving. The foundation has fallen a few places in those lists in recent years, especially with the establishment of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000. As of May 4, 2013, the foundation was second in terms of assets[1] and tenth in terms of annual grant giving.[48]
 In April 2011, the foundation announced that it will cease its funding for programs in Israel as of 2013. It has provided US$40 million to nongovernmental organizations in Israel since 2003 exclusively through the New Israel Fund (NIF), in the areas of advancing civil and human rights, helping Arab citizens in Israel gain equality and promoting Israeli-Palestinian peace. The grants from the foundation are roughly a third of NIF's donor-advised giving, which totals about US$15 million a year.[45]
 The foundation was accused of being funded by the US government.[49][50] John J. McCloy, the foundation's chairman from 1958–1965, knowingly employed numerous agents and, based on the premise that a relationship with the CIA was inevitable, set up a three-person committee responsible for dealing with its requests.[51][52]
 Ranked No. 24 on the Forbes 2018 World’s Most Innovative Companies list, the Ford Foundation utilized its endowment to invest in innovative and sustainable change leadership shifting the model of grant-making in the 21st century. According to Forbes, ""Ford spends between $500 million and $550 million a year to support social justice work around the world. But last year, it also pledged to plow up to $1 billion of its overall $12.5 billion endowment over the next decade into so-called mission-related investments (MRIs) that generate both financial and social returns.""[53][54] With assets totaling $12,364,759,000 and total giving amounting to $526,405,000 in 2018, President Darren Walker has led the organization with a new purpose. He wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times that that grant-making philanthropy of institutions like the Ford Foundation ""must not only be generosity, but justice."" [55] The Ford Foundation seeks to address ""the underlying causes that perpetuate human suffering"" to grapple with and intervene in ""how and why"" inequality persists.[55]
 Completed in 1968 by the firm of Roche-Dinkeloo, the Ford Foundation Building in New York City was the first large-scale architectural building in the country to devote a substantial portion of its space to horticultural pursuits. Its well-known atrium was designed with the notion of having urban greenspace accessible to all and is an example of the application in architecture of environmental psychology. The building was recognized in 1968 by the Architectural Record as ""a new kind of urban space"". This design concept was used by others for many of the indoor shopping malls and skyscrapers built in subsequent decades. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building a landmark in the mid-1990s.

The Foundation for a Better Life	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foundation_for_a_Better_Life	"The Foundation for a Better Life is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization founded in 2000 to ""promote good values"".[1] The foundation creates public service campaigns to share with others its values, including honesty, caring, and optimism, in order to create a better social paradigm. The foundation communicates its message through television, outdoor advertising, theatre, radio, and the Internet and is best known for the ""Pass It On"" campaign in which viewers are encouraged to live by and pass on certain values, with the rationale that examples of individuals living values-based lives may not change the world, but collectively they make a difference.
 Founded in 2000, it is headed by its president, Gary Dixon. The organization launched its first campaign on November 9, 2001. The original start date was September 13, 2001, but it was postponed due to the September 11 attacks. The initial campaign appeared on about 10,000 billboards, signs and posters nationwide.[2] The original message of the campaign was modified to include themes which recognized the state of the nation following the attacks. Specifically, the values of ""unity"" and ""courage"" were added with images of flags and firefighters.[2] The campaign was created by copywriter Jay Schulberg  and art director Bernie Hogya.[citation needed]
 Prior to the launch of the campaign, Dixon contacted Nancy Fletcher, president and chief executive at the Outdoor Advertising Association of America in Washington. He reportedly was inspired by the association's billboard campaign called God Speaks, which generated enormous attention in 1999 and 2000.[2]
 The foundation continues to sponsor public service messages in various media. The foundation's ""Pass It On"" campaign has incorporated the likenesses of Wayne Gretzky, Michelle Kwan, Oprah Winfrey, Nelson Mandela, Michael J. Fox, Albert Einstein and Muhammad Ali.[3]
 The Foundation neither solicits nor accepts monetary donations from the public. It is not officially affiliated with any religion, instead hoping that ""the values we share transcend any particular religion or nationality"". The chief contributor of the foundation also serves as the chief contributor of the Random Acts of Kindness Foundation.[4]  All funding comes from the Anschutz Family Foundation. [5]"
Foundation for Child Development	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Child_Development	"The Foundation for Child Development is a United States-based non-profit organization which promotes good child development.
 The organization began as a volunteer community project in 1899, then in 1908 was established as the Association for the Aid of Crippled Children.[2] The goal of the organization then was to support disabled children.[3] In 1972 the organization changed its name to the Foundation for Child Development.[2]"
The Fred Hollows Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fred_Hollows_Foundation	"The Fred Hollows Foundation is a non-profit aid organization based in Australia and founded in 1992 by eye surgeon Fred Hollows. The Foundation focuses on treating and preventing blindness and other vision problems. It operates in Australia, The Pacific, South and South East Asia, and Africa.
 The Fred Hollows Foundation was founded on 3 September 1992, by Fred Hollows shortly before he died. Hollows was an eye doctor (ophthalmologist), a skilled surgeon and a social justice activist. Hollows was committed to improving the health of Indigenous Australians and to reducing the cost of eye health care and treatment in developing countries. He had already started project work in Eritrea, Nepal, Vietnam and Indigenous Australia. His work in Vietnam was only in the early stages when he died.  However, his widow, Gabi Hollows, followed through on the commitment that she had made to her late husband and ensured that his work in Vietnam (and others countries) continued through the Foundation.[2]
 The Foundation works to achieve four key goals:[2]
 They 
 
 The Fred Hollows Foundation has blindness prevention programs operating in over 19 countries throughout Africa, South Asia and South East Asia, including countries such as Vietnam and Nepal.[3]
 The Foundation also works to provide a full range of eye health services including eye health promotion, screening, prevention, curative treatment and rehabilitation.
 In Africa, The Foundation focuses on comprehensive eye health systems with an emphasis on the training of medical staff, screening for poor vision and eye disease, subsidised treatment and provision of equipment and infrastructure in countries such as Eritrea, Kenya,[4] Rwanda, South Africa and Tanzania.
 The Foundation works throughout Asia in countries such as East Timor,[5] Afghanistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Cambodia, China, Laos, North Korea, and Vietnam to build comprehensive eye care systems at village, district, provincial and national levels.
 The Fred Hollows Foundation works in many Indigenous communities throughout Australia, including the Jawoyn community of the Northern Territory. In the Jawoyn community the work of the foundation does not focus exclusively on eye health, but also includes literacy and nutrition work for the community.[6]
 In February 2008, the Foundation committed up to A$3 million to build an eye clinic in Alice Springs, Australia.[7] By April 2010, this clinic had not been built with criticism that the Australian Government were relying on a charity to build the clinic. The Minister for Indigenous Health, Warren Snowdon, said the foundation was best placed to provide the eye clinic service.[8]
 The Foundation is a member of the Australian Council for International Development (ACFID), and is also a signatory to the ACFID code of conduct that ""defines standards of governance, management, financial control and reporting with which non government development organisations (NGDOs) should comply.""[9][10]
 Australia's overseas aid agency, AusAID, has accredited The Fred Hollows Foundation, and as such The Foundation is eligible to receive funding from the Australian Government for overseas aid programs. According to AusAID ""the accreditation process aims to provide AusAID, and the Australian public, with confidence that the Australian Government is funding professional, well-managed, community-based organisations that are capable of delivering quality development outcomes.""[11]
 Over the years, The Foundation has been supported by a number of high-profile celebrities and athletes, including:
 In late 2009, it was claimed that in the previous year the Foundation lost more than $2 million with the investment bank Goldman Sachs JBWere. A former member of the organisation's British board, Nick Crane, said the losses were evidence of a new entrepreneurial zeal in the Australian head office, and that the foundation was at risk of losing sight of its true purpose because newer members of the Australian management team had backgrounds in business rather than charity.[25] The Foundation denied these claims, and responded that the $2 million loss was incorrect and that The Foundation had lost $270,000 from investments but had actually gained $350,000 income. However, the value of the Foundation's investments had been written down by $1.6 million by end of 2008.[26][27] After a letter from Gabi Hollows to the editor of the Sydney Morning Herald,[28] the article was corrected.[29] The Fred Hollows Foundation in New Zealand had also lost no money in their investments in New Zealand.[30]"
Fremont Area Community Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Area_Community_Foundation	"The Fremont Area Community Foundation is a philanthropic organization in Fremont, Michigan. Founded in 1972 to serve the people of Newaygo County, it is one of the largest community foundations in the United States on a per capita basis, serving a population of 50,000 with net assets of approximately $218 million. The foundation is composed of more than 400 separate funds, including two supporting organizations and three geographic affiliates.[1]
 In 1972, the foundation was established with $10 million in assets, combining the funds of the private Fremont Foundation with other charitable funds such as Harry Williams, Frank Daniel Gerber, Dan & Dorothy Gerber, Marion & Charles Gerber, Gussie Gerber, Earle Johnson and William & Colleen Mee.
 Between 1972 and 1994, the foundation grew its assets from $10 million to $65 million, granting approximately $2.5 million annually. In August 1994, the sale of the Gerber Products Company to Sandoz (now Novartis), of Switzerland, nearly doubled the assets of the foundation, which at the time owned 1.8 million shares of stock, bringing its total assets to $109 million overnight. From 1994 through the end of the century, the Foundation continued to grow, reaching almost $200 million in assets. Grant awards total approximately $10 million each year.[2]
 Since 1972, the Foundation has received $56 million in gifts and made $146 million in grants to benefit the Newaygo County area, a 261% return on donors’ dollars. In 2008, the Foundation made grants of $10.6 million.[1]
 The Fremont Community Foundation is under the direction of CEO Carla Roberts, COO Gregory Zerlaut, as well as 15 other trustees.
 The foundation has sponsored many community related programs and events, including the Newaygo County Hunger Initiative, a program that in 2008 distributed 1.65 million pounds of food to low income residents in Newaygo County,[3] the West Michigan Student Showcase, a regional talent show for several hundred area high school students,[4] and in support of tax breaks to the Gerber Products Company, the foundation approved a grant to the City of Fremont to cover lost tax revenues of $525,000 in order to help retain the county's largest employer, as well as ensure the financial health of the city.[5]
 The foundation has also support many building programs in Newaygo County, such as the construction of Gerber Memorial's $8.3 million Tamarac Center, which will further improve the health and wellness of area residents.[6]
 The Youth Advisory Committee (YAC) advises the Board of Directors on grants and issues regarding area youth. YAC members are selected from all Newaygo County High Schools and in 2008 the total Youth Endowment Fund grants were $81,884.[7]
 The Amazing X Charitable Trust Board advises the Board of Directors on grants that are to benefit people in Newaygo County with disabilities. In 2008 the total Amazing X Charitable Trust grants were $301,379.[7]
 The Elderly Needs Fund Board provides grants to benefit the elderly in Newaygo County. In 2008 the total Elderly Needs Fund grants were $493,630.[7]
 The Fremont Area Community Foundation's Speaker Series often invites people to come and speak on various issues and subjects. These events are open to the public, free of charge, and are usually held at the Dogwood Center for the Performing Arts or larger events are held at the Grant Fine Arts Center. 
 In 2008, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spoke to more than 700 people at Grant on several environmental and energy related issues.[8]

Friedrich Ebert Stiftung	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Ebert_Foundation	"The Friedrich Ebert Foundation (German: Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung; Abbreviation: FES) is a German political foundation associated with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), yet independent of it. Established in 1925 as the political legacy of Friedrich Ebert, Germany's first democratically elected President, it is the largest and oldest of the German party-associated foundations. It is headquartered in Bonn and Berlin, and has offices and projects in over 100 countries. It is Germany's oldest organisation to promote democracy, political education, and promote students of outstanding intellectual abilities and personality.
 The FES was named for Friedrich Ebert (1871–1925), the Social Democratic President of Germany, 1919-1925. In his will, he specified that the proceeds from donations at his funeral should be used to create a foundation.  The SPD chairman at the time, Konrad Ludwig, was given the responsibility of building this foundation, which he did a few days after Ebert's death in 1925.
The main concern of the foundation was to work against discrimination of workers in the area of education:
""The Friedrich Ebert Foundation pursues the goal of giving young, empowered proletarians government aid to fund an education at state-accredited institutions.  As a basic principle, only those people who have a recommendation from the party organisation will receive funding."" (SPD Yearbook 1926)
By the end of 1931, 295 students had been funded with over 52,000 marks.  Unfortunately, at this point the funding of the foundation fell through, as a result of the Great Depression.
The FES was a section of the Social Democratic Education and Culture Organisation, and was banned along with the party itself in 1933 by the Nazis.
In 1946, the FES was reinstituted at the founding assembly of the Socialist German Student Federation. In 1954, the FES was restructured into a charitable organisation ""for the advancement of democratic education"". This established the FES as an independent, self-contained institute.
In addition to education programmes, the FES has also worked in the area of development aid since the 1960s.  In this effort, it has supported democracy and freedom movements, for instance in the African National Congress (ANC), and played an important role in overcoming dictatorial regimes in Greece, Spain, and Portugal.  Thus it was not a coincidence that the Socialist Party of Portugal was formed in an FES school in the German town of Bad Münstereifel.
 The Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Academic Foundation (FES) is one of eleven organizations for the promotion of young talents (Begabtenförderwerke) in Germany. Only 1% of German students achieve a scholarship at one of the eleven organizations (i.e. FES, Studienstiftung, Konrad Adenauer Foundation).[1] It is financially funded and subsidized by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and supports students with outstanding academical and political achievements. Awards are granted after a multi-stage selection process and are based on grades, letters of recommendation, letters of motivation, political and social engagement as well as personality and character. Until today it has sponsored more than 12,000 grantees. Over 90% of those sponsored graduate with honours.  In 2005, there were 1,731 students in the programme, of which 51% were women.  Beyond the financial support, grantees also receive so-called ideational support, which comes from opportunities to attend political seminars, conferences, and other activities, which can be important job qualifications.  The FES kept its own conference center on the Venusberg in Bonn for these activities until its closure in 2009.  Each year, the grantees vote for a board during the nationwide conference at the Stresemann Institute in Bonn.  This board serves for the next full year as the representation of grantees for dialog with the foundation.  The FES maintains a website ([1] www.fes-stip.de) for networking among grantees, which includes a wide variety of mailing lists, services, and communications tools.
 Students are assigned advisors who work with them for the length of their grants, and also belong to a student organisation.
 Today, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation's main goals are to promote political and societal education of people from all walks of life in the spirit of democracy and pluralism, to enable young people the opportunity to study and do research through grants, and to work toward international understanding and cooperation.
 The foundation employs several hundred employees in their offices in Bonn and Berlin, as well as in 14 regional offices and an academy within Germany and in over 100 foreign agencies.  It is financed mainly through grants from the federal budget and the budgets of the various Bundesländer.
 Since 1971, foreign students have also had the opportunity to receive grants through solidarity funds.  Preference for these grants goes to people who are persecuted on political, racial or religious grounds.  Funding for this program comes exclusively from donations from current and former grantees.  The program have helped over 1,000 students.  Currently there are 31 students who are in the solidarity programme. Two grantees from this programme are chosen every year at the conference in Bonn to work on the steering committee of the fund.
 The historical research center of the foundation also contains the Archive of Social Democracy and its libraries in Bonn and at the Karl Marx House in Trier.  This is one of the largest collections of documents on social history and the history of the workers movement.
 Since 1982, the foundation has awarded a prize of 10,000 euro called ""The Political Book"" to promote noteworthy political books. The prize serves to remind people of the Nazi book burnings of May 10, 1933."
Fritt Ord	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritt_Ord_(organization)	"Fritt Ord is a Norwegian private foundation, whose aim is to support freedom of expression and a free press. It was established on 7 June 1974 by Narvesen Kioskkompani's leaders Jens Henrik Nordlie and Finn Skedsmo as well as the lawyer Jens Christian Hauge.
 Fritt Ord has significant funds and is playing a part in supporting various projects in Norway, as investing in the newspaper Morgenbladet, supporting an encyclopedia (Store Norske Leksikon) and holding a 10.1% ownership in the media group A-Pressen. In addition it awards scholarships to students within media and journalism, awards the Fritt Ord Prize, and supports writing competitions. It has also provided funding for controversial projects, e.g. an upcoming book written by the blogger Fjordman,[1] who calls for the deportation of all Muslims from Europe.[2]
 The organization awards three annual prizes to support freedom of speech;[3][4][5] the Fritt Ord Award (Norwegian: Fritt Ords pris), the Fritt Ord Honorary Award (Norwegian: Fritt Ords honnør) and the Press Prizes for Russia and Eastern Europe (Norwegian: Pressepriser for Russland og Øst-Europa). Those prizes not to be confused with ""Ytringsfrihetsprisen"", the annual Freedom of Expression Prize awarded mostly to international writers by the Norwegian Authors' Union.
 The owners of the kiosk chain Narvesen wanted to transform his chain of newspaper and magazine retailers to an institution, and on 1 January 1975 the company was taken over by the newly created foundation Fritt Ord at the same time it merged with the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) company Norsk Spisevognselskap, who offered services within catering to the railway. Fritt Ord got 59% ownership in the newly formed company while NSB got 41% ownership.
 The dividends from the company made it possible for Fritt Ord to perform a number of tasks related to freedom of expression, including support for the Institute of Journalism and the Freedom of Expression Prize as well as a number of grants to numerous persons and institutions, domestically and internationally.
 In 1995 NSB sold its shares in Narvesen and the company was listed on Oslo Stock Exchange. As a result of this Fritt Ord reduced its ownership in Narvesen to 34% in 1999 and in 2000 Narvesen was merged with Reitangruppen to form ReitanNarvesen. In 2001 Fritt Ord sold its ownership in the company to the Reitan Family. As a result of the capital freed from the sale of Narvesen, Fritt Ord has acquired holdings in Morgenbladet (30,5%) and A-Pressen (10,1%).[6]
 The organization was criticized by some for obstructing rather than furthering freedom of speech when it threatened the Norwegian Festival of Literature with withdrawing financial support if the British Holocaust denier David Irving was allowed to speak at the festival.[7] In October 2008 Fritt Ord's director, Erik Rudeng, demanded that its logo be removed from the webpages of the Norwegian Festival of Literature because the controversial historical revisionist David Irving had been invited to give a lecture on his concept of truth at the festival. Irving's invitation was withdrawn only a few days later. Rudeng on his side defended the decision by stating that Fritt Ord only sponsored the literature festival in 2008 and thus it was high time their logo was removed when the program for 2009 was presented.[8] This prompted some commentators to address the paradox of a self-proclaimed ""free speech"" organization which involves itself in a campaign to stop a controversial voice like that of David Irving from being heard in Norway.[7]
 It caused controversy when it became known in 2013 that the organization provided funding to the controversial blogger Fjordman (Peder Jensen), who has been characterised as far-right[9][10] and Islamophobic,[11] for a book Jensen is writing about Anders Breivik and the 2011 Norway attacks.  The Labour youth party leader Eskil Pedersen said that Fritt Ord is an organization that provides a platform for ""gay-haters and racists,"" referring to both the support for Fjordman and previous support for other controversial causes and individuals.[1][12][13] Member of Parliament Snorre Valen accused Fritt Ord of ""mockery of all those killed and injured"" in the 2011 Norway attacks, stating that Fritt Ord provides funding to a writer ""so that he can publish a book about the terrorist he inspired,"" concluding that Fritt Ord supports ""extremism.""[14] Leader of the support group for Breivik's victims, Trond Henry Blattmann, told Dagbladet that Fritt Ord's financial support for Fjordman was ""unacceptable.""[15] Fritt Ord's leader Georg Fredrik Rieber-Mohn said the decision to provide grants to Fjordman was very difficult.[16] The decision was supported by Aftenposten journalist Erik Tornes who argued the grant was a cheap prize to pay to get ""the extremists out of the echochambers""[17] and by Norway's Minister of Culture Hadia Tajik.[18]"

This program is directed to institutions, communities and companies. The main objective is to give moral awareness about this problem, trying to find better and healthier choices for life, through the participation and commitment of employers and their employees."
Garfield Weston Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_Weston_Foundation	"The Garfield Weston Foundation is a grant-giving charity based in the United Kingdom. It was established in 1958 by Canadian businessman W. Garfield Weston (1898–1978),[3] who during his lifetime contributed to numerous humanitarian causes, both personally and through his companies. His philanthropic works continue through the Garfield Weston Foundation in London and the W. Garfield Weston Foundation in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
 The Garfield Weston Foundation is one of the largest charitable foundations in the world, with assets of £9.7 billion at 5 April 2017, of which a majority was attributed to the foundation's majority holding in Wittington Investments Limited. [2]
 The Garfield Weston Foundation gave Oxford University £25 million for the refurbishment of the New Library (built originally in the 1930s as part of the Bodleian Library)[4][5] and re-opened to the public in March 2015 as the Weston Library.[6] The Foundation has given grants to a number of schools, including St Michael's Primary School and Brackenbury Primary School for new classrooms and outdoor play areas for sport,[7] and is a sponsor of Baker Dearing Educational Trust which promotes University Technical Colleges.[8]
 In 2010, the Charity Commission found that between 1993 and 2004 the charity had given donations to the UK Conservative Party that totalled £900,000, which were in breach of UK charity law; as were similar donations to the right-wing think tank the Centre for Policy Studies, and to Eurosceptic European political lobby groups such as the European Foundation and the Labour Euro-Safeguards Campaign.[9]
 In 2011, companies owned by Wittington Investments Limited were targeted over tax avoidance by the protest group UK Uncut. Private Eye linked the Garfield Weston Foundation's political donations with the Conservative Party's decision to grant tax breaks for the kind of offshore arrangements used in the tax avoidance.[citation needed]"
GEFEK	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEFEK	"GEFEK, the Association for the Promotion of Independent Disease Control in Developing Countries (""Gesellschaft zur Förderung Eigenständiger Krankheitsbekämpfung in Entwicklungsländern"") was created by scientists of the University of Giessen, Germany, in 2004 and is officially registered as a non-profit organisation. The association aims at promoting the exchange of medical knowledge and biomedical technology between industry nations and countries with a low health standard, such as Mongolia, Panama, Bolivia and Yemen.
 Infectious diseases are worldwide a major cause of death, especially in developing countries. Next to inexpensive drugs, there is an urgent need for affordable diagnostic methods. Recent progress in biomedical research led to new techniques highly appropriate for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. These new methods are advantageous not only because they lead to results in short time, but also because they are affordable and applicable under conditions of poverty. Major objective of GEFEK is the transfer of this knowledge to scientists in low-income countries and to establish the new technology in a way that it can be performed without help from abroad. The transfer includes information on the theoretical background, the performance of molecular diagnostic methods and the knowledge for the production of the necessary test substances. The self-contained operation of this technology by the affected population is the best guarantee for their sustainable application.
 In contrast to other organisations, which provide help directly in crisis regions, the contribution of GEFEK consists in the transfer of basic medical knowledge and technology, in order to help the people in poor countries according to the principle ""help to self-help"". A lot of health problems are not due in the first instance to a lack of medicines, but rather to the lack of appropriate methods for the diagnosis of the affecting diseases. Frequently, there are no adequate diagnostic methods available which could be used, or the available methods are inaffordable, this means, considerably more expensive than the needed drugs. GEFEK not only teaches physicians and technical personal but also the new scientific generation, i.e. students in medicine and other health-related disciplines.
 Members of GEFEK are cooperating with doctors from the Health Science University of Mongolia in the capital Ulaanbaatar. The objective of the common efforts is a countrywide evaluation of the distribution of most important infectious diseases, to enable specific control measures against these major causes of morbidity in the population. Within this cooperation and thanks to private donations, a laboratory in Ulaanbaatar was completely equipped with apparatuses needed for adequate performance of molecular diagnosis. Members of GEFEK were there repeatedly (2004 and 2005) to install the technology and to train Mongolian scientists. In this laboratory it is meanwhile possible to diagnose all important sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, brucellosis, several respiratory pathogens and several diarrhoeal diseases. All these methods are specially designed to be used under limited technical and economical conditions. In the long term it is planned to enable Mongolian scientists to produce all substances needed for the continuation of the diagnosis themselves, such as recombinant diagnostic antigens, or Taq polymerase. In the future, this may make the country independent from help from abroad.
 The population of Bolivia suffers from a multiplicity of infectious diseases, such as Chagas disease. Because of its inapparent symptoms, the disease remains unrecognised most of the time and, untreated, leads after about 20 years to death, mainly due to heart pathologies. It is probably one of the major reasons for the extreme low average age of the population of 34 years only. Further prevalent existing diseases are malaria and, especially among young children, life-threatening diarrhoeal diseases, caused by entamoeba, bacteria or rotavirus. Tuberculosis, dengue fever and different forms of hepatitis are also wide spread. The diagnostic methods developed by GEFEK can be very useful for the fight against Chagas disease. A cooperation has been arranged with the national Chagas disease control initiative at the Universidad Mayor de San Simón, in Cochabamba.
 In July 2006, a one-week practical course was organised at the Universidad Autónoma de Chiriquí in David, Panama. About 20 students and 3 professors participated in the course. Although Panama belongs to the richest countries in Central America, the general medical care – except of Panama City - is not well developed. Many infectious diseases are common, which are neither correctly diagnosed nor treated."

German Foundation for World Population	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Foundation_for_World_Population	"DSW (Deutsche Stiftung Weltbevoelkerung) (German: Deutsche Stiftung Weltbevölkerung) is an international non-governmental organisation addressing Sexual & Reproductive Health (SRH) and population dynamics. DSW funds its project and advocacy work from private donations and the financial support of governments, foundations and other organisations.[2][3][4][5]
It has its headquarters in Hannover, Germany.
 DSW was founded in 1991 as a private non-profit foundation by German entrepreneurs Erhard Schreiber and Dirk Rossmann. DSW opened country offices in the 1990s, in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, to provide field-based services. In 2000, DSW opened an EU Liaison office in Brussels, Belgium, to help mobilize resources in the European Union—collectively the world’s largest donor of development assistance[6]—to improve global health with a focus on sexual and reproductive health.
 DSW’s activities are focused on promoting sustainable demographic development, empowering women and their role in society, reducing and limiting the spread of HIV/AIDS, and improving the quality of life of young people in developing countries.[2]
 DSW runs a Youth-to-Youth Initiative in East Africa that attempts to empower youth to play an active role in improving Sexual & Reproductive Health in their communities and their countries, through peer education, advocacy and income-generating activities.[7] In implementing this program, DSW supports over 1,000 youth clubs with a combined total membership of 30,000 youth and adolescents.[8]
 In Europe, DSW is involved in awareness-raising activities about the links between population dynamics, environment and health.[10] Abroad, DSW promotes development projects in countries with a high need for family planning, sexual and reproductive health education and other services related to SRH, particularly those countries most afflicted by poor indicators for Millennium Development Goals 3 and 5 (child mortality and maternal health).[2][11]
 Officially registered as a foundation under German law, DSW provides sub-granting to other civil society actors advocating in the field of SRH, in addition to conducting advocacy itself. DSW seeks to engage both corporate and political actors to ensure that sexual and reproductive health education and contraception is strengthened and financially supported in developing countries.[12]  This includes activities such as liaising with governments, parliamentarians and partner organizations at the national and international levels in Europe and the Global South to vote in favour of SRH-related legislation, or to increase funding for sexual and reproductive health programmes generally.[13] DSW produces an annual Euromapping report, which scrutinizes EU Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitments and disbursements.[14][15]
 DSW also plays a capacity building role in developing countries to increase civil society's ability to advocate effectively towards governments and donors to integrate SRH in their ODA contributions. DSW runs two training centres in Uganda and Ethiopia, supported by German women’s clothing chain BONITA GmbH & Co. KG, that focus on the capacity building of youth-serving organizations to address questions about health, sexuality and contraception.[16]
 In 2005, DSW helped found the Alfred Biolek Stiftung on AIDS in Africa, and continues to provide administrative support for their activities.
 DSW relies on the advice of notable international experts and public figures on various thematic issues, including Alfred Biolek, Margot Kaessmann, Nafis Sadik, Rita Sussmuth, Klaus Topfer and Ernst Ulrich von Weizsaecker.

Gill Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill_Foundation	"The Gill Foundation is one of the largest funders of efforts to secure full equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in the United States.[1] The foundation's mission is ""to secure equal opportunity for all Americans, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity and expression."" [2][3]
 Based in Denver, Colorado, the foundation has four board members: Tim Gill, Scott Miller, Mary Bonauto, and Eliza Byard.[4]
 The Gill Foundation was founded by Tim Gill in 1994, two years after the passage of Amendment 2, a Colorado ballot initiative denying lesbian, gay, and bisexual people equal protection under the law. As of 2017, the foundation had granted more than $335 million to various nonprofits.[5]
 In 2004, the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), the largest association of charitable fundraisers in the world, honored the Gill Foundation with its 2004 Outstanding Foundation award.[6]
 The Gill Foundation is most known for its support of nonprofit organizations across the country working to bring about equality for LGBT people. Beyond its grant-making, the foundation also has been recognized for its OutGiving program, through which the foundation seeks to build a larger base of philanthropists giving strategically in support of LGBT causes.[7] In recognition of the OutGiving program, Liberty Hill Foundation honored Tim Gill with its Upton Sinclair Award in 2011 ""for his vision, passion and leadership in helping to create and continuing to inspire the modern day LGBTQ donor movement.""[7][8]
 The Gill Foundation invests a significant portion of its funding in its home state of Colorado, supporting nonprofits working to improve the quality of life for all Colorado residents. In 2016, $1.7 million was invested in Colorado organizations.[9] The foundation is particularly well known in Colorado for its Gay & Lesbian Fund for Colorado program. The Gay & Lesbian Fund's $1 million challenge grant in 2005 to the Mile High chapter of American Red Cross was one of the largest non-corporate donations in the country for Hurricane Katrina disaster relief.[10]
 At its inception, the Gill Foundation office was based in Colorado Springs. In June 2012, to consolidate operations, the Gill Foundation closed down the office in Colorado Springs while continuing its presence in Denver. The foundation donated the Colorado Springs building to Rocky Mountain PBS to create the Tim Gill Center for Public Media.The foundation reevaluated the future direction of the Gay & Lesbian Fund, although it remains committed to its Colorado programs.[11]"
Girl Scouts of the USA	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA	"Girl Scouts of the United States of America (GSUSA), commonly referred to as simply Girl Scouts, is a youth organization for girls in the United States and American girls living abroad.[2] Founded by Juliette Gordon Low in 1912, it was organized after Low met Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting, in 1911.[3] Upon returning to Savannah, Georgia, she telephoned a distant cousin, saying, ""I've got something for the girls of Savannah, and all of America, and all the world, and we're going to start it tonight!""[4]
 Girl Scouts prepares girls to empower themselves and promotes compassion, courage, confidence, character, leadership, entrepreneurship, and active citizenship through activities involving camping, community service, learning first aid, and earning badges by acquiring practical skills. Girl Scouts' achievements are recognized with various special awards, including the Girl Scout Gold, Silver, and Bronze Awards.
 Girl Scout membership is organized according to grade, with activities designed for each level. GSUSA is a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) and accepts girls of all backgrounds.
 A 1994 Chronicle of Philanthropy poll showed Girl Scouts ranked by the public as the eighth ""most popular charity/non-profit in America"" among more than 100 charities.[5][6][needs update] It describes itself as ""the world's preeminent organization dedicated solely to girls.""[7]
 Girl Scouting in the United States of America began on March 12, 1912, when Juliette ""Daisy"" Gordon Low organized the first Girl Guide troop meeting of 18 girls in Savannah, Georgia. It has since grown to 3.7 million members.[4] Low, who had met Baden-Powell in London while she was living in the United Kingdom, dreamed of giving the United States and the world ""something for all the girls."" She envisioned an organization that would bring girls out of their homes to serve their communities, experience the out-of-doors, and have the opportunity to develop ""self-reliance and resourcefulness."" From its inception, the Girl Scouts has been organized and run exclusively by women, for girls and women.[8]
 Juliette Gordon Low was the granddaughter of Juliette Magill Kinzie and John Harris Kinzie, whose childhood family was one of the earliest settlers of Chicago, IL. Juliette Kinzie wrote about her experiences in the Northwest Territory (now the state of Wisconsin) in her book Wau-Bun: The Early Day. Some of what her granddaughter, Juliette Gordon Low, knew firsthand about her grandmother's experiences on the frontier were incorporated into the beginnings and traditions of Girl Scouts. The early home of Juliette Low's grandparents can be visited May 15 through October 15 in Portage, Wisconsin.[9]
 In late 1912, Low proposed that the Camp Fire Girls merge with the Girl Guides but was rejected in January 1913 as Camp Fire was then the larger group. Next, Low attempted to merge her organization with the Girl Scouts of America which was founded in Des Moines, Iowa by Clara Lisetor-Lane. She thought their similarities would make this easier but Lisetor-Lane felt Daisy copycatted her organization and threatened to sue. Lisetor-Lane later claimed Low's organization was luring members away but the GSA's growth was limited by a lack of financial resources which led to its eventual demise.[10]
 The Girl Guides of America in 1913 changed its name to Girl Scouts of the United States and moved its headquarters to Washington, DC.[10] In 1915 the organization was incorporated[11] and the national headquarters was moved to New York City.[10] The name reached its current form, Girl Scouts of the United States of America, in 1947. The organization was given a congressional charter on March 16, 1950.
 GSUSA started with 18 members. Within months, members were hiking through the woods in knee-length blue uniforms, playing basketball on a curtained-off court, and going on camping trips. In 1916, Low established an aviation badge—even before women could vote. By 1920, there were nearly 70,000 members.[12] By 1923 the organization had branches in every state in the union, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, and a total membership of 125,738.[11] In 1930 it had over 200,000. In 2013 there were over 3.2 million Girl Scouts: 2.3 million girl members and 890,000 adult members in the United States.[12] More than 50 million American women have participated in Girl Scouts. Through its membership in WAGGGS, GSUSA girls and adults are among over 10 million members in 146 countries.[12]
 The names and ages of the levels and the larger structure of the program have changed significantly over time. In 1923 Girl Scouts were organized into patrols, troops, local councils, and the National Council.[11] Troops were initially fairly independent before joining together into small councils, which recently merged to form larger councils. Today there are over 100 councils across the U.S.[12]
 The Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace, located in Savannah, Georgia, in the former Gordon family home, became the national Girl Scout program center in 1956.[13] It provides tours to thousands of Girl Scouts yearly. Upon Low's death in 1927, she willed her carriage house, which would eventually become The Girl Scout First Headquarters, to the local Savannah Girl Scouts for continued use.[14] In 1923 national headquarters was located at 189 Lexington Avenue, New York.[11]
 During World War II, 1943–1945, many young Japanese American girls were confined in internment camps with their families. Girl Scout troops were organized, even in these camps. These girls participated in many activities, including dramatic presentations that took place in the Crystal City Internment Camp in Crystal City, Texas.
 Most Girl Scout units were originally segregated by race according to state and local laws and customs. The first troop for African American girls was founded in 1917; the first American Indian troop was formed in New York State in 1921; and the first troop for Mexican Americans was formed in Houston, Texas, in 1922. In 1933, Josephine Groves Holloway founded unofficial African American troops in Tennessee. She also fully desegregated the Cumberland Valley council in 1962.[15] The first official African American troop in the South was founded in 1932 in Richmond, Virginia by Lena B. Watson and led initially by Lavnia Banks, a teacher from Armstrong High School. It first met in Hartshorn Hall at Virginia Union University.[16]
 By the 1950s, GSUSA had begun significant national efforts to desegregate the camps and maintain racial balance. One of the first desegregations, accomplished by Murray Walls in 1956, was Camp Shantituck in Kentucky.[17] Later the same year, Martin Luther King, Jr. described Girl Scouts as ""a force for desegregation"".[18] In 1969, a national Girl Scout initiative called Action 70 was created that aimed to eliminate prejudice. Gloria D. Scott, an African American, was elected national president of Girl Scouts in 1975.[19]
 The Wing Scout program was a Senior Girl Scout program for girls interested in flying and wanting to serve their country that started in 1941 and ended in the 1970s. In July 1942, 29 troop leaders from 15 states met in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to take Wing Scout leadership training. They returned to their councils and began setting up Wing Scout troops. In 1959, the Girl Scout council in North San Mateo County, California, was presented with an offer from United Airlines San Francisco Management Club President J. L. Burnside to start an aviation program for Senior Girl Scouts. One of the highlights of the Wing Scout program was the courtesy flight provided to Senior Girl Scouts using United Airlines' jets. For many of the girls, this was the first time they had flown in a plane. Senior Girl Scouts who had been in the program for three years were given the opportunity to take over the controls during flight in a small aircraft. The program was discontinued after United Airlines experienced financial setbacks in the 1970s.[20]
 The program was originally for girls ages 10 to 18, but it was subsequently divided into three levels. Brownies (for younger girls) was based on a program developed in England in 1914 and was officially recognized in the mid-1920s. At the same time, girls over 18, or over 16 if First Class Scouts, became known as Senior Scouts. In 1938, the age divisions were: Brownies (ages 7 through 9), Intermediates (ages 10 through 13), and Seniors (ages 14 through 18).[21]
 In 1965 the age structure was rearranged to Brownies (ages 7 and 8, or 2nd and 3rd grades), Juniors (ages 9 through 11, or 4th through 6th grades), Cadettes (ages 11 through 14, or 7th through 9th grades), and Seniors (ages 14 through 18, or 10th through 12th grades).[22] In the early 1970s, the Brownie level was extended to girls six years old or in the first grade, and the Daisy program for kindergarten girls or those age five was introduced in 1984.[23] The Daisy program began as a pilot program called Pixies in 1976.
 In 2003, the Studio 2B program for girls ages 11 to 17 was introduced for Cadettes and Seniors.[24] Studio 2B allowed girls to call themselves by any name of their choosing, including but not limited to ""Studio 2Bs,""[25] ""teen Girl Scouts,"" or Cadettes and Seniors. Under the Studio 2B programs, girls were able to work on traditional badges as well as Studio 2B activities, and the Silver Award and Gold Award requirements were rewritten to require both. Studio 2B activities differed from badges in two ways: each booklet focused on a topic such as environmentalism or self-confidence rather than being skill-based like a badge; and to earn each Studio 2B charm, the Girl Scout had to choose activities from the booklet and then meet a goal relevant to the booklet topic. She would create her own plan for achieving her goal, following a basic planning procedure called SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely).
 On October 1, 2008, all levels were renamed to have ""Girl Scout"" as the beginning of their name, e.g., Girl Scout Brownies instead of Brownie Girl Scouts, and all levels are by grade only instead of by age or grade. A new level, Girl Scout Ambassadors, was created for girls in grades 11 and 12 (around 16 to 18 years old), with Girl Scout Seniors to be only in ninth and tenth grade (around 14 to 16 years old), and sixth grade girls were reclassified from the Junior level to Cadette to conform with school grade levels. (By this time, sixth grade was considered a middle school rather than an elementary school grade.) The new levels were tried in approximately six councils in spring 2008 and were put to use nationally after October 1, 2008.
 Although troop membership has always and is still the most common way to participate in Girl Scouting, girls who do not have a local troop, or who do not desire or have the time to participate in traditional troop activities, can still sign up as individual Girl Scouts. Individual Girls Scouts were known in the early years of Girl Scouting as Lone Scouts and later as Juliettes; they attend activities independently and work individually on badges and awards. In 2015–2016, the term Juliette was phased out at the national level, in favor of the term Independent Girl Scouts, although some councils still use the term Juliette.
 The Campus Girl Scouts program allows women (ages 18 and older) to be active in Girl Scouting while in college. Campus Girl Scouting is an organization that helps promote and build student involvement in the community, the local council, and the college campus through service.[26]
 The 20th National Council of GSUSA launched the Mariner Girl Scout program in October 1934.[27] Similar to the Boy Scouts of America's Sea Scouting, the program was designed for older Girl Scouts interested in outdoor water-based activities. By the end of 1934, 12 Mariner ships were registered and the first two handbooks, Launching a Girl Scout Mariner Ship and Charting the Course of a Girl Scout Mariner Ship, were published. The Mariner Girl Scout program remains active but in a smaller form; most girls have instead joined Sea Scouting, which has been coed since 1971.[28]
 There are programs for girls in unusual situations that make it difficult for them to participate in the standard program. The Girl Scouts Beyond Bars program helps daughters of incarcerated mothers connect with their mothers and helps mothers participate in Girl Scout activities. Another program, Girl Scouting in Detention Centers, allows girls who are themselves in detention centers to participate in Scouting. Other initiatives try to help girls in rural areas or in public housing. There are also programs for American girls living overseas.[29]
 The national organization has its central headquarters in New York City. It is headed by a chief executive officer and a 40-member national board of directors. Sylvia Acevedo currently serves as the chief executive officer, and was officially appointed in May 2017. The chair of the national board of directors, the highest volunteer position, is Kathy Hopinkah Hannan.[30]
 Below the national organization are councils, which cover a large portion of a state or geographic region. Some councils own and run camps for the troops within their area of responsibility. Councils are usually subdivided into areas, called neighborhoods, service units, or associations (terms vary), which are program delivery areas that consist of troops at all age levels in a smaller area, such as a town.
 The basic unit is the troop which may or may not be sponsored. In contrast to Boy Scout troop-chartered organizations, Girl Scout troop sponsors do not own the troop. Troops range in size from as small as 5 to as large as 30 or more girls and may be divided into several patrols of 8 or fewer girls.
 In 2004, Girl Scouts of the USA hired a consultant ""to help Girl Scouts develop a strategy to ensure our future success and growth."" They set targets and implemented ways to change the organization for the better. In addition, six ""gap teams"" looked at ways Girl Scouts could improve its structure to prepare for future growth and success of the organization.[31] This followed declines in membership and in revenue, as well as challenges in subsidizing programs for inner-city girls. The governance gap team found that consolidation decreased confusion and provided economies of scale, and recommended an optimal council size of approximately 10,000 girls.[32] As of 2006, there were 312 regional Girl Scout councils, which own the 236,000 local troops and other groups.
 As part of a 2006 reorganization, the national board of directors consolidated the 312 councils into 109 councils.[33]
 This was not without resistance; the Manitou Girl Scout council in Wisconsin sued the national GSUSA in federal district court, alleging breach of the Girl Scout charter. Although the suit was summarily dismissed with prejudice by the district court,[32] the Seventh U.S. Circuit of Appeals overturned that decision, stating that a Girl Scout council agreement ""was no different than a Dunkin' Donuts franchise."" The decision of the appeals court maintained the status of the Manitou council. As a result, there are 112 Girl Scout councils in the United States.[34]
 Promise
 The Girl Scout Promise can be made in English, Spanish, or in American Sign Language with the same meaning.[35]
 On my honor, I will try:
To serve God and my country,
To help people at all times,
And to live by the Girl Scout Law.[36]
 The Promise is often recited at Girl Scout troop meetings while holding up the three middle fingers of the right hand, which forms the Girl Scout sign. Girl Scout policy states that the organization does not endorse or promote any particular philosophy or religious belief. The movement is nonsectarian, founded on American democratic principles, one of which is freedom of religion. In this context, the word ""God"" may be interpreted by each Girl Scout depending on her individual spiritual beliefs, and Girl Scouts are free to substitute the word consistent with their beliefs, such as ""Creator,"" ""my faith,"" ""Allah,"" etc.[37]
 The aim of Girl Scouts is to help girls pursue four goals: develop to their full potential; relate to others with increasing understanding, skill, and respect; develop a meaningful set of values to guide their actions and make sound decisions; and contribute to the improvement of society.[38]
 Law
 I will do my best to be
honest and fair,
friendly and helpful,
considerate and caring,
courageous and strong, and
responsible for what I say and do,
and to
respect myself and others,
respect authority,
use resources wisely,
make the world a better place, and
be a sister to every Girl Scout.[36]
 The Girl Scout Law has been changed several times since 1912. The original Girl Scout Law written by Juliette Gordon Low was:[39]
 The Girl Scout Law
 Motto
 Be prepared.[40]
 Slogan
 Do a good turn daily.[40]
 For girls ages 5 to 14, the unifying look includes wearing a choice of a tunic, vest, sash for displaying official pins and awards, combined with their own solid white shirts and khaki pants or skirts. Girl Scouts in high school can also wear a scarf that unites their look with the sisterhood of Girl Scouts around the world. For adult members the unifying look of the uniform is a Girl Scout official scarf or tie for men, worn with the official membership pins, combined with their own navy blue business attire. Girl Scouts at the Daisy and Brownie levels will continue to have a full uniform ensemble available.[41]
 Girl Scout uniforms have changed significantly over the years from the original navy blue in 1912, to khaki in 1914, to the familiar green. The evolution has included uniforms with the specificity to designate each age level of Girl Scouting. Since 2008, Girl Scouts at each level have one required element (tunic, sash or vest) for the display of official pins and awards which will be required when girls participate in ceremonies or officially represent the Girl Scout Movement.
 For all levels, earned awards go on the front of the vest or sash following official placements. Fun patches can be displayed on the back of a vest or sash. Girl Scout Daisies can choose a blue vest or a smock with a full uniform or white shirt and khaki pants and skirt. They have their own Daisy pin and a choice of accessories. Girl Scout Brownies can choose a traditional brown vest or sash to be worn with the historic Brownie pin and other uniform pieces or white shirt and khaki pants or skirts. Girl Scout Juniors wear their official vest or sash to display insignia including awards, coupled with a white shirt and khaki pants or skirt. Girl Scout Cadettes, Seniors, and Ambassadors can choose a khaki sash or vest to go with khaki pants or skirt and a white shirt.
 The adult uniform also changed, with registered women and men wearing navy blue business attire, again from their regular wardrobes. Also available for women are official sweaters and an insignia scarf, while men have the option of an official tie.[41][42]
  The emblem designed by Juliette Low was the only emblem used for Girl Scout pins through 1980. At the 1978 GSUSA National Convention, the use of two logos was voted on, allowing Girl Scouts to pick which they wanted to wear as their Girl Scout pin (for Girl Scout Juniors and up).
 The current Girl Scouts of the USA logo is a rejuvenation of the original logo based on Saul Bass' 1978 design[43][44]
, Bass being a graphic designer known for his motion picture title sequences and design of various other well known logos. In 2010, the hair and facial styles were updated by Jennifer Kinon and Bobby C. Martin, Jr. of The Original Champions of Design.[45][46]
 One of the original and continuing attractions of Girl Scouts is that girls become proficient campers and participate in many outdoor activities such as canoeing or backpacking with their troops. Troops do service projects such as carrying out flag ceremonies, collecting food for food drives, visiting nursing homes, and Christmas caroling or other community services.[47] Troops may also plan and take extended trips within the United States or even to another country. Troops may organize cultural or learning events such as first-aid training or attending live theater. The Girl Scout activity most familiar to the general public may be the annual sale of Girl Scout Cookies, which started in 1917 as a money-earning opportunity for councils and troops.
 In the past few years, Girl Scouts has incorporated STEM-related programs and badges in order to encourage more interest in Scouts in STEM fields.[48] From 2005 to 2007, more than 8.6 million STEM-related badges were sold.[49] The first STEM-related Girl Scout badges, though, can be traced back to the 1913 Electrician and Flyer Badges.[50] The first computer-related badges appeared in the 1980s.[50] In 2001, The Girl Scout Research Institute, published a 36-page report about the need for more encouragement to get girls into the field of technology.[51] An even larger push for STEM programs came after a 2012 study by the Girl Scout Research Institute reported that 74% of teenage girls were interested in courses in STEM subjects while only 25% of STEM industry jobs were held by women.[52] Recent endeavors to encourage interest in
STEM fields amongst Girl Scouts includes partnerships with companies like NASA,[53] AT&T,[54] and Lockheed Martin.[55] NASA specifically paired the Girl Scouts with the SETI Institute to create a 5-year space education program for called ""Reaching for the Stars: NASA Science for Girl Scouts.""[56] The most recent push to help Girl Scouts imagine a future in STEM was the Girl Scout's appearance at the International Consumer Electronics Show in January 2016 to show off Digital Cookie 2.0, a website made in partnership with Dell and Visa, that helps Girl Scouts manage their cookie business online.[57]
 Girl Scouts currently has thirty six badges under the STEM category.[58] The Naturalist, Digital Art, Science and Technology, Innovation, and Financial Literacy badge categories are all listed on the Girl Scout's website as badge categories able to be connected with STEM lessons and projects.[58]
 In June 2017, Girl Scouts announced a partnership with Palo Alto Networks to create 18 cybersecurity badges by September 2018.[59]
 Once known as ""Wider Opportunities"" or Wider Ops, Destinations are travel opportunities for individual older Girl Scouts. Destinations are held within the United States and in other countries. Destinations are primarily international, outdoor, science, people, or apprenticeship oriented,[60] such as kayaking in Alaska, or career oriented such as learning about working for NASA.[61]
 A ""Destination"" may be a trip to one of the WAGGGS World Centres:
 The Girl Scouts of the USA have many customs and traditions: camping, community service, singing, and money earning to support their activities. The Girl Scout Handshake and the Girl Scout signal for silence are two shared by WAGGGS member organizations. Other traditions include the Friendship Circle with ""the squeeze,"" taking bandanas and homemade sit-upons on camping trips, and the buddy system.
 ""Bridging"" is the process of going from one level to another. Bridging is usually done at the troop level, although area bridgings are often held. The girls that are bridging walk across a bridge to their new level and are greeted with the Girl Scout Handshake. There is a notable bridging ceremony held in San Francisco, as GS Juniors bridge to GS Cadettes over the Golden Gate Bridge.
 World Thinking Day and ""Girl Scouts' Own"" are traditions throughout the world of Girl Scouting. World Thinking Day has occurred annually since 1926 on February 22, the birthday of both Robert Baden-Powell and Olave Baden-Powell. On World Thinking Day, Girl Scouts and Guides around the world think about their sisters in other lands;[63] Councils or local service units (associations) hold a celebration on or near this day, in which each participating troop gives a presentation of the culture and customs of a country selected by the troop. Many Girl Scouts in America celebrate Juliette Gordon Low's birthday on October 31, Founder's Day. The parties often include the girls dressing up in Halloween costumes, and serving birthday cake.
 A ""Girl Scouts' Own"" is a special ceremony that expresses the spirit of Girl Scouting when the girls reflect upon their feelings about Girl Scouting and the world around them. A ""Girl Scouts' Own"" can have any theme, or none at all. It is a solemn time given for Girl Scouts to create a moment of their very own. It can be held at any time and include the girls' troop or be held at any inter-troop gathering.[64]
 All levels of Girl Scouts can earn badges.  Each level has specific badges that can be earned.  Daisies earn badges shaped like flowers.  Brownies earn badges shaped like triangles.  Juniors earn badges shaped like circles.  Cadettes earn badges shaped like diamonds.  Seniors earn badges shaped like rectangles.  Ambassadors earn badges shaped like squares.
 Earned Badges and Awards are worn on the front of a Girl Scout's vest (or sash).  Fun Patches are worn on the back of the vest.  Daisies wear blue vests.  Brownies wear brown vests.  Juniors wear green vests.  Cadettes, Seniors, and Ambassadors wear khaki vests.  For Cadettes, Seniors, and Ambassadors, a Girl Scout may choose wear the same khaki vest for all three levels.  Active Girl Scouts, who earn a lot of badges, may opt to get a new khaki vest when they change levels so they have more room to display their awards.
 Each level of Girl Scouting has multiple Journey programs.  A Journey is a series of lessons particular topic.  The Journeys are made up of multiple parts and all parts of the Journey must be earned for it to be complete. A Girl Scout who completes three Journeys at one level earns a Summit Pin. Before beginning work on a Bronze, Silver or Gold Award project, a Girl Scout must complete one Journey at her level.  A Girl Scout who did not earn her Silver Award must complete two Journeys at her current level, instead of one, work on her Gold Award.
 Girl Scouts can earn other awards, usually represented by pins.  Some of these awards are:  Leadership Torch, Community Service Bar, Service to Girl Scouting Bar, Bronze Cross, Medal of Honor, Cookie Activity Pin, Safety Pin, My Promise My Faith Pin, Counselor in Training I & II, Volunteer in Training, World Thinking Day Award, and Global Action Award.
 Girl Scouts can also earn and display on their uniform awards from outside organizations, such as the religious emblems from religious organizations, or the President's Volunteer Service Award.
 The highest achievement in Girl Scouting is the Girl Scout Gold Award, which can only be earned by Girl Scout Seniors and Ambassadors. The highest award for Girl Scout Cadettes is the Silver Award, and Bronze Award is the highest award for Girl Scout Juniors. These awards require large-scale service projects showing leadership along with service hours.[66]
 The Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest honor a Girl Scout can earn. This award can be earned by Girl Scout Seniors and Girl Scout Ambassadors.  This prestigious award represents a Girl Scout's dedication and commitment to Girl Scouting and to her community. Earning the Girl Scout Gold Award requires hard work and a willingness to take on significant responsibility. For many, the leadership and organizational skills and sense of community and commitment that come from earning the Gold Award set the foundation for a lifetime of active citizenship.   The Gold Award project takes a minimum of 80 hours to complete.
 The Silver Award, the highest honor a Girl Scout Cadette can earn, gives girls the chance to do big things and make their community better in the process. The Silver Award takes the participants through a seven-step process: identify an issue, build a Girl Scout Silver Award team, explore the community needs, choose a project, develop the project, make a plan, and put it into motion.  The Silver Award project takes a minimum of 50 hours to complete.
 The Bronze Award, the highest honor a Girl Scout Junior can earn, requires girls to learn the leadership and planning skills necessary to follow through on a project that makes a positive impact on her community. Working toward this award demonstrates a Girl Scout's commitment to helping others, improving her community and the world, and becoming the best she can be. The Bronze Award project takes a minimum of 20 hours to complete.
 There are also GS awards for adults including: Outstanding Volunteer, Outstanding Leader, Appreciation Pin, Honor Pin, Thanks Badge, and Thanks Badge II. Outstanding Volunteer is awarded for Outstanding service as Girl Scout volunteer (other than a leader). Outstanding Leader is awarded for Outstanding service as Girl Scout leader. Appreciation Pin is awarded for exceptional performance beyond expectations for the position. The Honor Pin recognizes an adult member who has delivered exceptional service beyond expectations to two or more geographic areas, service units or program delivery audiences in a way that furthers the council's goals.[67] Thanks Badge recognizes outstanding service for two or more ""service units"". Different GS councils use different terminology for regions within their council. Thanks Badge II is awarded where the recipient has received the Thanks Badge and the recipient's service continues to merit further recognition. At least one nomination, two endorsements, and a review of the forms is required for each of these awards.[68]
 Among the many famous American Girl Scouts are Dakota Fanning, Lucille Ball, Katie Couric, and Elizabeth Dole.[69] Many Girl Scouts have become successful leaders in numerous professional fields such as law, medicine, politics, journalism, and science.[69] Beginning with Lou Henry Hoover, the incumbent First Lady has served as the Honorary President of GSUSA. Lou Henry Hoover was also the actual President of the Girl Scouts from 1922 to 1925 and Chairman of the National Board of Directors from 1925 to 1928.[70]
 During World War I and World War II, girls involved in Scouts helped the Allied forces by selling defense bonds, growing victory gardens, and collecting waste fat and scrap iron.[71] Girl Scouts also spread their values into their communities through community service projects such as soup kitchens and food drives.
 Over twenty of NASA's career astronauts were former Girl Scouts. The first American woman to spacewalk was a former Girl Scout, Dr. Kathryn Sullivan.[72]
 From 1917 until 1979 Girl Scouts published a magazine, originally called The Rally (1917–1920) and then The American Girl, with ""The"" later dropped (but not to be confused with the currently published American Girl magazine).[73] Circulation exceed 200,000 in the 1940s,[74] and at one time this magazine had the largest circulation of any magazine aimed at teen-aged girls.[when?][citation needed]
 International Girl Scout gatherings named Senior Roundups were held every three years from 1956 until 1965:[75]
 When the Girl Scouts were first organized the organization claimed to be ""non-sectarian in practice as well as theory"". By the early 1920s Catholic Girl Scout units had been founded in New York, Philadelphia, Washington and other cities. In the 1920s about 2,000 Girl Scouts were Catholic.[11]  From its founding in 1912, it had Jewish leaders and scouts.[76]
 Since 1993, Girl Scouts have been able to substitute something appropriate to their own beliefs for the phrase ""To serve God"" in the Girl Scout Promise. This option appears in the guidelines distributed to adult volunteers but not in the actual girls' books. Official volunteer documentation contains this note:[77]
 Girl Scouts of the USA makes no attempt to define or interpret the word “God” in the Girl Scout Promise. It looks to individual members to establish for themselves the nature of their spiritual beliefs. When making the Girl Scout Promise, individuals may substitute wording appropriate to their own spiritual beliefs for the word ""God.""
 This note or a shorter variant also frequently appears on local council web pages.[78][79]
 Volunteers are reminded ""to be sensitive to the spiritual beliefs of the girls in your group and to make sure that everyone in the group feels comfortable and included in Girl Scouting"" and to feel free to share the policy with the girls' families.[77]
 The policy change was prompted by attempts to be more inclusive and lawsuits. Atheist parents sued the Boy Scouts of America in 1991 for denying membership in the Cub Scouts to their sons. Considering this news, the Totem Girl Scout Council of Seattle attempted to change the Girl Scout Promise to make mention of ""God"" optional, which would be more inclusive of local non-theist Native American and Southeast Asian girls. After the national organization asserted this could not be changed locally, the Seattle council advocated that the change be adopted nation-wide.
In November 1992, the parents of Nitzya Cuevas-Macias sued for their daughter to be permitted to participate in the Girl Scouts even though she refused to promise to serve God.[80][81]
 On October 23, 1993, at the Girl Scouts of the USA annual national convention, delegates voted 1,560 ""yes"" against 375 ""no""[82][83] to permit individuals to substitute another word or phrase for ""God"" in their promise.[37] The convention gave this explanation:
 For some individuals, the word ""God"", no matter how broadly interpreted, does not appropriately reflect their spiritual beliefs. Since the belief in a spiritual principle is fundamental to Girl Scouting, not the word used to define that belief, it is important that individuals have the opportunity to express that belief in wording meaningful to them. It is essential to maintain the spiritual foundation of Girl Scouting, yet be inclusive of the full range of spiritual beliefs. This [policy change] does not take the word ""God"" out of the Girl Scout Promise. It gives those individuals who wish to do so the option to state their commitment to the spiritual concepts fundamental to the Movement with a word or words more appropriate to their own beliefs. For instance, an individual may say ""my faith"" or ""Allah"" or ""the Creator"".[84]
 This policy change settled the Cuevas-Macias lawsuit.[85]
 Some consider that the Girl Scouts of the USA have not gone far enough in making Scouting open to non-theists; others that they have gone too far in removing God or that they are violating the constitution of the WAGGGS. In 2017, some parents still find the perceived religious aspects of the Girl Scouts enough of a reason not to sign up their daughters to participate.[86] The WAGGGS constitution requires member societies to maintain membership standards to include a promise similar to the one established by Baden-Powell, which includes the concept of duty to God.[87][88][89] The GSUSA policy adopted in 1993 led to the 1995 formation of an alternative organization, the American Heritage Girls that accepts only leaders and chartering organizations that agree with a specific Christian statement of faith.[90] The organization had a little over 5,000 members in 2006. According to the organization, membership as of 2017 is over 43,000.[91]
 The official Girl Scout policy does not ban or require prayer.[92]
 The Girl Scout organization does not endorse or promote any particular philosophy or religious belief. Our movement is secular and is founded on American democratic principles, one of which is freedom of religion.
 Although Girl Scouts has policies supporting religious diversity, there is no policy by Girl Scouts of the USA that prohibits or requires the saying or singing of a grace, blessing, or invocation before meals by Girl Scout members in a troop/group setting, in a resident or day camp, or at meetings, conferences, and other large events. The decision to say a grace, blessing, or invocation is made locally at the troop or group level, and should be sensitive to the spiritual beliefs of all participants.
 Girl Scouts of the USA has an optional ""My Promise, My Faith"" pin which girls in all grades may earn.[93] Girls may also do religious recognition programs and wear the resulting emblem on their uniform; however, these are created and administered by the religious organizations and not by the Girl Scouts directly.[93]
 Girl Scouts of the USA stated in an October 1991 letter:[94]
 As a private organization, Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. respects the values and beliefs of each of its members and does not intrude into personal matters. Therefore, there are no membership policies on sexual preference. However, Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. has firm standards relating to the appropriate conduct of adult volunteers and staff. The Girl Scout organization does not condone or permit sexual displays of any sort by its members during Girl Scout activities, nor does it permit the advocacy or promotion of a personal lifestyle or sexual preference. These are private matters for girls and their families to address.
 GSUSA upholds a ""don't ask, don't evangelize"" policy on sexuality.[95] The debate over this issue is split between those who feel that the policy should avoid and prevent discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and those who question the inclusion of lesbians.[96][97]
 In October 2011, the Girl Scouts of Colorado council publicly stated, ""If a child identifies as a girl and the child's family presents her as a girl, Girl Scouts of Colorado welcomes her as a Girl Scout"", when overturning a local troop's rejection of a seven-year-old transgender girl.[98] In July 2015, the Girl Scouts of Western Washington returned a $100,000 donation after the donor stipulated that the money could not be used to support services for transgender Scouts. The group then set up an online fundraising campaign to recoup the lost funds, ultimately raising $250,000.[99]
 In January 2012, a teen in California created a video calling for the boycott of Girl Scout Cookies in response to the Girl Scouts' policy of inclusion for transgender girls. The viral video became a rallying cry for both supporters and opponents of the group's stance on transgender members.[100] In February 2016, Robert James Carlson, the Roman Catholic archbishop of St. Louis, urged parishioners to cut ties with the Girl Scouts over the group's embrace of LGBT rights.[101]
 The Girl Scouts themselves defended their actions against this. ""For 100 years, Girl Scouts has prided itself on being an inclusive organization serving girls from all walks of life. We handle cases involving transgender children on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on ensuring the welfare and best interests of the child in question and the other girls in the troop as our highest priority.""[102]
 GSUSA is not aligned with and does not endorse, at the national level, the reproductive health organization Planned Parenthood; Girl Scout councils may choose to have or not have connections with Planned Parenthood.[103] In 2003, in Waco, Texas, the local Bluebonnet Council was listed as a co-sponsor—with the Girl Scouts logo printed on the promotional flyer—of the Planned Parenthood of Central Texas event titled ""Nobody's Fool '03: Dating, Love, Sex & HIV.""[2] In 2004, the same Council promoted a Planned Parenthood education event without providing money nor sending Girl Scouts to it. This was criticized by some pro-life movement supporters and social conservatives, resulting in a local attempt to boycott Girl Scout cookies sold by the Bluebonnet Council. Waco residents responded to the announced boycott by purchasing a record amount of cookies, and the Bluebonnet Council dropped promotion of the event.[104] A month later, GSUSA CEO Kathy Cloninger went on NBC's Today show, defending the Bluebonnet Council's decision to sever ties with Planned Parenthood.
 The title has changed over the years.[114]

 GSUSA celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding by Juliette Low with a ""Bridge to the Second Century"" event on November 13, 2011, at the GS National Convention in Houston and other sites around the country. The Anniversary was also celebrated by participation in the world-famous Pasadena, California Tournament of Roses Parade of 2012, featuring the Girl Scouts 100th Anniversary float, which was designed and decorated by Girl Scouts.[118]
 US President Barack Obama signed the ""Girl Scouts of the USA Commemorative Coin Act"" for the 100th Anniversary celebration. The act authorized the minting of 350,000 silver dollar coins in honor of Girl Scouts and the achievements of the 50 million women influenced by Girl Scouting during the last 100 years.[119]
 Colorado staged a vigorous campaign to create a special license plate to honor the Girl Scout Centennial. The Girl Scouts of Minnesota and Wisconsin River Valleys hosted ""The Great Girl Gathering"", a Centennial Celebration on March 10 and 11, 2012 for 140,000 girls at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota.[120]
 Build-A-Bear Workshop had a limited edition Girl Scout bear and outfits for the 100th anniversary.
 The Girl Scout Council of the Nation's Capital in Washington, DC hosted a 100th Anniversary Sing-Along on the National Mall, on June 9, 2012 called Girl Scouts Rock the Mall: 100th Anniversary Sing-Along.[121] The Rock the Mall event drew more than 200,000 people to the national mall to celebrate Girl Scouting and cost $2 million.[122]
 Girl Scouts of Citrus, in partnership with Walt Disney World, held a special 100th anniversary bridging event on May 25–28, 2012. The Bridging into the Next Century event provides Girl Scouts from all over the country an opportunity to celebrate the spirit of Girl Scouting at Epcot.[123]
 Cincinnati Museum Center held a day time and over night event to celebrate in partnership with the Girl Scouts of Western Ohio, who Ohio designed an exhibit, which was on display for free until May 13, 2012. The exhibit displays old uniforms, literature and discussed the role of the Girl Scouts for the last 100 years.[124]
 GSUSA made a new cookie called Savannah Smiles to commemorate the anniversary.[citation needed]
 The Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas hosted the Girl Scouts national exhibition at the 2012 State Fair of Texas in the historic Hall of State. At the State Fair of Texas, visitors were able to indulge on a Fried Samoa, be part of a virtual campfire, walk through a life - sized cookie box and see a replica of Juliette Gordon Low's house.[citation needed]
 In Savannah, Georgia where Girl Scouting was founded, they hosted a ""Party in the Park"" in Forsyth Park where there was a Centennial Honor Guard consisting of girls wearing vintage uniforms from the Girl Scout First Headquarters. The uniforms were;
1912 (replica)
1914
1928
1940s
1960s
1970s
1980s
and the current.[citation needed]
 The city of Savannah closed part of the Talmadge Bridge so girls could walk the bridge and ""Bridge to the next century.""
Savannah also had a ""Sunrise Service"" with the CEO, Anna Maria Chavez.[125] The Honor guard from the park carried the Eternal Flame.[citation needed]
 The city of Savannah dedicated their annual ""Georgia Day"" to Juliette.[citation needed]
 Camp Fire Girls was founded in 1910, two years prior to the Girl Scouts, by some of the creators of the Boy Scouts of America.[126] In 1975, the group became co-educational and soon afterwards changed its name to ""Camp Fire Boys and Girls"". The name was changed to Camp Fire USA in 2001 and to Camp Fire in 2012. As of 2009, the group has a membership of about 750,000.[127]
 Various religions have their own youth clubs such as Missionettes (now Mpact Girls) for the Assemblies of God. Little Flowers Girls' Club is a Catholic-focused girls club.[128] GEMS Girls' Clubs is a non-denominational group with a Calvinist/Reformed background. Pioneer Girls started as a Methodist group but is non-denominational.[citation needed]
 One youth group explicitly set up as a Christian alternative to the Girl Scouts is the American Heritage Girls (AHG), started in 1995 in West Chester, Ohio, by a group of parents upset with available female Scouting organizations.[129] AHG is a Christian organization that states that it is ""a nonprofit organization dedicated to the mission of building women of integrity through service to God, family, community and country.""[90] As of 2011 it claims a membership (adult and youth) of over 14,000.[130]

GiveIndia	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiveIndia	"GiveIndia is a non profit organisation in India. It is an online donation platform and aims to channel and provide resources to credible non-governmental organisations across India.[1] As a web portal, it helps raise funds and contributions from individuals across India and the world and then disburses these donations to credible Indian NGOs.
 After a rigorous  and thorough document based due diligence, supplemented by a visit or a strong reference, GiveIndia lists NGOs on its website. As of April 2011, GiveIndia has selected over 270 charitable organisations that are recommended on its website after reviewing more than 3,000 nonprofit organisations from all over India. GiveIndia works across ten causes and lists charities ranging from charity for children to charity for education, health, employment, elderly, disability, human rights, environment, youth and women's empowerment. 
GiveIndia also lets its donors know where exactly their donation was used and also give them a proof of it through a feedback report.[2] Every feedback report contains the details of the beneficiaries who were benefited from each donation. GiveInida also issues an instant e-tax receipt upon making a donation. The donations are either 80G (50% tax exempt) or 35AC (100% tax exempt). GiveIndia has one of the lowest costs of fundraising in India.[3] GiveIndia ensures that at least 90% of every donation reaches the organisation that is donated to (as against the average of 60% for the NGO sector).[4]
 GiveIndia was conceived in 1999 by IIM-A graduate Venkat Krishnan. It is run and managed by a team of professionals. Venkat Krishnan wanted to create a credible link between people willing to donate and credible grass root NGOs which work for the poorest of the poor. GiveIndia was started with the mission to create a culture of giving in India.[5][6] Most of these NGOs do not have adequate systems in place to raise awareness about their causes and consequently have difficulty raising funds to support these causes.
 GiveIndia does not undertake any charitable functions directly. Instead it channels funds provided by donors to certified non-profit organisations across India. Non-profit organisations who wish to partner with GiveIndia need to satisfy a minimum set of conditions known as ""credibility alliance norms."" Among other criteria, organisations must have no political ties and at least fifty percent of their beneficiaries must be economically underprivileged. Donors visit GiveIndia website and donate online to their preferred Indian NGOs and the donations are then disbursed to those NGOs.
 GiveIndia was created to allow secure donation options for potential donors and provide them with access to over one hundred NGOs.[citation needed]
 As of April 2014, since GiveIndia's inception, over 2,00,000 donors across the globe have been involved in supporting 270 organisations through GiveIndia.[7] Over the last decade, they have channelled over Rs. 130 crores to more than 270 NGOs all over India, impacting over 1 million lives. From 2011-2012, the organisation channelled over $4.4 million to over 270 NGO's and over 91% of these funds were raised in India.[8]  They launched India's first ""online philanthropy marketplace"" (a website where people can donate to causes of their own choice) in September 2000.
GiveIndia introduced the concept of Marathon-based fundraising in India. . Though, it is not associated with marathons such as the Mumbai Marathon, it was the official charity partner to the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon (SCMM) and Vodafone Delhi Half Marathon (VDHM).
 GiveIndia mainly raises funds for NGOs through various channels such as payroll giving, retail giving, client services and other fund raising events.
 GiveIndia  launched an online Payroll giving program in 2004 through which employees of the organisation may pledge a certain portion of their monthly income towards charity every month.[9] These monthly contributions accumulate in an online account that GiveIndia creates for each employee. Employees can log into their online accounts and donate to an NGO or cause of their choice from the accumulated sum. The funds are channelled to the respective NGOs by GiveIndia every month.
 Organisations like Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Cadbury, Reliance, ITC, HDFC Bank, NDTV, STAR TV, ICICI Bank, BBC, KPMG, McKinsey & Company and several others are part of GiveIndia's Payroll Giving Family all over India.[10][11] The Payroll Giving program already has more than 30,000 donors across over 125 companies contributing over Rs. 8 crores per month, and is growing fast.[12]
 GiveIndia pioneered online donations in India in the year 2000 and was one of the first worldwide. GiveIndia has channeled over Rs 6 crores to various non-profit organisations through the Internet.
GiveIndia’s site is designed as a ""Philanthropy Exchange"" that allows donors to donate directly to any of the ""listed"" non-profit organisations.[13]
 GiveIndia has launched the First Givers Club (FGC) in 2010. Nitin Nohria, from Harvard Business School, was one of the keynote speakers in the first summit held by First Givers Club in 2010.[14] In the Annual summit in 2010, 100 high-net-worth individuals pledged to give money and time to charity.[15] In the Annual Summit in 2011, Azim Premji and Rakesh Jhunjhunwala were the key note speakers.[16] Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, an Indian investor and trader, pledged to give away 25% of his wealth during his lifetime.[17][18]
 GiveIndia offers individuals and organisations the option to raise funds for a cause they wish to promote personally.[19] Utilising the GiveIndia portal, individuals can create their own customised iGive page, send it out to friends, family and social networks. All funds raised are then channelled by GiveIndia to the individual or cause chosen.
 iGive ceased to exit from the financial year 2018-19.
 GiveIndia has been selective in identifying events to raise funds for charity. The traditional model of organising events results in more than 80 per cent of the resources raised being spent on the event itself. So by ""piggy backing"" existing events that are already planned, GiveIndia ensures that the cost of fundraising is less than 10%, to contribute more towards a cause.
 It was the official charity partner to the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon (SCMM)[20] & Vodafone Delhi Half Marathon (VDHM).GiveIndia hosted a unique event - Engagement Evening - on November 17, 2006 that spread knowledge about the philanthropy marketplace and also celebrated the listing of NGOs
 GiveIndia also plays a major role in organising the Joy of Giving Week, which is celebrated around the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2.  During this week, the organisation encourages NGOs, government organisations, educational institutions, as well as the general public to donate money, time, and other resources.[21]

 Recognition
 In August 2018 Power Brands awarded GiveIndia the Bharatiya Manavata Vikas Puraskar for being the “ISI mark” of Indian charities and NGOs -  working as the “de facto people's advocate” - thus ensuring a donation platform of unquestionable transparency and clarity, allowing  an individual  or group to support a cause of their choice in the most effective way possible.[22]
 GiveIndia retains a maximum of 9.1% when transacting through its online portal. The 9.1% retained by GiveIndia is to cover its costs of processing a donation, providing a tax receipt and feedback report, a technical platform to track donations, due diligence and other administrative costs.[23]"
"The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria"	"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Global_Fund_to_Fight_AIDS,_Tuberculosis_and_Malaria"	"The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (or simply the Global Fund) is an international financing and partnership organization that aims to “attract, leverage and invest additional resources to end the epidemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria to support attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations.”[1] The international organization maintains its secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland.[2] The organization began operations in January 2002.[2] Microsoft founder Bill Gates was one of the first private foundations among many bilateral donors to provide seed money for the partnership.[3]
 The Global Fund is the world's largest financier of AIDS, TB, and malaria prevention, treatment, and care programs.[4] As of June 2019, the organization had disbursed more than US$41.6 billion to support these programs.[5] According to the organization, in 2017 it financed the distribution of 197 million insecticide-treated nets to combat malaria, provided anti-tuberculosis treatment for 5 million people, supported 17.5 million people on antiretroviral therapy for AIDS, and since its founding saved 27 million lives worldwide.[6]
 The Global Fund is a financing mechanism rather than an implementing agency. Programs are implemented by in-country partners such as ministries of health, while the Global Fund secretariat, whose staff only have an office in Geneva, monitor the programs. Implementation is overseen by Country Coordinating Mechanisms, country-level committees consisting of in-country stakeholders that need to include, according to Global Fund requirements, a broad spectrum of representatives from government, NGOs, faith-based organizations, the private sector, and people living with the diseases. This system has kept the Global Fund secretariat smaller than other international bureaucracies. The model has also raised concerns about conflict of interest, as some of the stakeholders represented on the Country Coordinating Mechanisms may also receive money from the Global Fund, either as grant recipients, sub-recipients, private persons (e.g. for travel or participation at seminars) or contractors.
 At the end of the 20th century, international political will to improve coordinated efforts to fight the world's deadliest infectious diseases began to materialize. Through various multilateral fora, consensus around creating a new international financial vehicle to combat these diseases emerged. In this context the World Health Organization called for a ""Massive Attack on Diseases of Poverty"" in December 1999. The original concept suggested tackling “malaria, tuberculosis, unsafe pregnancy, AIDS, diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory infections and measles.”[7] This list would steadily narrow to only include the three diseases the Global Fund fights today: HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria.[8][9][10]
 In April 2001, in Abuja, Nigeria at a summit of African leaders, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan made the first explicit public call by a highly visible global leader for this new funding mechanism, proposing ""the creation of a Global Fund, dedicated to the battle against HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.""[11] Secretary General Annan made the first contribution to the Global Fund in 2001. Having just been named the recipient of the 2001 Philadelphia Liberty Medal, Annan announced he would donate his US$100,000 award to the Global Fund ""war chest"" he had just proposed creating.[12] In June 2001 the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the creation of a global fund to fight HIV/AIDS.[13]
 The G8 formally endorsed the call for the creation of the Global Fund at its summit in July 2001 in Genoa, Italy, although pledges were significantly lower than the US$7 billion to US$10 billion annually Kofi Annan insisted was needed.[14] According to the G8's final communique, “At Okinawa last year, we pledged to make a quantum leap in the fight against infectious diseases and to break the vicious cycle between disease and poverty. To meet that commitment and to respond to the appeal of the UN General Assembly, we have launched with the UN Secretary-General a new Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. We are determined to make the Fund operational before the end of the year. We have committed $1.3 billion. The Fund will be a public-private partnership and we call on other countries, the private sector, foundations, and academic institutions to join with their own contributions - financially, in kind and through shared expertise.”[15]
 The Global Fund's initial 18-member policy-setting board held its first meeting in January 2002, and issued its first call for proposals.[16][17] The first secretariat was established in January 2002 with Paul Ehmer serving as team leader, soon replaced by Anders Nordstrom of Sweden who became the organization's interim executive director. By the time the Global Fund Secretariat became operational, the organization had received US$1.9 billion in pledges.
 In March 2002, a panel of international public health experts was named to begin reviewing project proposals that same month. In April 2002, the Global Fund awarded its first batch of grants – worth US$378 million – to fight the three diseases in 31 countries.[18]
 Since the Global Fund was created in 2002, public sector contributions have constituted 95 percent of all financing raised; the remaining 5 percent comes from the private sector or other financing initiatives such as Product Red.[19] The Global Fund states that from 2002 to July 2019, more than 60 donor governments pledged a total of US$51.2 billion and paid US$45.8 billion.[20] From 2001 through 2018, the largest contributor by far has been the United States, followed by France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan.[20][21] The donor nations with the largest percent of gross national income contributed to the fund from 2008 through 2010 were Sweden, Norway, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Spain.[citation needed]
 The Global Fund typically raises and spends funds during three-year ""replenishment"" fund-raising periods. Its first replenishment was launched in 2005, the second in 2007, the third in 2010, the fourth in 2013, and the fifth in 2016.[22]
 Alarms were raised prior to the third replenishment meeting in October 2010 about a looming deficit in funding, which would have led to people undergoing ARV treatment losing access, increasing the chance of them becoming resistant to treatment. UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibé dubbed the scenario of a funding deficit an ""HIV Nightmare"".[23] The Global Fund stated it needed at least US$20 billion for the third replenishment (covering programs 2011-2013), and US$13 billion just to ""allow for the continuation of funding of existing programs.""[24] Ultimately, US$11.8 billion was mobilized at the third replenishment meeting, with the United States being the largest contributor - followed by France, Germany, and Japan. The Global Fund stated the US$1.2 billion lack in funding would ""lead to difficult decisions in the next three years that could slow down the effort to beat the three diseases.""[25]
 In November 2011, the organization's board cancelled all new grants for 2012, only having enough money to support existing grants.[26] However, following the Global Fund's May 2012 board meeting, it announced that an additional US$1.6 billion would be available in the 2012-2014 period for investment in programs.[27]
 In December 2013, the fourth replenishment meeting was held in Washington D.C. USD 12 billion was pledged in contributions from 25 countries, as well as the European Commission, private foundations, corporations, and faith-based organizations for the 2014–2016 period.[28] It was the largest amount ever committed to fighting the three diseases.[29]
 The fifth replenishment meeting took place September 2016 in Montreal, Canada, and was hosted by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Donors pledged US$12.9 billion (at 2016 exchange rates) for the 2017-2019 period.[30]
 France and French President Emmanuel Macron will host the sixth replenishment meeting in 2019 for the 2020-2022 period.[31]
 Richard Feachem was named the Global Fund's first executive director in April 2002[32] and faced early criticism from activists for stating the Global Fund has ""plenty"" of money to start.[33]
 Feachem served from July 2002 through March 2007. Dr. Michel Kazatchkine was then selected as executive director over the Global Fund's architect, David Nabarro, even though Nabarro was “considered the strongest of three shortlisted candidates to head the Global Fund ... A selection committee has evaluated the three nominees' qualifications and ranked ‘Nabarro first, Kazatchkine second and (Alex) Cotinho third,’ according to a Fund source.”[34]
 In September 2011, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation called for Kazatchkine's resignation in the wake of isolated yet unprecedented reports of ""waste, fraud, and corruption"" in order that ""reforms may begin in earnest"".[35] In January 2012, Kazatchkine ultimately declared his resignation, following the decision made by the Global Fund board in November 2011 to appoint a general manager, leaving Kazatchkine's role to that of chief fund-raiser and public advocate.[36] Communications later disclosed by the United States government stated that Kazatchkine's performance was deemed unsatisfactory by the Global Fund board, notably in relation to the funding of activities related to the First Lady of France at the time, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy.[37]
 Following Kazatchkine's resignation, the Global Fund announced the appointment of Gabriel Jaramillo, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Sovereign Bank, to the newly created position of general manager. Jaramillo, who had retired one year earlier, had since served as a Special Advisor to the Office of the Special Envoy for Malaria of the Secretary General of the United Nations, and was a member of the high-level independent panel that looked at the Global Fund's fiduciary controls and oversight mechanisms. Jaramillo reorganized and reduced Global Fund staff in response to the previous year's critics of the Global Fund.[38]
 Dr. Mark R. Dybul was appointed executive director in November 2012.[39] He previously served as the United States Global AIDS Coordinator, leading the implementation of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) from 2006 to 2009. Dybul ended his appointment in 2017.
 A nominating process to find a successor to Dybul ran into trouble in 2017 because nominees had spoken out against Donald Trump as a candidate for president of the United States.[40] The Global Fund board named Global Fund Chief of Staff Marijke Wijnroks of the Netherlands as interim executive director while the nominating process restarted.[41]
 The Global Fund board selected banker  Peter Sands as executive director in 2017.[42] He assumed the role in 2018.
 The Global Fund was formed as an independent, non-profit foundation under Swiss law and hosted by the World Health Organization in January 2002.[43] In January 2009, the organization became an administratively autonomous organization, terminating its administrative services agreement with the World Health Organization.[44]
 The initial objective of the Global Fund — to provide funding to countries on the basis of performance — was supposed to make it different from other international agencies at the time of its inception. Other organizations may have staff that assist with the implementation of grants. However, the Global Fund's five-year evaluation in 2009 concluded that without a standing body of technical staff, the Global Fund is not able to ascertain the actual results of its projects.[citation needed] It has therefore tended to look at disbursements or the purchase of inputs as performance.[citation needed] It also became apparent shortly after the organization opened that a pure funding mechanism could not work on its own, and it began relying on other agencies – notably the World Health Organization – to support countries in designing and drafting their applications and in supporting implementation.[citation needed] The United Nations Development Programme, in particular, bears responsibility for supporting Global Fund-financed projects in a number of countries.[citation needed] As a result, the organization is most accurately described as a financial supplement to the existing global health architecture rather than as a separate approach.
 The Global Fund Secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland, employs about 700 staff.[45] There are neither offices nor staff based in other countries.[46]
 In 2013, the Global Fund adopted a new way of distributing its funds in countries to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.[47] Under this funding model, eligible countries receive an allocation of money every three years for possible use during same the three-year period.[48] The total amount of all allocations across all countries depends on the amount contributed by governments and other donors through the ""replenishment"" fundraising during the same three-year period.[49] The countries, through their “country coordinating mechanism” committees, submit applications outlining how they'll use the allocation.[50] The committees name entities, called “principal recipients,” to carry about programs within their respective countries.[51] An independent ""technical review panel"" reviews the applications.[52] Once the applications are approved, the Global Fund provides funding to the principal recipients based on achievement toward agreed indicators and actual expenses.[53] Performance and expenses are periodically reviewed by a “local fund agent,” which in most countries is an international financial audit company.[54]
 In January 2011, the Associated Press reported vast corruption in some programs financed by the Global Fund, citing findings of the Global Fund Office of the Inspector General – an auditing unit independent from the Global Fund Secretariat – that up to two-thirds of funds in some of the reviewed grants were lost to fraud.[55] The Office of the Inspector General report showed that systematic fraud patterns had been used across countries.[55] The Global Fund responded to the story with a news release, stating, ""The Global Fund has zero tolerance for corruption and actively seeks to uncover any evidence of misuse of its funds. It deploys some of the most rigorous procedures to detect fraud and fight corruption of any organization financing development.""[56]
 After the Associated Press story, a number of op-eds, including one by Michael Gerson published in the Washington Post in February 2011, sought to put the controversy surrounding the misuse of Global Fund grants in perspective. Gerson stated, ""The two-thirds figure applies to one element of one country's grant - the single most extreme example in the world. Investigations are ongoing, but the $34 million in fraud that has been exposed represents about three-tenths of 1 percent of the money the fund has distributed. The targeting of these particular cases was not random; they were the most obviously problematic, not the most typical.""[57]
 Global Fund spokesman Jon Liden told the Associated Press, ""The messenger is being shot to some extent. We would contend that we do not have any corruption problems that are significantly different in scale or nature to any other international financing institution.""[55] Subsequent Global Fund statements omitted any reference to other agencies.[citation needed]
 Previous reviews of grants and the Global Fund had shown substantial misconduct in some programs, lack of adequate risk management, and operational inefficiency of the Global Fund.[58] Cases of corruption had also been found in several African countries such as Mali, Mauritania, Djibouti, and Zambia.[55]
 Sweden, the Global Fund's 11th-biggest contributor at the time (2011), suspended its US$85 million annual donation until the corruption problems were resolved.[55] Germany, the third-biggest contributor at the time, also blocked any financing until a special investigation was complete.[59] Funding was eventually restored.
 Other cases of abuse of funds, corruption and mismanagement in a series of grants forced the Global Fund to suspend or terminate the grants after such dealings became publicly known in Uganda, Zimbabwe, Philippines, and Ukraine.[citation needed]
 In February 2011, the Financial Times reported that the Global Fund board failed to act previously on concerns over accountability including on the conclusion of an external evaluation in 2009 that criticized the organization's weak procurement practices.[60] Warnings of inadequate controls had also been reported periodically.[61] The Financial Times also reported that its own review found that neither Global Fund staff nor “local fund agents” (the entities entrusted with audit-like tasks at the country level) had noticed the deficiencies reported by the inspector general.[60]
 In 2012, the Global Fund hired a chief risk officer, Cees Klumper.[62] After pushing countries to reclaim stolen funds from the parties responsible and recovering only about half, the organization began in 2014 as a last resort reducing future grants by twice the amount of misappropriated funds.[63] As of February 2016, this resulted in US$14.8 million of reductions (collectively) for Bangladesh, Guatemala, Nigeria and Sri Lanka.[citation needed][needs update]"
GlobalGiving	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlobalGiving	"GlobalGiving is 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in the United States that provides a global crowdfunding platform for grassroots charitable projects.[3] Since 2002, more than 800,000 donors on GlobalGiving have raised more than $340 million to support more than 20,000 projects in 170 countries.[4]
 Before founding GlobalGiving, Mari Kuraishi and Dennis Whittle were heads of strategy and innovation at the World Bank. While in that post, they created the first-ever Innovation Marketplace for Bank staff in 1998, an internal competition in which Bank employees pitched their own ideas for fighting poverty worldwide. The winners received grants to develop their ideas.[citation needed]
 In 2000, they took the concept and competition to the outside world. The Development Marketplace enabled any social entrepreneur to compete for Bank funds.[5] The program was extremely successful — finalists from all over the world gathered in Washington, D.C., and $5 million was awarded to the 44 most innovative projects.
 Based on the Marketplaces' success, Mari and Dennis created an Internet-based platform to facilitate a broader range of social and economic investments in developing countries. In October 2000, they left the World Bank and on February 14, 2002, GlobalGiving (formerly DevelopmentSpace) was launched.
 Major funding for the launch and early stages was provided by the Omidyar Network, the Skoll Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and the Sall Foundation.[6] GlobalGiving was launched as a collaboration between the GlobalGiving Foundation and ManyFutures, Inc. In December 2008, ManyFutures became a formal subsidiary of the GlobalGiving Foundation, and all operations were placed under direct foundation management.[7]
 The GlobalGiving Foundation is a US-based non-profit organization that individuals and companies can donate to through the website globalgiving.org. It is supported by a network of implementing, corporate and institutional partners.[8]
 Potential donors can browse and select from a wide offering of projects that are organized by geography or by themes such as health care, the environment and education.[9] A donor can contribute any amount using a credit/debit card, check, PayPal, Apple Pay, stock transfer, DAF, or M-Pesa. Donors can purchase gift cards which recipients can redeem in support of a project of their choosing.[10]
 GlobalGiving funds itself by retaining a 5-12% nonprofit support fee plus a 3% third-party processing fee for each donation.[11] The nonprofit support fee covers the cost of providing support and training to nonprofits, conducting rigorous due diligence on organizations, and conducting field visits. GlobalGiving's administrative overhead is 3.0%.[12]
 Companies can also use the GlobalGiving platform to allow their employees, customers, partners, or foundation entities to donate directly to grassroots social and economic development projects around the world.[13]
 GlobalGiving as a web-based fundraising platform is fundamentally different from the World Bank Development Marketplace because it is based on social networks and real-time feedback between donors and grassroots social entrepreneurs or ""project leaders."" Each organization pitches one or more development projects to prospective donors on the website. The funding decision for each project is crowd-sourced to the public, rather than determined by a team of experts, as in the Development Marketplace. However, in practice, organizations that promote themselves through email and social media campaigns vastly improve their fundraising potential. Each project depends on evangelists (people who spread good news) to flourish. The funding and project update history for each project is public and acts as a form of reputation system for the organization implementing the project.
 In response to natural disasters and humanitarian crises, GlobalGiving regularly launches relief funds to support nonprofits helping those in need. The Disaster Recovery Network at GlobalGiving[14] deploys a ""model of effective, community-led relief and recovery through locally focused grants, advocacy, and training programs."" GlobalGiving's former Chief Program Officer describes the approach as:
 GlobalGiving's community of nonprofits, donors, and companies has funded relief work in response to a wide range of disasters, including  Hurricane Maria in 2017, the Nepal earthquake in 2015, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011, and the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis, among others.[14] GlobalGiving is regularly recommended by USAID's Center for International Disaster Information to donors looking to support disaster relief efforts.[15][16][17][18][19]
 GlobalGiving runs a vetting program for nonprofits participating in its community. Nonprofits are judged on characteristics such as transparency, accountability, financials, and compliance with local regulations and international philanthropic guidelines. The vetting also factors in GlobalGiving-specific criteria such as engagement with the GlobalGiving community, ability to crowdfund on the platform, and ability to manage the programs fundraising on the platform. Through a rewards program called GG Rewards, GlobalGiving ranks nonprofits as Partners, Leaders, or Superstars based primarily on engagement with the GlobalGiving community and a demonstrated commitment to effectiveness. GG Rewards also offers badges like ""Site Visit Verified"", ""Effective Nonprofit"", and ""Project of the Month"".[20][21][22] The ratings themselves but not the supporting data are visible on nonprofits' profiles on the site. Nonprofits can see details of their own GG Rewards in their account's dashboard. GG Rewards ratings are also posted on nonprofits' Charity Navigator profiles. As of November 2017, approximately 53% of GlobalGiving partner nonprofits were rated Partner,[23] 22% were rated Leader,[24] and 24% were rated Superstar.[25] Approximately 27% had earned the Site Visit Verified badge, and 19% had earned the Effective Nonprofit badge.[25]
 GlobalGiving earned Charity Navigator's highest rating of four stars in the latest ratings published by the charity evaluator.[26] The Better Business Bureau's 2015 review states that GlobalGiving meets all of its charity accreditation standards.[27]"
Global Greengrants Fund	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Greengrants_Fund	"Global Greengrants Fund is a charitable foundation that makes small grants (typically $500 to $5,000) to grassroots environmental causes around the world.  These funds are used to support community-based groups outside the United States and Western Europe working on issues of environmental justice, sustainability, and conservation.  Since its establishment in 1993, Global Greengrants Fund has made over 5,000 grants in 129 countries, giving a total of over $20 million.[1]
 To “make small grants (typically $500 to $5,000) to grassroots groups around the world working to help people protect the environment, live sustainably, preserve biodiversity, and gain a voice in their own future."" [2]
 Greengrants focuses its resources in seven major issue areas:  biodiversity, climate change, energy, indigenous peoples, sustenance, water, and women.[3]
 Greengrants launched a designated climate fund in June 2010 in partnership with 1% for the Planet.  Through this program, groups will receive $500–5,000 to
 Greengrants seeks to bridge the gap between those who can offer financial support and grassroots groups in developing countries that can make effective use of that support.  To identify prospective grantees, Greengrants uses a volunteer network of advisors - experts in their fields who are knowledgeable about the pressing issues in their regions and able to identify grassroots groups working on these issues.  Through this global network, the organization is able to grant money to groups working in local communities that otherwise would have little or no access to funding. This network keeps overhead costs low, while ensuring that grant dollars are reaching those who the organization feels are most in need and are best positioned to effect real change.
 Each board develops a grantmaking strategy to fit the regional context and the advisors’ experiences. The advisors identify appropriate moments for strategic grants to grassroots groups. Global Greengrants Fund has supported a wide array of projects and groups over the years, from organic agriculture in India, to securing land rights for indigenous peoples in Brazil, to fighting dams in Mozambique.
 Greengrants currently has regional advisory boards in the Andes, Central America, China, East Africa, India, the Pacific Islands, Russia, Southern Africa, the Southern Cone of South America, and West Africa. These boards are composed of volunteers from a variety of fields and coordinated by part-time staff members in each region.
 Additionally, Greengrants has developed a partnership of locally constituted and locally governed organizations in Brazil (Center for Socio-Environmental Support), Mexico (Solidarity in Action Fund), Southeast Asia (The Samdhana Institute), The Netherlands (Both ENDS), and Canada (Small Change Fund). Together, these organizations make up the Greengrants Alliance of Funds. The members of the Alliance operate much like the other the advisory boards, while also raising their own resources to increase support for grassroots groups in their respective regions.
 Also affiliated with Greengrants is a group of Global Advisors that supplements the work of its regional boards. They include Earth Island Institute, Friends of the Earth International, International Rivers Network, Pesticide Action Network, and Rainforest Action Network. In addition, an International Financial Institutions (IFI) Advisory Board identifies grassroots groups working to influence trends in international lending and finance, helping citizens gain a voice in decisions about development programs, dams, public works and other large-scale infrastructure projects.
 In 2009, with the help of several organizations supported in part by small grants from Greengrants, the National Coalition on Mining succeeded in pressuring the Ghanaian government to ban mining in protected forest reserves.
 In 2008, pressure  from groups including the Indigenous Council of Roraima and the National Committee in Defense of Raposa Serra do Sol Indigenous Land (both of which are supported by Greengrants and their partner, the Center of Socio-Environmental Support (CASA) in Brazil) concluded a 20-year legal struggle to secure their traditional lands in the Raposa Serra do Sol reserve in the northern Brazilian state of Roraima.
 Using only the seven grants totaling $30,400 made to them between 2005 and 2009 by Greengrants, the Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug (KI) indigenous community in northern Ontario won the protection of their lands from exploitation by the Toronto-based Platinex, Inc.  The proposed project would have threatened the health and livelihood of the indigenous community, which lies 125 miles from the nearest road, in the Boreal Forest of Northern Ontario.
 Global Greengrants Fund received a four out of four star rating on Charity Navigator, an independent organization that rates non-profits.  They received four stars on both efficiency and capacity.
 Greengrants has been chosen by the Aveda Corporation as their global partner for Aveda's annual Earth month campaign.[4] They work together to support clean water projects in communities where Aveda sources their ingredients.  In 2007, $700,000 was raised though candle sales and customer donations from salons and spas. With this money, 186 projects were funded in 15 countries such as India, Brazil and Bulgaria.[5]
 To date, 27 Greengrants grantees and advisors have been awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize, considered the ""Nobel Prize of environmental activism."" Notably, in 2009, Wanze Eduards and S. Hugo Jabini of Suriname ""successfully organized their communities against logging on their traditional lands, ultimately leading to a landmark ruling for indigenous and tribal peoples throughout the Americas to control resource exploitation in their territories."".[6] Other grantees have received the Condé Nast Traveler Environment Award; the J. Paul Getty Wildlife Conservation Prize; the Sting and Trudie Styler Award for Human Rights and the Environment; and the Reebok Human Rights Award, among others."
Global Village Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Village_Foundation	"The Global Village Foundation (GVF) is a non-profit charitable organization which provides education and health care for children and rural villagers in Vietnam[1] and some other countries of Asia. Established in 1999 by author and humanitarian Le Ly Hayslip,[2] it is based in the United States.
 In 1986, coming back to Vietnam after a 16-year absence, Hayslip was deeply affected by the poor living conditions and devastation there. Deciding to make a difference, she initially set up the East Meets West Foundation and later, Global Village Foundation for helping to rebuild and reconstruct her motherland and contributing to the peaceful dialogue between the United States and Vietnam.
 The main fields of the foundation operations include:
 The 1993 film Heaven & Earth, directed by Oliver Stone, was based on the memoir When Heaven and Earth Changed Places by Global Village Foundation initiator Le Ly Hayslip, who had a cameo appearance in the film.
 The story of Le Ly Hayslip's humanitarian journey and the activities of GVF in Vietnam were also portrayed in the award-winning DVD documentary, From War to Peace and Beyond.
 In 1995, Le Ly Hayslip was honored by the California State Assembly award in Sacramento for her humanitarian and reconciliation activities.

Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_and_Betty_Moore_Foundation	"The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation is an American foundation established by  Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore and his wife Betty I. Moore in September 2000[1] to support scientific discovery, environmental conservation,  patient care improvements and preservation of the character of the Bay Area.
 As outlined in the Statement of Founder's Intent,[2] the foundation's aim is to tackle large, important issues at a scale where it can achieve significant and measurable impacts."
Grassroots Business Fund	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots_Business_Fund	"The Grassroots Business Fund is a non-profit based in Washington, DC. It has field offices in Kenya, Peru, and India.[1] Their mission is to build and support high-impact enterprises that provide sustainable economic opportunities to thousands of people at the base of the economic pyramid. These enterprises are grassroots business organizations in developing countries that empower large numbers of the poor as producers of income-generating commodities and products, as consumers of affordable goods and services, and as independent entrepreneurs. GBF actively supports enterprises throughout Latin America, Africa, India, and Southeast Asia.[2]
 The origins of GBF can be traced back as far as 2000 at the International Finance Corporation (IFC), when Harold Rosen founded the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) department, a joint IFC/World Bank department. In 2004, Mr. Rosen started the Grassroots Business Initiatives (GBI), which aimed to build sustainable, non-financial intermediaries that would empower large numbers of High Impact Businesses and individual producers, consumers, and entrepreneurs. GBI worked directly with High Impact Businesses to strengthen their business performance, scale up their operations, and improve their sustainability. From 2004 to 2007, GBI implemented over 40 technical assistance projects and investments impacting the lives of over 3.4 million direct and indirect beneficiaries at the bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid.[3]
 In 2008, the GBI department was transformed into an independent organization called the Grassroots Business Fund (GBF).[4]
 Harold Rosen is Executive Director of the Grassroots Business Fund. Harold spent 30 years managing IFC's emerging markets investments and leading IFC into new geographic areas and sectors, such as microfinance, technical assistance and SMEs.[5] He founded the World Bank's group SME department, and then spun this off into Grassroots Business Fund, an independent organization funded by IFC and a number of others.[6]
 GBF makes equity, quasi-equity, and debt investments. Quasi-equity investments are debt instruments with embedded equity features, such as convertible loans, royalty-based loans, and warrants. GBF targets investments between  $750,000 to $2,500,000 and has an average investment horizon of 5 to 7 years. GBF can also provide short-term working capital loans to export-oriented businesses between $40,000 and $150,000 through a separate facility (SME Export Facility).[7] To date, GBF has invested $7 million invested in 26 businesses across 10 countries.[8] Included in these was Novica in 2009. Novica enables artisans to sell their goods worldwide.
 During 2009, Keystone supported GBF to make a significant investment in its own evaluation systems, captured in what they believe is a 'best in class' framework called Impact Planning, Assessment and Learning (iPAL) framework.[9]
 GBF's innovative monitoring and evaluation framework called, Impact Planning, Assessment, and Learning (iPAL), which allows GBF and its clients to better respond to results and experiences of their beneficiaries. iPAL effectively measures, analyzes and communicates the poverty alleviation impact of its clients, not only for internal purposes, but more importantly to guide and support its clients’ social mission. In doing so, GBF focuses on capturing impact data from its clients rather than just narrative reports. GBF's initial focus is determining metrics that allow its clients to set and manage objectives, improve impacts, and strengthen management systems. GBF integrates its iPAL framework throughout the investment life cycle and ensures that iPAL is integrated into its clients’ business processes. GBF tailors iPAL to each GBO, which includes basic reporting on activities and outputs, a survey-based review of beneficiary impacts, a social return on investment calculation, and client feedback[10]
 The Group of 20 and Ashoka's Changemakers, with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, have launched an online competition to find the best models worldwide for public-private partnerships that catalyze finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The G-20 SME Finance Challenge, the first ever competition launched by the G-20, is a unique financial inclusion effort aimed at giving small entrepreneurs a chance to grow their businesses[11]
 GBF was named one of 14 winners out of over 350 submitted proposals. The winners receive funding and GBF's executive director, Harold Rosen, accepted an invitation to the November 2010 G-20 Summit in South Korea. For this event, he will join the leaders from around the world to discuss SME's role in poverty alleviation, including GBF's innovate solutions to some of the most challenging problems facing the world today."
Greenpeace	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpeace	"Greenpeace is a non-governmental[3] environmental organization with offices in over 39 countries and an international coordinating body in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.[4] Greenpeace was founded in 1971 by Irving Stowe and Dorothy Stowe, Canadian and US ex-pat environmental activists. Greenpeace states its goal is to ""ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity""[5] and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues. It uses direct action, lobbying, research, and ecotage[6] to achieve its goals. The global organization does not accept funding from governments, corporations, or political parties, relying on three million individual supporters and foundation grants.[7][8] Greenpeace has a general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council[9] and is a founding member[10] of the INGO Accountability Charter, an international non-governmental organization that intends to foster accountability and transparency of non-governmental organizations.
 Greenpeace is known for its direct actions and has been described[by whom?] as the most visible environmental organization in the world.[11][12] Greenpeace has raised environmental issues to public knowledge,[13][14][15] and influenced both the private and the public sector.[16][17] Greenpeace has also been a source of controversy;[18] its motives and methods (some of the latter being illegal) have received criticism,[19][20] including an open letter from more than 100 Nobel laureates urging Greenpeace to end its campaign against genetically modified organisms (GMOs).[21] The organization's direct actions have sparked legal actions against Greenpeace activists,[22][23] such as fines and suspended sentences for destroying a test plot of genetically modified wheat[24][25][26] and damaging the Nazca Lines, a UN World Heritage site in Peru.[27]
 In the late 1960s, the U.S. had plans for an underground nuclear weapon test in the tectonically unstable island of Amchitka in Alaska. Because of the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the plans raised some concerns of the test triggering earthquakes and causing a tsunami. A 1969 demonstration of 7,000[28] people blocked the Peace Arch Border Crossing between British Columbia and Washington,[29] carrying signs reading ""Don't Make A Wave. It's Your Fault If Our Fault Goes"".[30] The protests did not stop the U.S. from detonating the bomb.[30]
 While no earthquake or tsunami followed the test, the opposition grew when the U.S. announced they would detonate a bomb five times more powerful than the first one. Among the opponents were Jim Bohlen, a veteran who had served in the U.S. Navy, and Irving Stowe and Dorothy Stowe, who had recently become Quakers. They were frustrated by the lack of action by the Sierra Club Canada, which they were members of.[30] From Irving Stowe, Jim Bohlen learned of a form of passive resistance, ""bearing witness"", where objectionable activity is protested simply by mere presence.[30] Jim Bohlen's wife Marie came up with the idea to sail to Amchitka, inspired by the anti-nuclear voyages of Albert Bigelow in 1958. The idea ended up in the press and was linked to The Sierra Club.[30] The Sierra Club did not like this connection and in 1970 The Don't Make a Wave Committee was established for the protest. Early meetings were held in the Shaughnessy home of Robert Hunter and his wife Bobbi Hunter. Subsequently, the Stowe home at 2775 Courtenay Street (Vancouver) became the headquarters.[31] As Rex Weyler put it in his chronology, Greenpeace, in 1969, Irving and Dorothy Stowe's ""quiet home on Courtenay Street would soon become a hub of monumental, global significance"". Some of the first Greenpeace meetings were held there. The first office was opened in a backroom, storefront on Cypress and West Broadway SE corner in Kitsilano, Vancouver.[32] Within half a year Greenpeace would move in to share the upstairs office space with The Society Promoting Environmental Conservation at 4th and Maple in Kitsilano.[33]
 Irving Stowe arranged a benefit concert (supported by Joan Baez) that took place on 16 October 1970 at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver.[34] The concert created the financial basis for the first Greenpeace campaign.[35] Amchitka, the 1970 concert that launched Greenpeace was published by Greenpeace in November 2009 on CD and is also available as an mp3 download via the Amchitka concert website. Using the money raised with the concert, the Don't Make a Wave Committee chartered a ship, the Phyllis Cormack owned and sailed by John Cormack. The ship was renamed Greenpeace for the protest after a term coined by activist Bill Darnell.[30]
 In the autumn of 1971, the ship sailed towards Amchitka and faced the U.S. Coast Guard ship Confidence[30] which forced the activists to turn back. Because of this and the increasingly bad weather the crew decided to return to Canada only to find out that the news about their journey and reported support from the crew of the Confidence had generated sympathy for their protest.[30] After this Greenpeace tried to navigate to the test site with other vessels, until the U.S. detonated the bomb.[30] The nuclear test was criticized and the U.S. decided not to continue with their test plans at Amchitka.
 Environmental historian Frank Zelko dates the formation of the ""Don't Make a Wave Committee"" to 1969 and, according to Jim Bohlen, the group adopted the name ""Don't Make a Wave Committee"" on 28 November 1969.[36] According to the Greenpeace web site, The Don't Make a Wave Committee was established in 1970.[37] Certificate of incorporation of The Don't Make a Wave Committee dates the incorporation to the fifth of October, 1970.[38] Researcher Vanessa Timmer dates the official incorporation to 1971.[39] Greenpeace itself calls the protest voyage of 1971 as ""the beginning"".[40] According to Patrick Moore, who was an early member and has since distanced himself from Greenpeace, and Rex Weyler, the name of ""The Don't Make a Wave Committee"" was officially changed to Greenpeace Foundation in 1972.[38][41]
 Vanessa Timmer has referred to the early members as ""an unlikely group of loosely organized protestors"".[39] Frank Zelko has commented that ""unlike Friends of the Earth, for example, which sprung fully formed from the forehead of David Brower, Greenpeace developed in a more evolutionary manner. There was no single founder"".[42] Greenpeace itself says on its web page that ""there's a joke that in any bar in Vancouver, British Columbia, you can sit down next to someone who claims to have founded Greenpeace. In fact, there was no single founder: name, idea, spirit and tactics can all be said to have separate lineages"".[37] Patrick Moore has said that ""the truth is that Greenpeace was always a work in progress, not something definitively founded like a country or a company. Therefore there are a few shades of gray about who might lay claim to being a founder of Greenpeace.""[38] Early Greenpeace director Rex Weyler says on his homepage that the insiders of Greenpeace have debated about the founders since the mid-1970s.[43]
 The current Greenpeace web site lists the founders of The Don't Make a Wave Committee as Dorothy and Irving Stowe, Marie and Jim Bohlen, Ben and Dorothy Metcalfe, and Robert Hunter.[37] According to both Patrick Moore and an interview with Dorothy Stowe, Dorothy Metcalfe, Jim Bohlen and Robert Hunter, the founders of The Don't Make a Wave Committee were Paul Cote, Irving and Dorothy Stowe and Jim and Marie Bohlen.[38][44]
 Paul Watson, founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society maintains that he also was one of the founders of The Don't Make a Wave Committee and Greenpeace.[45] Greenpeace has stated that Watson was an influential early member, but not one of the founders of Greenpeace.[46] Watson has since accused Greenpeace of rewriting their history.[45]
 Because Patrick Moore was among the crew of the first protest voyage, Moore also considers himself one of the founders. Greenpeace claims that although Moore was a significant early member, he was not among the founders of Greenpeace.[44][47]
 After the office in the Stowe home, (and after the first concert fund-raiser) Greenpeace functions moved to other private homes and held public meetings weekly on Wednesday nights at the Kitsilano Neighborhood House before settling, in the autumn of 1974, in a small office shared with the SPEC environmental group at 2007 West 4th at Maple in Kitsilano. When the nuclear tests at Amchitka were over, Greenpeace moved its focus to the French atmospheric nuclear weapons testing at the Moruroa Atoll in French Polynesia. The young organization needed help for their protests and were contacted by David McTaggart, a former businessman living in New Zealand. In 1972 the yacht Vega, a 12.5-metre (41 ft) ketch owned by David McTaggart, was renamed Greenpeace III and sailed in an anti-nuclear protest into the exclusion zone at Moruroa to attempt to disrupt French nuclear testing. This voyage was sponsored and organized by the New Zealand branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.[48] The French Navy tried to stop the protest in several ways, including assaulting David McTaggart. McTaggart was supposedly beaten to the point that he lost sight in one of his eyes. However, one of McTaggart's crew members photographed the incident and went public. After the assault was publicized, France announced it would stop the atmospheric nuclear tests.[30]
 In the mid-1970s some Greenpeace members started an independent campaign, Project Ahab, against commercial whaling, since Irving Stowe was against Greenpeace focusing on other issues than nuclear weapons.[49] After Irving Stowe died in 1975, the Phyllis Cormack sailed from Vancouver to face Soviet whalers on the coast of California. Greenpeace activists disrupted the whaling by placing themselves between the harpoons and the whales, and footage of the protests spread across the world. Later in the 1970s, the organization widened its focus to include toxic waste and commercial seal hunting.[30]
 The ""Greenpeace Declaration of Interdependence"" was published by Greenpeace in the Greenpeace Chronicles (Winter 1976-77). This declaration was a condensation of a number of ecological manifestos Bob Hunter had written over the years.
 Greenpeace evolved from a group of Canadian and American protesters into a less conservative group of environmentalists who were more reflective of the counterculture and hippie youth movements of the 1960s and 1970s.[50] The social and cultural background from which Greenpeace emerged heralded a period of de-conditioning away from Old World antecedents and sought to develop new codes of social, environmental and political behavior.[51][52]
 In the mid-1970s independent groups using the name Greenpeace started springing up worldwide. By 1977, there were 15 to 20 Greenpeace groups around the world.[53] At the same time the Canadian Greenpeace office was heavily in debt. Disputes between offices over fund-raising and organizational direction split the global movement as the North American offices were reluctant to be under the authority of the Vancouver office and its president Patrick Moore.[53]
 After the incidents of Moruroa Atoll, David McTaggart had moved to France to battle in court with the French state and helped to develop the cooperation of European Greenpeace groups.[30] David McTaggart lobbied the Canadian Greenpeace Foundation to accept a new structure which would bring the scattered Greenpeace offices under the auspices of a single global organization. The European Greenpeace paid the debt of the Canadian Greenpeace office and on 14 October 1979, Greenpeace International came into existence.[39][53] Under the new structure, the local offices would contribute a percentage of their income to the international organization, which would take responsibility for setting the overall direction of the movement with each regional office having one vote.[53] Some Greenpeace groups, namely London Greenpeace (dissolved in 2001) and the US-based Greenpeace Foundation (still operational) however decided to remain independent from Greenpeace International.[54][55]
 Greenpeace consists of Greenpeace International (officially Stichting Greenpeace Council) based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and 26 regional offices operating in 55 countries.[56] The regional offices work largely autonomously under the supervision of Greenpeace International. The executive director of Greenpeace is elected by the board members of Greenpeace International. The current directors of Greenpeace International are Bunny McDiarmid and Jennifer Morgan and the current Chair of the Board is Ana Toni.[57][58] Greenpeace has a staff of 2,400[59] and 15,000 volunteers globally.[1]
 Each regional office is led by a regional executive director elected by the regional board of directors. The regional boards also appoint a trustee to The Greenpeace International Annual General Meeting, where the trustees elect or remove the board of directors of Greenpeace International. The role of the annual general meeting is also to discuss and decide the overall principles and strategically important issues for Greenpeace in collaboration with the trustees of regional offices and Greenpeace International board of directors.[60]
 Greenpeace receives its funding from individual supporters and foundations.[5][7] Greenpeace screens all major donations in order to ensure it does not receive unwanted donations.[61] The organization does not accept money from governments, intergovernmental organizations, political parties or corporations in order to avoid their influence.[5][7][61] However, Greenpeace does receive money from the National Postcode Lottery, the biggest government-sponsored lottery in the Netherlands
 
Donations from foundations which are funded by political parties or receive most of their funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations are rejected. Foundation donations are also rejected if the foundations attach unreasonable conditions, restrictions or constraints on Greenpeace activities or if the donation would compromise the independence and aims of Greenpeace.[61] Since in the mid-1990s the number of supporters started to decrease, Greenpeace pioneered the use of face-to-face fundraising where fundraisers actively seek new supporters at public places, subscribing them for a monthly direct debit donation.[62][63] In 2008, most of the €202.5 million received by the organization was donated by about 2.6 million regular supporters, mainly from Europe.[59] In 2014, the annual revenue of Greenpeace was reported to be about €300 million (US$400 million) although they lost about €4 million (US$5 million) in currency speculation that year.[64]  In September 2003, Public Interest Watch (PIW) complained to the Internal Revenue Service that Greenpeace USA tax returns were inaccurate and in violation of the law.[65][66] The IRS conducted an extensive review and concluded in December 2005 that Greenpeace USA continued to qualify for its tax-exempt status. In March 2006 The Wall Street Journal reported that PIW's ""federal tax filing, covering August 2003 to July 2004, stated that $120,000 of the $124,095 the group received in contributions during that period came from Exxon Mobil"".[67] In 2013, after the IRS performed a follow-up audit, which again was clean, and, following claims of politically motivated IRS audits of groups affiliated with the Tea Party Movement, Greenpeace U.S. Executive Director Phil Radford called for a Congressional investigation into all politically motivated audits – including those allegedly targeting the Tea Party Movement, the NAACP, and Greenpeace.[68]
 On its International website, Greenpeace defines its mission as the following:
 ""Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation, which uses non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems, and develop solutions for a green and peaceful future. 
Our goal is to create a world where all life on Earth can flourish. That means we work to:
- Stop the planet from warming beyond 1.5º to prevent the most catastrophic impacts of the climate breakdown.
- Protect biodiversity in all its forms.
- Slow the volume of hyper-consumption and learn to live within our means.
- Promote renewable energy as a solution that can power the world.
- Nurture peace, global disarmament and non-violence.""[citation needed]
 Greenpeace was one of the first parties to formulate a sustainable development scenario for climate change mitigation, which it did in 1993.[69] According to sociologists Marc Mormont and Christine Dasnoy, Greenpeace played a significant role in raising public awareness of global warming in the 1990s.[70] The organization has also focused on CFCs, because of both their global warming potential and their effect on the ozone layer. Greenpeace was one of the leading participants advocating early phase-out of ozone depleting substances in the Montreal Protocol.[16] In the early 1990s, Greenpeace developed a CFC-free refrigerator technology, ""Greenfreeze"" for mass production together with the refrigerator industry.[16] United Nations Environment Programme awarded Greenpeace for ""outstanding contributions to the protection of the Earth's ozone layer"" in 1997.[71] In 2011 two fifths of the world's total production of refrigerators were based on Greenfreeze technology, with over 600 million units in use.[16][72]
 Currently Greenpeace considers global warming to be the greatest environmental problem facing the Earth.[73] Greenpeace calls for global greenhouse gas emissions to peak in 2015 and to decrease as close to zero as possible by 2050. To reach these numbers, Greenpeace has called for the industrialized countries to cut their emissions at least 40% by 2020 (from 1990 levels) and to give substantial funding for developing countries to build a sustainable energy capacity, to adapt to the inevitable consequences of global warming, and to stop deforestation by 2020.[74] Together with EREC, Greenpeace has formulated a global energy scenario, ""Energy [R]evolution"", where 80% of the world's total energy is produced with renewables, and the emissions of the energy sector are decreased by over 80% of the 1990 levels by 2050.[75]
 Using direct action, Greenpeace has protested several times against coal by occupying coal power plants and blocking coal shipments and mining operations, in places such as New Zealand,[76] Svalbard,[77] Australia,[78] and the United Kingdom.[79] Greenpeace is also critical of extracting petroleum from oil sands and has used direct action to block operations at the Athabasca oil sands in Canada.[80][81]
 In October 2007, six Greenpeace protesters were arrested for breaking into the Kingsnorth power station, climbing the 200 metre smokestack, painting the name Gordon on the chimney, and causing an estimated £30,000 damage. At their subsequent trial they admitted trying to shut the station down, but argued that they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change from causing greater damage to property elsewhere around the world. Evidence was heard from David Cameron's environment adviser Zac Goldsmith, climate scientist James E. Hansen and an Inuit leader from Greenland, all saying that climate change was already seriously affecting life around the world. The six activists were acquitted. It was the first case where preventing property damage caused by climate change has been used as part of a ""lawful excuse"" defense in court.[82] Both The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian described the acquittal as embarrassment to the Brown Ministry.[83][84] In December 2008 The New York Times listed the acquittal in its annual list of the most influential ideas of the year.[85]
 As part of their stance on renewable energy commercialisation, Greenpeace have launched the ""Go Beyond Oil"" campaign.[86] The campaign is focused on slowing, and eventually ending, the world's consumption of oil; with activist activities taking place against companies that pursue oil drilling as a venture. Much of the activities of the ""Go Beyond Oil"" campaign have been focused on drilling for oil in the Arctic and areas affected by the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The activities of Greenpeace in the arctic have mainly involved the Edinburgh-based oil and gas exploration company, Cairn Energy; and range from protests at the Cairn Energy's headquarters[87] to scaling their oil rigs in an attempt to halt the drilling process.[88]
 The ""Go Beyond Oil"" campaign also involves applying political pressure on the governments who allow oil exploration in their territories; with the group stating that one of the key aims of the ""Go Beyond Oil"" campaign is to ""work to expose the lengths the oil industry is willing to go to squeeze the last barrels out of the ground and put pressure on industry and governments to move beyond oil.""[86]
 Greenpeace is opposed to nuclear power because it views it as 'dangerous, polluting, expensive and non-renewable'. The organization highlights the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986 and Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011 as evidence of the risk nuclear power can pose to peoples lives, the environment and the economy.[89] Greenpeace views the benefits of nuclear power to be relatively minor in comparison to its major problems and risks, such as environmental damage and risks from uranium mining, nuclear weapons proliferation, and unresolved questions concerning nuclear waste.[90] The organization argues that the potential of nuclear power to mitigate global warming is marginal, referring to the IEA energy scenario where an increase in world's nuclear capacity from 2608 TWh in 2007 to 9857 TWh by 2050 would cut global greenhouse gas emissions less than 5% and require 32 nuclear reactor units of 1000MW capacity built per year until 2050. According to Greenpeace the slow construction times, construction delays, and hidden costs, all negate the mitigation potential of nuclear power. This makes the IEA scenario technically and financially unrealistic. They also argue that binding massive amounts of investments on nuclear energy would take funding away from more effective solutions.[75] Greenpeace views the construction of Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant in Finland as an example of the problems on building new nuclear power.[91]
 In 1994, Greenpeace published an anti-nuclear newspaper advert which included a claim that nuclear facilities Sellafield would kill 2,000 people in the next 10 years, and an image of a hydrocephalus-affected child said to be a victim of nuclear weapons testing in Kazakhstan. Advertising Standards Authority viewed the claim concerning Sellafield as unsubstantiated, and ASA did not accept that the child's condition was caused by radiation. This resulted in the banning of the advert. Greenpeace did not admit fault, stating that a Kazakhstan doctor had said that the child's condition was due to nuclear testing. Adam Woolf from Greenpeace also stated that, ""fifty years ago there were many experts who would be lined up and swear there was no link between smoking and bad health.""[92] The UN has estimated that the nuclear weapon tests in Kazakhstan caused about 100,000 people to suffer over three generations.[93]
 In 2011, a French court fined Électricité de France (EDF) €1.5m and jailed two senior employees for spying on Greenpeace, including hacking into Greenpeace's computer systems. Greenpeace was awarded €500,000 in damages.[94] Although EDF claimed that a security firm had only been employed to monitor Greenpeace, the court disagreed, jailing the head and deputy head of EDF's nuclear security operation for three years each. EDF appealed the conviction, the company was cleared of conspiracy to spy on Greenpeace and the fine was cancelled.[95] Two employees of the security firm, Kargus, run by a former member of France's secret services, received sentences of three and two years respectively.[96]
 The Ozone layers surrounding the Earth absorb significant amounts of ultraviolet radiation. A 1976 report by the US Academy of Sciences supported the ozone ""depletion hypothesis.""[97] Its suffering large losses from chlorinated and nitrogenous compounds was reported in 1985.[98] Earlier studies had led some countries to enact bans on aerosol sprays, so that the Vienna Convention was signed in 1985[99] the Montreal Protocol was signed in 1987 to go in force two years later.[100] The use of CFCs and HCFCs in refrigeration were and are among the banned technologies. A German technological institute developed an ozone-safe hydrocarbon alternative refrigerant which came to a Greenpeace campaigner's attention in around 1992.[101][102] The rights to the technology were donated to Greenpeace, which maintained it as an open source patent. With industry resistance, Greenpeace was able to rescue and engage a former East German manufacturer near closure. Greenpeace's resourceful outreach and marketing resulted in the technologies rapid widespread production in Germany, followed by the banning of CFC technology. They then succeeded in getting Greenfreeze used in China and elsewhere in Europe, and after some years in Japan and South America, and finally in the US by 2012.
 Greenpeace aims to protect intact primary forests from deforestation and degradation with the target of zero deforestation by 2020. Greenpeace has accused several corporations, such as Unilever,[103] Nike,[104] KFC, Kit Kat and McDonald's[105] of having links to the deforestation of the tropical rainforests, resulting in policy changes in several of the companies under criticism.[106][107][108] Greenpeace, together with other environmental NGOs, also campaigned for ten years for the EU to ban import of illegal timber. The EU decided to ban illegal timber in July 2010.[109] As deforestation contributes to global warming, Greenpeace has demanded that REDD (Reduced Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) should be included in the climate treaty following the Kyoto treaty.[110]
 Another Greenpeace movement concerning the rain forests is discouraging palm oil industries.[111] The movement has been the most active in Indonesia where already 6 million hectares are used for palm oil plantation and has plans for another 4 million hectares by 2015. Acknowledging that mass production of palm oil may be disastrous on biodiversity of forests, Greenpeace is actively campaigning against the production, urging the industries and the government to turn to other forms of energy resources. One of the positive results of the campaign was GAR(Golden Agri-Resources),[112] the world's second largest palm oil production company, deciding to commit itself to forest conservation. The company signed an agreement which prevents them from developing plantations in areas where large amounts of carbon are locked up.
 On the promotional side, an example of Greenpeace's success in the area is a viral video from 2016 protesting Nestlé's use of palm oil in Kit Kat bars. The video received over 1 million views, and resulted in a public statement by Nestlé claiming to no longer use such practices in their products.[113] In 2018, Greenpeace released an animated short starring a fictional orangutan named Rang-tan ahead of the World Orangutan Day.[114] In November 2018, UK's Clearcast have denied a version of Rang-tan video as submitted by Iceland Foods Ltd.[115]
 In June 1995, Greenpeace took a trunk of a tree from the forests of the proposed national park of Koitajoki[116] in Ilomantsi, Finland and put it on display at exhibitions held in Austria and Germany. Greenpeace said in a press conference that the tree was originally from a logged area in the ancient forest which was supposed to be protected. Metsähallitus accused Greenpeace of theft and said that the tree was from a normal forest and had been left standing because of its old age. Metsähallitus also said that the tree had actually crashed over a road during a storm.[117] The incident received publicity in Finland, for example in the large newspapers Helsingin Sanomat and Ilta-Sanomat.[118] Greenpeace replied that the tree had fallen down because the protective forest around it had been clearcut, and that they wanted to highlight the fate of old forests in general, not the fate of one particular tree.[119] Greenpeace also highlighted that Metsähallitus admitted the value of the forest afterwards as Metsähallitus currently refers to Koitajoki as a distinctive area because of its old growth forests.[120][121]
 25 June 2018 – After an investigation conducted by Greenpeace International, it has been revealed that Wilmar International (the world's largest palm oil trader) is still linked to forest destruction in the Indonesian province of Papua. The deforestation conducted by Gama (a palm oil business run by senior Wilmar executives) has reached twice the size of Paris. Greenpeace is also calling Wilmar out for breaking the commitment to end deforestation policy signed by Wilmar in December 2013 where they promise to incorporate organic and sustainable ways to collect palm oil.[122]
 Global head of Greenpeace on Southeast Asia, Kiki Taufik, argues that ""Wilmar must immediately cut off all palm oil suppliers that can’t prove they aren’t destroying rainforests."" He also added that ""Wilmar has been trading Gama’s oil all over the world, including top brands like P&G, Nestlé and Unilever. Brands cannot let this deception pass unchallenged and have no choice but to suspend all business with Wilmar until it can prove it only trades clean palm oil from responsible producers."" [123]
 Until now, Wilmar's executives have only denied the accusation labeling them as ""false"" and are not taking any blame on them. The debate reminds unsolved.
 In 2008, two Greenpeace anti-whaling activists, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, stole a case of whale meat from a delivery depot in Aomori prefecture, Japan. Their intention was to expose what they considered embezzlement of the meat collected during whale hunts. After a brief investigation of their allegations was ended, Sato and Suzuki were arrested and charged with theft and trespassing.[124] Amnesty International said that the arrests and following raids on Greenpeace Japan office and homes of five of Greenpeace staff members were aimed at intimidating activists and non-governmental organizations.[125] They were convicted of theft and trespass in September 2010 by the Aomori district court.
 Greenpeace has also supported the rejection of GM food from the US in famine-stricken Zambia as long as supplies of non-genetically engineered grain exist, stating that the US ""should follow in the European Union's footsteps and allow aid recipients to choose their food aid, buying it locally if they wish. This practice can stimulate developing economies and creates more robust food security"", adding that, ""if Africans truly have no other alternative, the controversial GE maize should be milled so it can't be planted. It was this condition that allowed Zambia's neighbours Zimbabwe and Malawi to accept it.""[126] After Zambia banned all GM food aid, the former agricultural minister of Zambia criticized, ""how the various international NGOs that have spoken approvingly of the government's action will square the body count with their various consciences.""[127] Concerning the decision of Zambia, Greenpeace has stated that, ""it was obvious to us that if no non-GM aid was being offered then they should absolutely accept GM food aid. But the Zambian government decided to refuse the GM food. We offered our opinion to the Zambian government and, as many governments do, they disregarded our advice.""[128]
 Greenpeace opposes the planned use of golden rice, a variety of Oryza sativa rice produced through genetic engineering to biosynthesize beta-carotene, a precursor of pro-vitamin A in the edible parts of rice. The addition of beta-carotene to the rice is seen as preventative to loss of sight in poverty stricken countries where golden rice is intended for distribution. According to Greenpeace, golden rice has not managed to do anything about malnutrition for 10 years during which alternative methods are already tackling malnutrition. The alternative proposed by Greenpeace is to discourage monocropping and to increase production of crops which are naturally nutrient-rich (containing other nutrients not found in golden rice in addition to beta-carotene). Greenpeace argues that resources should be spent on programs that are already working and helping to relieve malnutrition.[129]
 The renewal of these concerns coincided with the publication of a paper in the journal Nature about a version of golden rice with much higher levels of beta carotene.[130] This ""golden rice 2"" was developed and patented by Syngenta, which provoked Greenpeace to renew its allegation that the project is driven by profit motives and to serve as propaganda aimed at increasing public opinion of GMO products.[131][132]
 Although Greenpeace had stated that the true efficiency of the golden rice program in treating malnourished populations was its primary concern as early as 2001,[133] statements from March and April 2005 also continued to express concern over human health and environmental safety.[134][135] In particular, Greenpeace has expressed concern over the lack of safety testing being done on GMO crops such as golden rice and of ""playing with the lives of people...using Golden Rice to promote more GMOs"".[131]
 In June 2016, a conglomeration of 107 Nobel Laureates signed an open letter[21] urging Greenpeace to end its campaign against genetically modified crops and Golden Rice in particular.[136][137] In the letter, they also called upon governments of the world to ""do everything in their power to oppose Greenpeace's actions and accelerate the access of farmers to all the tools of modern biology, especially seeds improved through biotechnology."" The letter states that ""Opposition based on emotion and dogma contradicted by data must be stopped.""[21] Greenpeace responded stating that ""Accusations that anyone is blocking genetically engineered 'Golden' rice are false"" and that they support ""...investing in climate-resilient ecological agriculture and empowering farmers to access a balanced and nutritious diet, rather than pouring money down the drain for GE 'Golden' rice.""[138]
 In July 2011, Greenpeace released its Dirty Laundry report accusing some of the world's top fashion and sportswear brands of releasing toxic waste into China's rivers.[139] The report profiles the problem of water pollution resulting from the release of toxic chemicals associated with the country's textile industry. Investigations focused on wastewater discharges from two facilities in China; one belonging to the Youngor Group located on the Yangtze River Delta and the other to Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. located on a tributary of the Pearl River Delta. Scientific analysis of samples from both facilities revealed the presence of hazardous and persistent hormone disruptor chemicals, including alkylphenols, perfluorinated compounds and perfluorooctane sulfonate.
 The report goes on to assert that the Youngor Group and Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. - the two companies behind the facilities - have commercial relationships with a range of major clothing brands, including Abercrombie & Fitch, Adidas, Bauer Hockey, Calvin Klein, Converse, Cortefiel, H&M, Lacoste, Li Ning, Metersbonwe Group, Nike, Phillips-Van Heusen and Puma AG.
 In 2013, Greenpeace launched the ""Detox Fashion"" campaign, which signed up some fashion brands to stop the discharge of toxic chemicals into rivers as a result of the production of their clothes.[140]
 In August 2006, Greenpeace released the first edition of Guide to Greener Electronics, a magazine where mobile and PC manufacturers were ranked for their green performance, mainly based in the use of toxic materials in their products and e-waste.[141] In November 2011, the criteria were updated, as the industry had progressed since 2006, with the objective to get companies to set goals for greenhouse gas reduction, the use of renewable power up to 100 percent, producing long lasting products free of hazardous substances and increasing sustainable practices. To ensure the transparency of the ranking the companies are assessed based only on their public information. For proving companies' policies and practices, Greenpeace uses chemical testing of products, reports from industry observers, media reports and testing of consumer programs to check if they match with their actions. Since the Guide was released in 2006, along with other similar campaigns has driven numerous improvements, when companies ranked eliminate toxic chemicals from their products and improve their recycling schemes. The last published edition of Guide to Greener Electronics was in 2017. The 2017 version included 17 major IT companies and ranked them on three criteria: energy use, resource consumption and chemical elimination.[142]
 In continuity of the successful campaign to reach the Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, in 2012 and 2013 protests with ""Save the Arctic"" banners were started. To stop oil- and gas-drilling, industrial fishing and military operations in the Arctic region completely, a ""global sanctuary in the high arctic"" was demanded from the World leaders at the UN General Assembly: ""We want them to pass a UN resolution expressing international concern for the Arctic."" A resolution to protect the very vulnerable wildlife and ecosystem.[143] 30 Arctic Sunrise activists were arrested in the Pechora Sea, 19 September 2013, witnessing oil-drilling and protesting at the Gazprom platform Prirazlomnaya by the Russian Coast Guard.[144] Greenpeace members were originally charged with Piracy, then later downgraded to hooliganism, before being dropped altogether following the passage of an amnesty law by the Russian government.[145]
 In July 2014, Greenpeace launched a global boycott campaign to persuade Lego to cease producing toys carrying the oil company Shell's logo in response to Shell's plans to drill for oil in the Arctic.[146] Lego's partnership with Shell dates back to the 1960s, although the LEGO company created a fictional oil company called Octan. Octan has appeared in countless sets, computer and console games, can be seen at Legoland parks, and is featured as the corporation headed by the villain President Business in The Lego Movie.[147]
 There is a conflict over oil rigs in the Arctic Ocean between the Norwegian Government and Greenpeace. In 2013, three activists of Greenpeace got on a Statoil's oil rig, wearing bear suits. According to a spokesman from Greenpeace Russia, they stayed on the rig for about three hours. The activists in bear suits ""were escorted"" to the shore. Statoil reportedly did not intend to file a suit against them.[148]
 Greenpeace had argued that Statoil's drilling plans posed a threat to Bear Island, an uninhabited wildlife sanctuary that is home to rare species including polar bears, because an oil spill would be nearly impossible to clean up in the Arctic because of the harsh conditions.[149] Greenpeace regards the petroleum activities of Statoil as ""illegal"".[150] Statoil denies the Greenpeace statement. According to The Maritime Executive (2014),[151] Statoil says ""Statoil respects people's right to make a legal protest, and we feel it is important to have a democratic debate around the oil industry. We have established robust plans for the operation, and feel confident they can be carried out safely and without accidents.""
 On 27 May 2014, Greenpeace's ship, MV Esperanza, took over Transocean Spitsbergen, oil rig of Statoil[152] in the Barents Sea such that it became incapable of operating. After that, the manager of Greenpeace Norway Norway Truls Gulowsen answered a phone interview, stating that ""Five protesters left the rig by helicopter last night and three returned to a nearby Greenpeace ship.""[153] There were seven more protesters on the rig at the time, but the Norwegian police could not remove them immediately because the rig was a flag of convenience ship registered in the Marshall Islands and thus regarded as a ship in the open sea, as long as it did not begin drilling. On 29 May, however, the seven activists from Greenpeace were peacefully captured by Norwegian police on the rig. Soon after, according to Reuters, all the activists were set free without any fine. On 30 May, the Norwegian Coast Guard finally towed away Esperanza, though in the morning Greenpeace submitted a plea on which more than 80,000 signatures to the Norwegian Environment Minister Tine Sundtoft in Oslo were written. Norwegian government and police reportedly allowed the coast guard to tow the Greenpeace ship.[154]
 The Norwegian police stated that Statoil asked Greenpeace to stop preventing its activities, but Greenpeace ignored the warning. The police have stated that Greenpeace's interference with the petroleum activities of Statoil was the contrary to Norwegian law and ordered Greenpeace to leave the Barents Sea site.[150] Statoil said delays to the start of drilling cost the company about $1.26 million per day.[154]
 According to Reuters, Statoil was slated to begin drilling ""three oil wells in the Apollo, Atlantis and Mercury prospects in the Hoop area, [which is] some 300 km away from the mainland [of Norway]"" in the summer of 2014. Greenpeace has continued to criticize the big oil company for their ""green wash,"" arguing that Statoil hid the truth that it is doing the risky oil drilling by holding ""Lego League"" with Lego and distracting people's attention to the company's project, and it also argues that Statoil has to alter its attitude toward environments[155] (Norway's News in English 2014).
 Since Greenpeace was founded, seagoing ships have played a vital role in its campaigns.
 In 1978, Greenpeace launched the original Rainbow Warrior, a 40-metre (130 ft), former fishing trawler named after the book Warriors of the Rainbow, which inspired early activist Robert Hunter on the first voyage to Amchitka. Greenpeace purchased the Rainbow Warrior (originally launched as the Sir William Hardy in 1955) at a cost of £40,000. Volunteers restored and refitted it over a period of four months. First deployed to disrupt the hunt of the Icelandic whaling fleet, the Rainbow Warrior would quickly become a mainstay of Greenpeace campaigns. Between 1978 and 1985, crew members also engaged in direct action against the ocean-dumping of toxic and radioactive waste, the grey seal hunt in Orkney and nuclear testing in the Pacific. In May 1985, the vessel was instrumental for 'Operation Exodus', the evacuation of about 300 Rongelap Atoll islanders whose home had been contaminated with nuclear fallout from a US nuclear test two decades earlier which had never been cleaned up and was still having severe health effects on the locals.[157]
 Later in 1985 the Rainbow Warrior was to lead a flotilla of protest vessels into the waters surrounding Moruroa atoll, site of French nuclear testing. The sinking of the Rainbow Warrior occurred when the French government secretly bombed the ship in Auckland harbour on orders from François Mitterrand himself. This killed Dutch freelance photographer Fernando Pereira, who thought it was safe to enter the boat to get his photographic material after a first small explosion, but drowned as a result of a second, larger explosion.[158] The attack was a public relations disaster for France after it was quickly exposed by the New Zealand police. The French Government in 1987 agreed to pay New Zealand compensation of NZ$13 million and formally apologised for the bombing. The French Government also paid ₣2.3 million compensation to the family of the photographer. Later, in 2001, when the Institute of Cetacean Research of Japan called Greenpeace ""eco-terrorists"", Gert Leipold, then Executive Director of Greenpeace, detested the claim, saying ""calling non violent protest terrorism insults those who were injured or killed in the attacks of real terrorists, including Fernando Pereira, killed by State terrorism in the 1985 attack on the Rainbow Warrior"".[159]
 In 1989 Greenpeace commissioned a replacement Rainbow Warrior vessel, sometimes referred to as Rainbow Warrior II. It retired from service on 16 August 2011, to be replaced by the third generation vessel. In 2005 the Rainbow Warrior II ran aground on and damaged the Tubbataha Reef in the Philippines while inspecting the reef for coral bleaching. Greenpeace was fined US$7,000 for damaging the reef and agreed to pay the fine saying they felt responsible for the damage, although Greenpeace stated that the Philippines government had given it outdated charts. The park manager of Tubbataha appreciated the quick action Greenpeace took to assess the damage to the reef.[160]
 Lawsuits have been filed against Greenpeace for lost profits,[161] reputation damage[162] and ""sailormongering"".[163] In 2004 it was revealed that the Australian government was willing to offer a subsidy to Southern Pacific Petroleum on the condition that the oil company would take legal action against Greenpeace, which had campaigned against the Stuart Oil Shale Project.[164]
 Some corporations, such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Électricité de France have reacted to Greenpeace campaigns by spying on Greenpeace activities and infiltrating Greenpeace offices.[165][166] Greenpeace activists have also been targets of phone tapping, death threats, violence[39] and even state terrorism in the case of the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior.[167][168]
 Patrick Moore, an early Greenpeace member, left the organization in 1986 when it, according to Moore, decided to support a universal ban on chlorine[169] in drinking water.[19] Moore has argued that Greenpeace today is motivated by politics rather than science and that none of his ""fellow directors had any formal science education"".[19] Bruce Cox, Director of Greenpeace Canada, responded that Greenpeace has never demanded a universal chlorine ban and that Greenpeace does not oppose use of chlorine in drinking water or in pharmaceutical uses, adding that ""Mr. Moore is alone in his recollection of a fight over chlorine and/or use of science as his reason for leaving Greenpeace.""[170] Paul Watson, an early member of Greenpeace has said that Moore ""uses his status as a so-called co-founder of Greenpeace to give credibility to his accusations. I am also a co-founder of Greenpeace and I have known Patrick Moore for 35 years.[...] Moore makes accusations that have no basis in fact"".[171] More recently, Moore has been particularly critical of Greenpeace's stance on golden rice, an issue where Moore has been joined by other environmentalists such as Mark Lynas,[172] claiming that Greenpeace has ""waged a campaign of misinformation, trashed the scientists who are working to bring Golden Rice to the people who need it, and supported the violent destruction of Golden Rice field trials.""[173]
 Patrick Moore also reversed his position on nuclear power in 1976,[174] first opposing it and now supporting it.[175][176][177] In Australian newspaper The Age, he writes ""Greenpeace is wrong—we must consider nuclear power"".[178] He argues that any realistic plan to reduce reliance on fossil fuels or greenhouse gas emissions need increased use of nuclear energy.[175] Phil Radford, Executive Director of Greenpeace US responded that nuclear energy is too risky, takes too long to build to address climate change, and claims that most countries, including the U.S., could shift to nearly 100% renewable energy while phasing out nuclear power by 2050.[179][180]
 A French journalist under the pen name Olivier Vermont wrote in his book La Face cachée de Greenpeace (""The Hidden Face of Greenpeace"") that he had joined Greenpeace France and had worked there as a secretary. According to Vermont he found misconduct, and continued to find it, from Amsterdam to the International office. Vermont said he found classified documents[181] according to which half of the organization's €180 million revenue was used for the organization's salaries and structure. He also accused Greenpeace of having unofficial agreements with polluting companies where the companies paid Greenpeace to keep them from attacking the company's image.[182] Animal protection magazine Animal People reported in March 1997 that Greenpeace France and Greenpeace International had sued Olivier Vermont and his publisher Albin Michel for issuing ""defamatory statements, untruths, distortions of the facts and absurd allegations"".[183]
 Writing in Cosmos, journalist Wilson da Silva reacted to Greenpeace's destruction of a genetically modified wheat crop in Ginninderra as another sign that the organization has ""lost its way"" and had degenerated into a ""sad, dogmatic, reactionary phalanx of anti-science zealots who care not for evidence, but for publicity"".[184]
 Research published in natural science journal Nature accused Greenpeace of not caring for facts, when it criticized the dumping of the Brent Spar tanker, and accused the group of exaggerating the volume of oil that was stored in the tanker.[185] Greenpeace had claimed that the tanker contained 5,500 tonnes of crude oil, while Shell estimated it only contained 50 tonnes.[186] However, the measurements had been made under duress during a protest occupation of the platform, since Shell had refused permission, and Greenpeace activists had been under attack by water cannons and the like.[187][188] The BBC issued an apology to Greenpeace for having reported that the NGO lied.[189]
 Shell UK took three years to evaluate the disposal options, concluding that the disposal of the tanker in the deep ocean was the ""Best Practicable Environmental Option"" (BPEO), an option which gained some support within some portion of the scientific community, as it was found by some to be of ""negligible"" environmental impact.[186] British government and Oslo and Paris Commissions (OSPAR) accepted the solution.[186]
 The resulting NGO campaign against Shell's proposals included letters, boycotts which even escalated to vandalism in Germany, and lobbying at intergovernmental conferences. Binding moratoriums supporting Greenpeace's, ecosystem protection, and the precautionary principle position were issued in more than one intergovernmental meeting, and at the 1998 OSPAR Convention, WWF presented a study of toxic effects on deep sea ecosystems. The meeting confirmed a general prohibition on ocean dumping.[190] Shell had transported the rig to the dumping site, but in the last hours canceled the operation and announced that it had failed in communicating its plans sufficiently to the public, admitting they had underestimated the strength of public opinion.[186] In January, 1998, Shell issued a new BPEO indicating recycling the rig as a quay in Norway.[191]
 In 1999, the Brent Spar container was decommissioned and one side issue that emerged was that the legs of the structure were found to contain cold-water coral species (Lophelia pertusa). As a result, the possibility was suggested of keeping the legs of such platforms on the sea bed in future, to serve as habitat.[186][192][193] A Greenpeace representative opposed the suggestion, citing the fact that the reefs formed by the coral are at risk, not the coral itself, and that such a move would not promote development of such reefs, and expose coral species to toxic substances found in oil.[194]
 In 2013 reports noted that Pascal Husting, the director of Greenpeace International's ""international programme"" was commuting 400 km (250 miles) to work by plane, despite Greenpeace's activism to reduce air travel due to carbon footprint.[195][196][197] Greenpeace has said ""the growth in aviation is ruining our chances of stopping dangerous climate change"".[198] After a ""public uproar"" Greenpeace announced that Husting would commute by train.[199][200]
 In December 2014, Greenpeace activists damaged rock related to the Nazca Lines in Peru while setting up a banner within the lines of one of the famed geoglyphs, and there were concerns that the harm might be irreparable. The activists damaged an area around the hummingbird by walking near the glyph without regulation footwear. Access to the area around the lines is strictly prohibited and[27][201] special shoes must be worn to avoid damaging the UN World Heritage site. Greenpeace claimed the activists were ""absolutely careful to protect the Nazca lines,""[202] but this is contradicted by video and photographs showing the activists wearing conventional shoes (not special protective shoes) while walking on the site.[203][204] Greenpeace has apologized to the Peruvian people,[205] but Loise Jamie Castillo, Peru's Vice Minister of Cultural Heritage called the apology ""a joke"", because Greenpeace refused to identify the vandals or accept responsibility.[206] Culture Minister Diana Álvarez-Calderón said that evidence gathered during an investigation by the government will be used as part of a legal suit against Greenpeace. ""The damage done is irreparable and the apologies offered by the environmental group aren't enough,"" she said at a news conference.[27] By January, 2015, Greenpeace had presented statements of four members of the NGO involved in the action.[207]
 During the 1990s Greenpeace conducted many anti-whaling expeditions in Norway. The criticism was that Greenpeace only campaigned against whales to gain economic donations from the US economy, and it had little to do with saving the environment. For example, shark hunting is a more pressing issue, but since sharks are widely feared in the United States, activism to help sharks doesn't receive as much financial support. Greenpeace has rejected this claim. However, in Norwegian Newspaper Dagbladet on 11 April 2015 Kumi Naidoo admitted that the anti-whale campaign was a ""miscalculation"".[208] Greenpeace holds that whaling was only resumed by Norway after the IWC ban because of political election motives, and faces many explicit hurdles, including decreased demand in Japan and toxic chemical contamination.[209]
 In June 2016, 107 Nobel laureates signed an open letter[21] urging Greenpeace to end its opposition to genetically modified organisms (GMOs).[210] The letter stated: ""We urge Greenpeace and its supporters to re-examine the experience of farmers and consumers worldwide with crops and foods improved through biotechnology, recognize the findings of authoritative scientific bodies and regulatory agencies, and abandon their campaign against ""GMOs"" in general and Golden Rice in particular. Scientific and regulatory agencies around the world have repeatedly and consistently found crops and foods improved through biotechnology to be as safe as, if not safer than those derived from any other method of production. There has never been a single confirmed case of a negative health outcome for humans or animals from their consumption. Their environmental impacts have been shown repeatedly to be less damaging to the environment, and a boon to global biodiversity."" The Nobel laureates also called upon governments of the world to ""do everything in their power to oppose Greenpeace's actions and accelerate the access of farmers to all the tools of modern biology, especially seeds improved through biotechnology."" The letter goes on to say that ""Opposition based on emotion and dogma contradicted by data must be stopped.""[21] Greenpeace responded stating that ""Accusations that anyone is blocking genetically engineered 'Golden' rice are false"" and that they support ""[...] investing in climate-resilient ecological agriculture and empowering farmers to access a balanced and nutritious diet, rather than pouring money down the drain for GE 'Golden' rice.""[138]
 The Nobel laureate letter was criticised by Silvia Ribeiro of the ETC Group, calling it more of ""a propaganda tirade from transgenic companies than scientists presenting a position,"" and arguing against its claimed benefits.[211]"
Habitat for Humanity	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_for_Humanity	"Habitat for Humanity International (HFHI), generally referred to as Habitat for Humanity or simply Habitat, is an international, non-governmental, and nonprofit organization, which was founded in 1976 by Linda and Millard Fuller. Habitat has been devoted to building ""simple, decent, and affordable"" housing, a self-described ""Christian housing ministry,"" and has addressed the issues of poverty housing all over the world.[1] The international operational headquarters are located in Americus, Georgia, United States, with the administrative headquarters located in Atlanta.[2] There are five area offices located around the world: United States and Canada; Africa and the Middle East (located in Pretoria, South Africa); Asia-Pacific (Manila, Philippines); Europe and Central Asia (Bratislava, Slovakia); and Latin America and the Caribbean (San Jose, Costa Rica).
 Community-level Habitat offices act in partnership with and on behalf of Habitat for Humanity International. In the United States, these local offices are called Habitat affiliates; outside the United States, Habitat operations are managed by national offices. Each affiliate and national office is an independently run, nonprofit organization. Affiliates and national offices coordinate all aspects of Habitat home building in their local area, including fundraising, building site selection, partner family selection and support, house construction, and mortgage servicing.
 The mission statement of Habitat for Humanity is ""Seeking to put God's love into action, Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities and hope"".[3] Homes are built using volunteer labor and Habitat makes no profit on the sales.[2] In some locations outside the United States, Habitat for Humanity charges interest to protect against inflation. This policy has been in place since 1986. Habitat has helped more than 4 million people construct, rehabilitate or preserve more than 800,000 homes since its founding in 1976, making Habitat the largest not-for-profit builder in the world.[4][5]
 Habitat for Humanity traces its origins to the time Linda and Millard Fuller spent at Koinonia Farm in 1965. The couple had a successful business in Montgomery, Alabama before they started a new life of Christian service.[6]
 According to the official website,
 The affiliate's family selection committee chooses homeowners based on their level of need, their willingness to become partners in the program and their ability to repay the loan. Every affiliate follows a nondiscriminatory policy of family selection. Neither race nor religion is a factor in choosing the families who receive Habitat houses.[1]
 There are several checks and balances in place to protect both Habitat and the potential homeowner:
 Habitat for Humanity performs an extensive background check on potential homeowners, including character references, employer interviews, and audit of finances. The applicants are required to sign release forms authorizing Habitat for Humanity to perform this background check. This ensures that Habitat's risk is reasonable when selling a home and that the applicant family is in a suitable financial position to take on the responsibility of a mortgage.
 There are typically a First and a Second Mortgage. The Second Mortgage is put in place to protect any equity that is left that is not captured in the first mortgage. The homeowners pay down the first mortgage, and after a stated period of time (which varies from affiliate to affiliate) of living in the same home, the Second Mortgage is forgiven (however, it is not always forgiven). However, The Right of First Refusal stays in force until the mortgage is paid in full.
 Homeowners are usually expected to put approximately 500 hours of ""sweat equity"" into their own or other project homes, although this amount may vary by location, the number of wage-earning adults in each family, and the recipients' health issues. This sweat equity acts as the down payment on the home. Every hour spent earning this sweat equity must be approved and signed off on by an official Habitat for Humanity representative. Sweat equity has no monetary value and cannot be 'refunded'.
 Once construction on the home is finished and the sweat equity is completed in full, the homeowner purchases the home with a 0% to 2% interest mortgage (in the United States). With monthly payments (including taxes and insurance) that do not exceed 30% of the household's monthly income.
 Mortgage payments from homeowners are deposited into a locally administered ""Fund for Humanity"", the proceeds of which go toward future construction. In an effort to discourage predatory lenders from targeting Habitat homeowner families, mortgage agreements require the Habitat for Humanity affiliate the right of first refusal. Until the mortgage is paid in full, a Habitat home has no equity and can only be sold back to Habitat for Humanity. Should a homeowner family decide to sell their home during the period of their mortgage, the affiliate will buy it back at market value. Often affiliates will have a shared appreciation model that will allow the affiliate to recapture a portion of the equity in the home depending on the time the family lived in the home and paid on the mortgage.[7]
 The typically no interest mortgage payments permit a family the freedom to manage their finances more effectively, the end goal being to provide a 'hand up' and not a 'hand out' as it were. In some locations, attendance at money management courses is mandatory for potential homeowners.
 Habitat relies on volunteer labor in order to construct simple and affordable homes with its partner families, as well as to build community and civil society in the areas in which it works. Many churches and other houses of worship (synagogues, temples, mosques etc.) sponsor houses and provide a large amount of the volunteers from their congregations. Some corporations and businesses that value good corporate citizenship provide financial support to the projects and/or donate materials for use in construction. Many politicians and celebrities have volunteered with Habitat, reflecting its profile as a highly regarded non-profit.
 Habitat builds simple houses with locally appropriate materials. In many communities, Habitat affiliates and national offices are exploring areas of green building, including energy efficiency and sustainability. In the United States, many affiliates are building homes that are LEED certified.[8] In 2010, Habitat for Humanity Tajikistan won a national Global Energy Award for their resource-saving bio-sand water filter project.[9]
 Habitat affiliates and national offices contribute a percentage of the unrestricted funds they raise locally to be used in building homes by a Habitat national office overseas. For instance, Habitat New Zealand's tithe helps to support an equal number of housing outcomes abroad, predominantly in the Pacific region.
 Habitat homeowners in the United States and Canada pay no interest on their no-profit mortgages. Some Habitat for Humanity affiliates outside the United States adjust the no-profit loans to compensate for the inflation rate in their area, with the goal that ""the repayments from one house should ideally build another house of the same design"".[10]
 Habitat ReStores are retail outlets that sell new and used building and household materials donated by small businesses, large companies, job sites, and individuals. Proceeds from ReStores help local affiliates fund the construction of Habitat houses within the community. Many affiliates across the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand operate successful ReStores‍—‌some of which raise enough funds to build an additional 10 or more houses per year.[11] Many ReStores cover the administrative costs of the Habitat affiliate so that 100% of donor funds can be put toward home construction and rehabilitation projects.
 Habitat for Humanity International develops and supports special programs to engage volunteers from all walks of life in Habitat's mission and work.
 Solid Ground is a global advocacy campaign of Habitat for Humanity International focused on improving access to land for shelter. The Solid Ground campaign has four sub-themes: secure tenure, gender equality, slum upgrading, and disaster resilience. Through the Solid Ground campaign, Habitat for Humanity and partner organizations are working in 37 countries around the world to change land policy and systems at all levels of government.
 Habitat for Humanity's A Brush With Kindness is a locally operated program serving low-income homeowners who struggle to maintain the exterior of their homes. The program is a holistic approach to providing affordable housing and assisting communities as well as families. Groups of volunteers help homeowners with exterior maintenance. This typically includes painting, minor exterior repairs, landscaping, weatherization and exterior clean-up.[12]
 As suggested by the name, Habitat for Humanity International places a strong emphasis on building homes around the world. Volunteers today can build with Habitat affiliates in many locations on Global Village Trips.[13] After having gone through training, trip leaders organize travel plans with the support of the Americus-headquartered Global Village Department, first formally established in 1988. Participants from all over are then able to register for trips to their destination of choice. Teams generally number between eight and fifteen, with trips usually lasting between nine and fourteen days.
 According to the website, Global Village Trips offer volunteers the opportunity:
 to experience another culture while making a difference in the lives of others ... work alongside members of the host community in building decent, affordable housing ... [and]help raise awareness of the burden of poverty housing and create a true global village of love, community, homes and hope.[14] National Service refers to national service programs that are funded by the Corporation for National and Community Service. The goal of the Habitat for Humanity National Service program is to help local Habitat affiliates operate more efficiently and effectively by maximizing existing volunteers, increasing capacity for new volunteers and most importantly, meeting the housing needs of communities by building more houses for low-income families.[15]
 AmeriCorps is a network of national service programs that engage more than 75,000 Americans each year in intensive service to meet critical needs in education, public safety, health and the environment. Habitat for Humanity International was one of the first nonprofits contacted by the Corporation for National and Community Service when AmeriCorps was being formed in 1993. In the 2008–2009 program year, over 500 AmeriCorps members at affiliates all over the country will help build nearly 2,000 houses and recruit and retain nearly 200,000 community volunteers. Those volunteers will provide an estimated 1,600,000 volunteer hours. The members themselves will contribute 850,000 hours.[16]
 RV Care-A-Vanners is a volunteer program in which volunteers travel in their personal recreational vehicles, making stops at local Habitat affiliates to assist in house construction and renovations. RV Care-A-Vanner volunteers each pay their own expenses, which may be tax deductible.
 Many RV Care-A-Vanners help local Habitat affiliates raise the awareness of poverty housing and homelessness by speaking to churches, civic groups and local media. Individual Care-A-Vanners often make donations to their local Habitat affiliate and some even organize fund-raising teams and sponsor entire houses.[17]
 Originating in 1991 with a Charlotte, North Carolina home built entirely by a crew of female volunteers, Habitat's Women Build program encourages women to make a difference by building homes and communities. Women Build projects provide an environment in which women can feel comfortable learning construction skills they might not otherwise have the opportunity to learn. Globally, more than 1,400 homes have been completed by Women Build volunteers.[18]
 Women all over the United States participate in National Women Build Week. The week-long build leading up to Mother's Day is designed to showcase the skills of Women Build volunteers and to motivate new volunteers to help families and change communities.
 Lowe's is a major sponsor and underwriter of Women Build, and has generously supported each National Women Build Week. In addition to competitive grant opportunities, Lowe's offers a series of free how-to clinics for U.S. Women Build affiliates.[19]
 Habitat for Humanity's Youth Programs seek to involve young people, ages 5 to 25, in Habitat's mission and work. In accordance with U.S. federal guidelines, youth must be at least 16 years old to be on an active construction site, and must be 18 years old to engage in certain build activities.[20]
 Habitat's Youth Programs include programs such as:
 A campus chapter is a student-led, student-initiated organization on a high school or college campus that partners with the local Habitat affiliate to fulfill the four functions of a campus chapter. The four functions of a campus chapter are: building, fundraising, advocating and educating.[21]
 Habitat for Humanity runs a year-round alternative break program known as Collegiate Challenge for student groups age 16 to 25.[22] Although summer, fall, and winter break trips are available, most participants go during their spring break. Collegiate Challenge participants travel to host sites throughout the United States and spend one week working in partnership with the local Habitat affiliate, the local community, and partner families to help eliminate poverty housing in the area. Host affiliates provide housing for the groups, as well as a place to shower and cook meals for the week. More than 14,000 volunteers took part in Collegiate Challenge in 2011, making it one of the world's largest alternative break programs. Since its inception in 1989, nearly 240,000 students have participated in Collegiate Challenge and have donated more than $25 million to Habitat for Humanity affiliates.[23]
 For one week during the summer, students ages 16 to 18 can experience Habitat's work outside of their communities. In addition to a week of building, students also learn about the need for Habitat through educational activities.[24]
 Youth United is a Habitat for Humanity program run by youth and for youth ages 5 to 25. It brings young people together from all walks of life to play active roles in transforming their communities. Youth United mobilizes young people to sponsor and build a house with their local Habitat affiliate.[25]
 Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter became involved with Habitat for Humanity in 1984 and has since become its highest profile proponent. He has been involved in fund-raising and publicity as well as actual homebuilding, taking part in the annual Jimmy Carter Work Project ""blitz build"".[26]
 In 2008, Habitat for Humanity celebrated the 25th annual building project with the Carters and renamed it to include Mrs. Carter. The Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project focused on supporting the Gulf Coast community seeking to rebuild after hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Despite periodic downpours, volunteers got most of the work done during one week in June to finish building and fixing 60 houses and frame 48 more.[27]
 In November 2009, volunteers joined Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter in the Mekong River region of Southeast Asia. Houses were built in the countries of Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Yunnan Province in China. The week-long project served nearly 166 families.[28] It also began a five-year Habitat for Humanity initiative to work with 50,000 families across the five countries.[28]
 During Home Builders Blitz 2008, more than 1,000 building industry professionals in 110 Habitat for Humanity affiliates built 263 new homes across the United States. This was the second national Home Builders Blitz program, which was begun on the local level in 2002 in Raleigh, North Carolina. Since then, the professional homebuilders industry has supported Habitat by building more than 800 homes.
 Tom Gipson, a Habitat volunteer and professional homebuilder who started the Home Builder's Blitz program, was named the ""Ultimate Volunteer"" in a 2009 contest by ABC's ""The View"".[29]
 The AmeriCorps Build-a-Thon is an annual signature event that brings together AmeriCorps members and alumni in a week long blitz build. The Build-a-Thon provides the host affiliate an opportunity to advance and highlight local house-building efforts. It also serves as an annual meeting of AmeriCorps volunteers who might otherwise lack any opportunity to meet.
 The event is held across the United States and highlights a different Habitat affiliate each year. In the past, Build-a-Thons have occurred in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; the Gulf Coast; Dallas, Texas; Mobile County, Alabama; and Jacksonville, Florida.
 The 2010, Habitat AmeriCorps Build-a-Thon was held in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, hosted by Cedar Valley Habitat for Humanity. This was the second consecutive year that Cedar Valley Habitat hosted the event. More than 500 Habitat for Humanity AmeriCorps National and AmeriCorps VISTA members from across the country came together to build, rehabilitate and repair more than 20 homes. In 2015, the Build-a-Thon was held in New Orleans in remembrance of Hurricane Katrina.
 Habitat initiated a special program to help restore housing to the areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The effort was focused on getting local affiliates in the area back on their feet and prepared to build for their communities. It also became a catalyst for other organizations, like the St. Bernard Project, corporations and the government to provide help and support in rebuilding the area and has received considerable national media attention.  Habitat restored around 300 homes for Katrina efforts.
 As part of Operation Home Delivery, housing components were assembled in nearby less-affected locations such as Jackson, Mississippi, allowing much of the construction to be accomplished while basic infrastructure was being restored. Pre-constructed components were then shipped to the affected areas and built at a faster rate. Within two months of the time of the disaster, construction had begun on houses in the Louisiana cities of Covington and Slidell, near New Orleans.
 Harry Connick Jr., and Branford Marsalis served as honorary chairs of Habitat's hurricane rebuilding program, and one of the many projects along the Gulf Coast is the Musicians' Village at New Orleans Habitat for Humanity.[30]
 On 12 January 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti just 10 miles west of the capital, Port-au-Prince. The earthquake damaged almost 190,000 houses, of which 105,000 were entirely devastated. Of the more than two million affected survivors, 500,000 are still displaced today. Soon after the earthquake, Habitat set a goal of serving 50,000 families over five years, helping them move toward safe, secure and permanent places to call home.
 Habitat has reached numerous milestones after the earthquake including over 155 houses as well as another 100 houses planned to be built starting 23 November of this year. Aside from direct building of housing, more than 4,000 families received transitional or upgraded shelters, more than 350 houses were repaired and rehabilitated, more than 24,500 emergency shelter kits were distributed, and more than 12,000 damage assessments were conducted (Habitat For Humanity International). During this time, an entire community was transformed and lives were changed. More than 4,450 Haiti citizens were trained in construction techniques, financial literacy, disaster risk reduction and business development, which resulted in job opportunities for over 700 Haitians (Habitat For Humanity International).
 Habitat played an integral in the restoration of Bangladesh after Cyclone Sidr devastated 31 districts. A partnership with Japan Platform to help build transitional shelters was on-going when the disaster hit in November 2007. All phases of this project completed at the end of February 2009.
 Habitat responded to the cyclone by pledging $250000 to provide technical assistance. Prior to the construction of transitional homes, immediate necessities such as food, water and medicine were distributed to affected families.
 A Habitat Resource Center was built in phase one for technical planning, coordination and management of the entire project. It also served as the manufacturing and storage center for construction materials. A total of 480 houses were built at the end of a 3 phase construction process. Each house was provided with proper sanitation using contributions from UNICEF Bangladesh and HFH Great Britain. These transitional shelters were designed to be built by volunteers and unskilled workers in about eight hours on an area that had been prepared by families. This shelter provides a strong and cyclone-resistant core structure to protect residents from severe weather. Extensions to the home when the family has the financial means can be done by adding walling to the existing structure.
 In bid to raise the local awareness of these transitional homes, HFH Bangladesh organized a series of training and familiarisation workshops for locals. 16 sessions were held between March and December 2008.
 In total, 12 communities were worked on by HFH Bangladesh. Structures had been built in the regions of Ghotoker Andua, Andua, Kalagachiya, Pipra Khali and Mirzaganj villages in Mirzaganj Union. In the Amragachia Union the regions of Uttar Amragachia, Dakkhin Amragachia, Shoilabunia, Kismat Shoilabunia and Amragachi villages also had structures built there.[31]
 There are many projects that go hand in hand with the house building projects that allow these homes to supply their own electricity through the use of solar energy. U.S. companies such as Pacific Gas and Electric Company have partnered with Habitat for Humanity to provide complete solar grids for several homes.[32] Other solar projects, mostly in the U.S., like one in San Francisco,[33] as well as efforts of individual citizens are trying to make a difference by raising funds to get more solar homes built.[34]
 The video for rock band Bon Jovi's song ""Who Says You Can't Go Home"" features Habitat for Humanity volunteers as well as the band building homes as part of Habitat for Humanity in Philadelphia, close to Bon Jovi's native New Jersey.  It reflects Jon Bon Jovi's dedication to the organization and highlights the importance of community unity, faith, and involvement. The popularity of Bon Jovi increased Habitat's exposure and influenced new volunteers to donate their time and money to Habitat.
 The Habitat Bicycle Challenge (HBC), a nine-week, coast-to-coast bicycle trip undertaken to raise funds for Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven and to increase awareness of Habitat for Humanity in general, took place annually from 1995 to 2007. Prior to embarking in June on the 4,000-mile (6,400 km) trek, participants engaged in a seven-month fundraising campaign for Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven. Once on the road, they served as roaming advertisements for Habitat and gave nightly presentations explaining Habitat's mission to their hosts, usually church congregations. They also took part in builds with local Habitat chapters along the way. At its height, HBC attracted about 90 participants a year, all aged 18 to 24 and about half coming from Yale University. Each rider traveled one of three routes: New Haven to San Francisco, New Haven to Portland, or New Haven to Seattle. By 2004 HBC had become the single largest yearly fundraiser for any Habitat affiliate in the world, raising about $400,000 a year. However, amid growing safety concerns, Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven was forced to announce the cancellation of HBC in September 2007.[35]
 Bike and Build, a similar program, was founded in 2002 by a former HBC rider. Though not directly affiliated with Habitat for Humanity, it carries on the legacy of the Habitat Bicycle Challenge.
 In the fall of 2007, alternative rock bands Switchfoot and Relient K went on the Appetite for Construction Tour, partnering with Habitat while raising awareness for the organization and donating a dollar per ticket sold. The tour was highly successful, raising over US$100,000 for donation to the cause.[36]
 Wesley College, Melbourne is carrying out a joint fundraising and awareness program through theatrical production and is aiming to raise money to build education facilities in Afghanistan.
 Like much construction activity, which carries inherent risk, Habitat for Humanity construction has led to some serious injuries or deaths to volunteers.[37][38][39][40] Consequently, safety is a priority and important consideration on Habitat construction sites, and volunteers are given safety orientations and they are required to work with skilled construction supervisors on the build sites.[41][42] Depending on the type of operation, OSHA rules may be generally applicable to Habitat construction sites, similar to for-profit builders. In some cases, Habitat affiliates have local partnerships with OSHA on safety programs.[43]
 An article in the Weekly Standard, an American conservative opinion magazine, questioned the cost-effectiveness of Habitat building projects. To estimate cost effectiveness, all costs associated with building a Habitat home must be used, including the cost of volunteer time and training.[44] For houses constructed by foreign volunteers, travel and associated costs paid by the volunteers are also significant. Including these costs raises the question whether building a house this way is an efficient use of resources. Particularly in developing countries where labor is relatively inexpensive, unemployment is high, and local currency is cheap, purchasing local labor and supplies may result in an increase in the number of houses built.
 Cost-effectiveness, however, is not Habitat for Humanity's only concern, and additional benefits arise from the Habitat model that differentiate it from other low-cost housing.  For example, involving volunteers in the construction of houses not only makes the homes more affordable, but it also builds community understanding, awareness and support for affordable housing and generates revenue for local Habitat organizations.  Focusing solely on cost effectiveness also does not address another important aspect—the education and training of the homebuyers.  Habitat's homebuyers are also involved in the construction of their home and the homes of others in the program.[45] Many Habitat organizations also provide training in budget management and other skills.  These requirements, known as ""sweat equity"", teach low-income homebuyers valuable construction and other skills that help them to maintain their home over the long-term.  Another major aspect of Habitat's program is Habitat's revolving ""Fund for Humanity.""  Habitat does not give homes away; rather, in addition to contributing sweat equity, Habitat homebuyers pay an affordable no-profit mortgage based on their ability to pay.  These mortgage payments are used to support building additional homes in partnership with low-income families, thus contributing to the sustainability of Habitat's homebuilding program.[46]
 Habitat has been criticized for its slow and inefficient rebuilding efforts along the Gulf Coast after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.[47] After 18 months, Habitat had completed under 500 homes. A major factor was Habitat's reliance on working through local affiliates, who are not equipped to undertake large-scale rebuilding efforts.
 Work continued and Habitat completed its 1,000th hurricane-response home by May 2007. By the fifth anniversary of Katrina, more than 2,716 homes had been completed. In total, Habitat's Gulf Coast affiliates built, repaired or rehabbed more than 5,400 houses as part of the hurricanes Katrina and Rita effort.[48]
 Habitat affiliates in the region have remained some of the largest homebuilders in their areas and have received numerous awards and acknowledgements for their work in building quality homes.[49][50][51][52]
 Families are required to show an ability to pay for their home in addition to the need for housing. With these requirements, homeless and low-income families may fail to qualify for a Habitat home. Most American Habitat affiliates perform credit checks and criminal record checks on applicants before partnering with them for the construction of a home. Some critics therefore allege that Habitat misrepresents the nature of its work by partnering with families that might be considered nearly ""middle-income.""[44] To address this, many Habitat affiliates in the United States partner only with families that fall below the government-set ""poverty line"" for their area. The current poverty rate is measured according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.[53]
 The credit and income requirements help ensure that Habitat applicants are able to maintain their houses. Foreclosure rates on Habitat houses are hard to measure. While Habitat claims a foreclosure rate of less than 2%, this number is unsubstantiated due to the fact that Habitat properties are not initially deeded to the buyer, and revert to the local Habitat chapter if a buyer defaults. The homeowners' monthly mortgage payments are used to build more Habitat homes.[1]
 Habitat's founder, Millard Fuller, and his wife were dismissed by the Habitat board of directors on 31 January 2005, citing ""a pattern of ongoing public comments and communications by the Fullers that have been divisive and disruptive to the organization's work""[54] after Fuller was accused by a former female employee of ""suggestive comments and inappropriate touching"" during a ride to the Atlanta airport in 2003. The Habitat board investigated Fuller for sexual harassment but found ""insufficient proof of inappropriate conduct"". Some Fuller supporters claim that the firing was due to a change in corporate culture.[55]
 Before Fuller's termination, attempts were made by former President Jimmy Carter to broker an agreement that would allow Fuller to retire with his $79,000 salary intact; when Fuller was found to have violated the non-disclosure portion of this agreement, he was subsequently fired.[56]
 In January 2008 a dispute arose between the parent organization and an unspecified number of local Habitat for Humanity affiliate organizations over the terms of their cooperation agreement. These local affiliates contended that the agreement gave the international organization too much power over the assets and operations of the local chapters. One of the affiliates, Habitat for Humanity of San Antonio, reached an agreement with HFHI in July 2008 to ""continue working together in their efforts to make affordable housing possible"".[57]
 By the end of 2008, the overwhelming majority of Habitat's U.S. affiliates had signed the agreement.[citation needed]"
Hands on Network	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hands_on_Network	"The HandsOn Network is a non-profit organization focusing on community service based in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A.  It seeks to bring people together to strengthen communities through meaningful volunteer action, and including some half million volunteers in communities inside and outside the United States. HandsOn Network creates and manages nearly 50,000 projects a year, from building wheelchair ramps in San Francisco to teaching reading in Atlanta, to rebuilding homes and lives in Gulf Coast communities following Hurricane Katrina.  Originally an independent organization, today it is part of the nonprofit organization Points of Light.
 The organization was founded 1992 under the name City Cares.  They sought an alternate way of doing volunteering, in contrast to established organizations such as the Points of Light Foundation and its associated Voluntary Action Centers.[1]  In particular, they sought to focus on attracting younger, more business-focused volunteers by offering a single day of service on a per-month basis.[1]  The national entity would then be an umbrella organization and which would provide shared resources to local entities.[2]
 Example local affiliates included New York Cares, which in point of fact was launched in 1987 and provided the basis for the later national model.[2]
 In 2004, City Cares renamed itself to the HandsOn Network.[1]
 Over time, HandsOn Network   became made up of 58 national and international volunteer organizations that act as entrepreneurial civic action centers. 
HandsOn Network worked in partnership with local organizations and schools to create HandsOn service projects that produce tangible benefits in communities. The Network enlisted a corps of hundreds of thousands of volunteers who join forces to address community needs worldwide.
 HandsOn Network collaborated with hundreds of major companies and organizations to promote volunteerism across the United States. They include the CMT television station[3] and SAP investments,[4] as well as several with nonprofit organizations and volunteer groups.[5] Additional corporate sponsors of HandsOn Network included 
Home Depot, Outback Steakhouse, Cisco Systems, Ameriquest, The Coca-Cola Company, Corporation for National and Community Service, W.K. Kellog Foundation, UnitedHealth Group, Case Foundation, Singing for Change, and others.
 In August 2007, HandsOn Network merged with the Points of Light Foundation to form the Points of Light Institute, the nation's largest network of organizations skilled at mobilizing volunteers to meet important needs in local communities.[6]"
Hands on Tzedakah	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hands_on_Tzedakah	"Hands On Tzedakah is a 501(c)(3) public charity headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida.  Founded in 2003,[1] the organization provides funding for various social service programs in the United States, Israel, and other countries.
 As of June 30, 2018, Hands On Tzedakah (“HOT”) had raised and distributed over $16,000,000[3] to support more than 100 projects in the United States, in Israel, and in other parts of the world.
 HOT's primary focus is to support essential safety-net programs addressing hunger, poverty, health care and disaster relief.[4] HOT assists programs providing support to the economically disadvantaged, disabled, elderly, and victims of abuse and terrorism.  HOT also provides scholarship support to students in need.[5]
 HOT connects the donors with the recipients and facilitates communication between the donors and the projects. In addition, HOT listens to the donor, seeking out new initiatives that are important to him/her.  Whenever possible, donor dollars are leveraged through matching funds from other donors and organizations.
 The initial criteria for funding requires that the project or need meet the parameters of the mission statement. If a program meets these parameters then prior to any substantial program funding, HOT engages in a ""Hands On"" process by researching the program and obtaining and reviewing information on budgets and other financial information, including tax returns and accounting reports. Also, there is a belief that utilizing volunteers is essential.
 In cases where funds are distributed to individual intermediaries who have developed programs that meet the criteria, HOT insists upon an ongoing interaction with regular financial and operating reports to Hands On Tzedakah so that there is satisfaction that the funds allocated to them are used as intended."
Heal the World Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heal_the_World_Foundation	"The original Heal the World Foundation was a charitable organization founded by  entertainer Michael Jackson in 1992. The foundation's creation was inspired by his charitable single of the same name. Through his foundation, Jackson airlifted 46 tons of supplies to Sarajevo, instituted drug and alcohol abuse education and donated millions of dollars to disadvantaged children, including the full payment of a Hungarian child's liver transplant. Failure to file yearly accounting statements saw the charity lose its tax exempt status in 2002. A different organization, with no relationship to Michael Jackson's foundation, incorporated in the state of California under the same name and applied for new tax exempt status in 2008.[1] The Jackson estate took legal action against this organisation for unfair competition and trademark infringement in 2009.[2]
 Prior to the creation of the Heal the World Foundation, Jackson had expressed great interest in humanitarianism, equality and world peace. Songs such as ""Can You Feel It"", ""We Are the World"" and ""Man in the Mirror"" convey this. Jackson also donated millions of dollars to charity, including his $5 million share from the Victory Tour.[3]
 In 1984, while filming a Pepsi Cola commercial, Jackson suffered second degree burns to his scalp after pyrotechnics accidentally set his hair on fire.[4] PepsiCo settled a lawsuit out of court, and Jackson gave his $1.5 million settlement to the ""Michael Jackson Burn Center"" which was a piece of new technology to help people with severe burns.[4]
 Shortly afterward, Jackson was invited to the White House to receive an award presented by American President Ronald Reagan. The award was given for Jackson's support of charities that helped people overcome alcohol and drug abuse.[5]
 In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity single ""We Are the World"" with Lionel Richie, which was released worldwide to aid the poor in Africa and the US. He was one of 39 music celebrities who performed on the record. The single became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20 million copies sold and millions of dollars donated to famine relief. It was also the first time Jackson was recognized for his humanitarian efforts.[6]
 Jackson founded the charity in 1992, naming it after his hit song, ""Heal the World"". The purpose of the charity was to provide medicine to children and fight world hunger, homelessness, child exploitation and abuse. Jackson stated that he wanted ""to improve the conditions for children throughout the world"".[7]
 The foundation also brought underprivileged children to Jackson's Neverland Ranch, located outside Santa Ynez, California, to go on theme park rides that Jackson had built on the property after he purchased it in 1988.
 The Dangerous World Tour began on June 27, 1992, and finished on November 11, 1993. Jackson performed to 3.5 million people in 69 concerts. All profits from the concerts went to the ""Heal the World Foundation"", raising millions of dollars in relief.[8] Through the foundation, Jackson airlifted 46 tons of supplies to Sarajevo and paid for a Hungarian child's liver transplant.[9]
 One of Jackson's most acclaimed performances came during the halftime show at the National Football League's Super Bowl XXVII. At the show, Jackson performed his anthem ""Heal the World"", to help promote the organization with the assistance of a choir of 750 people and a flash card display involving 98,000 volunteers. Jackson donated his entire fees to the foundation, with the NFL also donating $100,000 and a 30-second TV spot to push for contributions.[7][10][11]
 Following the Super Bowl, Jackson ran a full-page advertisement in the newspaper USA Today, providing a toll-free number. A coupon was provided that could be clipped and mailed in along with a contribution. Those donating $35 or more were given a ""Heal the World"" T-shirt.[7]
 The environmental themed music video for ""Earth Song"" closed with a request for donations to Jackson's foundation.[12]
 In 1997, Jackson earned money from photographs of his son, Prince Michael. The photographs were sold to ""OK!"" magazine and the National Enquirer, raising $3 million for the foundation.[13]
 In February 2001, Jackson launched Heal the Kids, an initiative of HTWF and part of the foundation's attempt to boost children's welfare.[14] Jackson launched the charity initiative, stating, ""Heal the Kids will help adults and parents realize it's in our power to change the world our children live in"".[15]
 Jackson gave a speech at Oxford University about raising children, as part of the launch of his ""Heal the Kids"" initiative.  In the speech, Jackson spoke rhetorically of his children, ""What if they grow older and resent me, and how my choices impacted their youth?...Why weren't we given a normal childhood like all the other children? And at that moment I pray that my children will give me the benefit of the doubt. That they will say to themselves: Our daddy did the best he could, given the unique circumstances he faced. I hope that they will focus on the positives things, on the sacrifices I willingly made for them..."". Journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli concluded that Jackson's performance during the speech was ""absorbing"" and well received.[16]
 In 2002, the Heal the World Foundation was suspended, after failing to file yearly accounting statements, required for tax-exempt organizations. Records showed that the foundation had net assets of $3,542 and reported $2,585 in expenses. The foundation did not have a director, president or other top manager besides Jackson, who was listed as chairman.[9]
 A separate charity named 'Heal the World Foundation was set up in 2008. On August 11, 2009, CBS News reported that:  ""... representatives of the Jackson estate say the foundation is not linked, ""The Michael Jackson estate has no connection whatsoever to the ""Heal the World Foundation"" run by Melissa Johnson,"" said Terry Fahn, a spokesperson for John Branca, the special administrator of the Jackson estate.""[1] On September 30, the Jackson Foundation started law action against the charity claiming that the ""Defendants' acts of infringement and unfair competition have been committed with the intent to cause confusion, mistake and to deceive"".[17]"
Heart to Heart International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_to_Heart_International	"Heart to Heart International is a global humanitarian organization based in Lenexa which works to improve health and to respond to the needs of disaster victims worldwide.
 Heart to Heart International was founded in 1992 by Dr. Gary Morsch and other Rotary Club members who delivered medication to victims of Chernobyl disaster in Russia. In 27 years, it has shipped over $1.7 billion in humanitarian aid to more than 130 countries. A large focus of HHI's mission is disaster response, and HHI has been a first responder to disasters all over the world. Heart to Heart International's headquarters is located in Lenexa, Kansas.
 Heart to Heart currently has teams deployed in Cyprus and Jordan that are handing out water-purification tablets and medical aid supplies to refugee camps.
 When the 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Java, Heart to Heart mobilized its network to reach out to those in Yogyakarta and Bantul. Not only are water and medical supplies being passed out to those in need, but intermediate general hygiene and healthcare is being offered. Several airlifts have been delivered to the region, and aid will continue to come in as the quality of life improves.
 When Hurricane Katrina hit, Heart to Heart was one of the first humanitarian organizations to be down in the Gulf Coast. For several weeks and months after the hurricane hit, free medical clinics were operated throughout the region. At the local clinics, there continues to be around 100 people served a day.
 Heart to Heart International recently purchased a prototype, state-of-the-art mobile medical clinic, fully furnished to expand into a modern medical clinic on wheels. As soon as the fabrication for the mobile medical clinic was finished, it was sent down to assist victims of Hurricane Katrina. It continues to serve there to this day.
 When the 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck the province of Sichuan, China, Heart to Heart was one of the first foreign NGOs to respond.  An emergency operations command center was set up in the provincial capital of Chengdu and has been the heart of relief efforts in the affected areas.  The main goal of Heart to Heart during this time is finding and filling needs in a way that opens doors for long-term cooperative engagement leading to rebuilding lives and communities.  After initial efforts of search and rescue and general medical relief, Heart to Heart has begun to look to the long-term task of rebuilding the area around Chengdu.
 On October 25, 2005, Heart to Heart International in a partnership with Physicians with Heart Airlifts delivered over $8 million worth of medical supplies.
 During the month of October, 2002, Heart to Heart International partnered again with Physicians with Heart Airlifts to airlift around $10 million worth of pharmaceuticals to hospitals in need. After the airlift was completed, there was a commemoration service for the work that had been accomplished in this country."
Heifer International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heifer_International	"Heifer International (also known as Heifer Project International) is a global nonprofit working to eradicate poverty and hunger through sustainable, values-based holistic community development.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] Heifer distributes animals, along with agricultural and values-based training, to families in need around the world as a means of providing self-sufficiency. Recipients must agree to ""pass on the gift"" by sharing animal offspring, as well as the skills and knowledge of animal husbandry and agricultural training with other impoverished families.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15]
 Based in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States, Heifer International started with a shipment of 17 heifers to Puerto Rico in 1944.[16][17][18][19][20] Since 1944, Heifer International has distributed livestock such as goats, bees, and water buffalo, along with training and other resources, to 20.7 million families, or more than 105.1 million people in more than 125 countries.[16][17][18][19][20]
 Heifer International began as Heifers for Relief in 1944.[16][17][18][19][20] Its founder, an Ohio farmer named Dan West, was a Church of the Brethren relief worker during the Spanish Civil War. Working with Quakers and Mennonites, West directed a program where hungry children were given rations of milk.[18][19][20] In 1938, West was ladling out milk to hungry refugee children and wrote later that he thought, ""These children don't need a cup, they need a cow.""[16][17][18][19][20]
 When back home in Indiana, West took the idea to his neighbors and church. This led to the formation of the Heifers for Relief Committee in 1939.[16][17][18][19][20] In 1942, West was approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to pursue the idea as a national project.[16][17][18][19][20] The charity was incorporated in 1944 and sent its first shipment of 17 heifers to Puerto Rico. Several local farmers who knew West donated the animals.[16][17][18][19][20]
 The first cows were named, ""Faith,"" ""Hope,"" and ""Charity,"" and recipient families had to promise that they would donate the first female calf to another poor family.[16][17][18][19][20] West asked farmers and church leaders to donate pregnant dairy cows due to calve soon so that impoverished families could have milk for years to come and not have to worry about breeding the cows.[16][17] Heifer International would eventually broaden its scope to distribute fish, chickens, pigs, goats, sheep, cattle, oxen, water buffaloes, bees, llamas, alpacas, camels, frogs and rabbits to poor rural communities around the world.[16][17][18][19][20]
 Heifer International's first paid employee was Thurl Metzger, a member of the Church of the Brethren who started as an unpaid volunteer and served as executive director/program director and director of international programs of Heifer International for 30 years.[16][21][22][23][24] Metzger started his tenure as a seagoing cowboy. Seagoing cowboys volunteered to accompany the animals to their overseas destinations.[16][19] From 1951 to 1981, Metzger served as the executive director and director of international programs of the nonprofit and diversified the program's offerings as well as the geographic regions Heifer International was serving.[16][21][22][23][24] Eventually Metzger guided Heifer to work in developing nations instead of war-torn regions.[16]
 In the early 1970s, Heifer consolidated its U.S. distribution network by buying several large farms, including a 1,200-acre ranch in Perryville, Arkansas, as livestock holding facilities.[16] The organization moved its headquarters to Little Rock, near the Perryville ranch, in 1971. Livestock are now sourced from within country or regionally.
 In 1992, Heifer International appointed Jo Luck to its helm as CEO.[16] Jo Luck is a former member of Bill Clinton's Arkansas gubernatorial cabinet. Before serving as CEO and President, Luck was the Director of International Programs for Heifer International.[16] Heifer International's budget boomed to almost $100 million under Jo Luck's leadership.
 In 2008, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded Heifer International a $42.5 million grant to help poor rural farmers in East Africa double their incomes by increasing their production of high quality raw milk to sell to dairies. In 2012, the Foundation followed up with an additional $8.2 million.[25][26][27]
 In 2010, Pierre U. Ferrari was named CEO of Heifer International. Ferrari became president and CEO after Jo Luck's retirement.
 Passing on the Gift is part of Heifer International's charitable model. The nonprofit grounds all of its projects in its 12 Cornerstones of Just and Sustainable Development.
 As of 2018, Charity Navigator scored Heifer International as a 3-star (out of four) charity with 84.71 points out of 100. Heifer International's financial performance was rated 2-star while its transparency and accountability was rated 4-star. Based on the income statement for financial year 2017, Charity Navigator showed Heifer's non-program expenses (for administration, fundraising, and liabilities) as accounting for 23.8%, and program expenses for 76.2% of its total expenses.[28]
 GiveWell notes that while Heifer International is ""commonly perceived as a way to 'give a cow to a poor family as a gift' ... this is in fact a donor illusion – donations support Heifer International's general 'agricultural assistance' activities.""[29] The organization delineates concerns about the efficacy of agricultural assistance programs in general, and, specifically, those that involve gifts of livestock, stating, in conclusion: ""Neither Heifer's website nor its grant application have provided the kind of information needed to address these concerns.""[29]
 In 1986, President Ronald Reagan recognized Heifer with the Volunteer Action Award and in 1990 President George H.W. Bush granted the organization the Presidential End Hunger Award.[8][16]
 In 2003, Heifer International was named one of Forbes magazine's top 10 charities.[30]
 Heifer International also received the 2004 Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize for its efforts to eliminate hunger and help communities become self-sustaining.  It was the first U.S.-based organization to win the $1-million award since 1997.[31]
 Heifer International received the 2006 and 2008 Social Capitalist award from Fast Company magazine.[32][33]
 In 2007, the Heifer International Headquarters building was named one of the American Institute of Architects Committee on the Environment Top Ten Green Projects.[34]
 In 2008, the Heifer International Headquarters building was named a National AIA (American Institute of Architects) Institute Honor Award Winner.[34]
 In 2010, Heifer International President Jo Luck was named a co-laureate of the World Food Prize with David Beckmann of Bread for the World.[35]
 In 2012, Heifer received Kiwanis International World Service Medal.[36]
 The American Institute of Philanthropy gave Heifer International an ""Open Book Credit"" for making complete financial documentation available on request.[37]
 The Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance (WGA) reports that Heifer International meets all of its standards for charity accountability.[38] The WGA found that Heifer International is truthful in its representations of how money is spent, does not allocate an excessive part of its budget for fundraising or administrative expenses and makes its financial statements readily available to the public.[38]
 The Charity Navigator rates Heifer International with 78.72 out of 100, a combined score of Heifer's 70.06 for financial and 97.00 for accountability and transparency performance.[39]"
Helen Keller International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller_International	"Helen Keller International (HKI) combats the causes and consequences of blindness and malnutrition by establishing programs based on evidence and research in vision, health and nutrition. Founded in 1915 by Helen Keller and George A. Kessler, the organization's mission is to save the sight and lives of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.
 George A. Kessler, also known as the ""Champagne King,"" was a passenger on the RMS Lusitania in 1915 when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat. When he was fighting for his life in the cold waters of the Atlantic off the coast of Ireland, he vowed that if he survived, he would devote much of his time and substantial financial resources to a worthwhile cause.  The cause he chose was assisting Allied soldiers blinded in the service.  He later befriended Helen Keller and helped found the organization that became Helen Keller International.
 HKI's two major areas of expertise are Eye Health and Nutrition.  Its Eye Health programs address the major causes of blindness in the world, including cataract, trachoma and onchocerciasis, and treating refractive error. Its nutrition programs include vitamin A, iron/folate, and multi-micronutrient supplementation, fortification of commonly used foods, dietary diversification, community- and school-gardening as well as school health activities, the promotion of breastfeeding and complementary feeding, and nutritional surveillance to provide critical data to governments and other development partners. Each year, HKI's programs benefit millions of people.
 Currently, HKI works in 21 countries around the world in Africa, Asia and the United States.  Global headquarters are located in New York City, and programs are also developed and administered through  regional offices, currently located in Senegal and Phnom Penh, as well as through 19 country offices and an additional development office in Paris. HKI has country offices in Burkina Faso, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Cambodia, Côte d'Ivoire, China, Guinea, Indonesia, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Vietnam.
 Helen Keller International has received the 2014 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Development Cooperation category for agricultural programs that help families and villages to raise their own nutritious foods. ""Hunger and low dietary diversity reduce cognitive function, physical capacity, resistance to disease and quality of life and lifetime earnings. Heller Keller International champions Homestead Food Production, an innovative, interdisciplinary program that promotes improved agricultural and nutritional practices in a synergistic fashion. This approach is mostly applied to communities that have difficult access to labor and food markets,"" in the words of the jury's citation.
 Helen Keller International has launched and completed several initiatives to combat malnutrition and blindness in Bangladesh.
 This programme was started by HKI in 1990 to monitor the health impact of severe flooding in Bangladesh. It is a collaborative effort which involves the Government of Bangladesh (GOB), international and local Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO).[1] The programme essentially provides up-to-date and dependable information on the prevalence of malnutrition and morbidity in children, household socioeconomic characteristics and food prices. Data are collected by authorities in selected rural districts and urban slums in the country.[2] The NSP data have also been used by the GOB to improve or develop nutrition and health programmes such as the national vitamin A capsule distribution program.[3] NSP has proven to be an excellent tool to aid long-term planning in health policies, to provide input for programme management and evaluation and to give timely warning of the need for intervention to prevent critical deterioration in food consumption.
 Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness. Heller Keller International helps prepare health care systems to identify and treat Diabetic Retinopathy. In collaboration with Chittagong Eye Infirmary and Training Complex and the Diabetes Association of Bangladesh, HKI began a pilot project in 2009 to improve patients' access to sight-saving Diabetic Retinopathy treatment regardless of their ability to pay.[4]
 This programme aims to reduce malnutrition and increase food availability through creation of home gardens and small farms for raising livestock. In collaboration with local NGOs, HKI provides the seedlings, chicks, start up materials and technical skills to communities. Varieties of fruits and vegetables are grown in these home gardens to provide supplies of nutrient rich foods all year round. The objectives are to increase participants' micro-nutritional intakes by consuming a wider variety of foods, develop communities and empower women.
 HFP started in 1990 as a pilot project in Bangladesh with 1000 households participating. It includes nutrition education to complement home gardening. Following initial success, HKI launched the NGO Gardening and Nutrition Education Surveillance Project (NGNESP) which expanded the programme to communities across the country in 1993.[5] By 2012, 900,000 households and 4.5 million people are participating in the project, with the help of 52 local NGOs.[6] Women organise 90% of the gardens.
 A 2002 research shows that in a 3 months period, households participating in the HFP consumed had a daily per capita consumption of vegetables of 160g, more than double of the 71g for non-participating households.[7]
 Vitamin A deficiency causes blindness and increases mortality rate for young children and women. The deficiency can be prevented with two doses of high potency Vitamin A capsules every year. With the cost of providing the capsules at $1 per person per year, Vitamin A supplementation is a cost-efficient initiative.[8]
 HKI started the Vitamin A supplementation project in Bangladesh in 1978. Its partnership with the GOB began in 1982. The Bangladesh Nutritional Blindness Study was conducted, and it indicated that there was a high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency. By 2005, Vitamin A deficiency among children 12 to 59 months, as measured by prevalence of night blindness, has decreased to 0.04% from 3.76% in 1982.[9]
 Kathy Spahn is President and Chief Executive Officer, joining in March 2005. Prior to HKI, Ms. Spahn was President and Executive Director of Orbis, a global non-profit organization dedicated to the prevention and treatment of blindness in the developing world.[10]
 Helen Keller International is a partner in Compact2025, a partnership that develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025. HKI is represented on the Leadership Council of Compact2025 by its president Kathy Spahn.[11]"
Heritage Action	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_Action	"Heritage Action for America, more commonly known simply as Heritage Action, is a conservative policy advocacy organization founded in 2010.[1] Heritage Action, which has affiliates throughout the United States,[2][3] is a sister organization of the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation.[3][4] Heritage Action has been called a ""powerhouse in a new generation of conservative groups""[5] and ""perhaps now the most influential lobby group among Congressional Republicans.""[6] The organization has been led by executive director Tim Chapman since May 2018.[7]
 Heritage Action was first announced in April 2010 by Ed Feulner, president of The Heritage Foundation. He stated the purpose of the organization was to harness ""grassroots energy to increase the pressure on Members of Congress to embrace The Heritage Foundation’s policy recommendations."" He also said it would not be involved in election campaigns.[8]
Heritage Action's goal was to expand the political reach of The Heritage Foundation and advance the policies recommended by its researchers.[9]
 The organization was launched primarily as a response to The Heritage Foundation's growing membership, and the fact that The Heritage Foundation is not allowed to back legislation due to its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. Heritage Action fulfills this role and provides a link between the think tank and grassroots conservative activists.[10]
 Officials at The Heritage Foundation began engaging in political advocacy following the March 2010 passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[9][11] As a 501(c)3 organization, the think tank cannot engage in direct lobbying, so it created Heritage Action to serve as its lobbying and advocacy arm.[12]
 Heritage Action began with a staff of ten, including original chief executive officer Michael A. Needham and Timothy Chapman.[13][14] Chapman become executive director in May 2018[15] following Needham's taking a chief of staff position for Senator Marco Rubio[16] in April. Chapman had previously served as Heritage Action's chief operating officer and as chief of staff to Heritage Foundation President Ed J. Feulner. Jessica Anderson, formerly employed at the Office of Management and Budget, took over the Vice President roll from Dan Holler in June, 2018.[17]
 Heritage Action launched its first advocacy campaign in July 2010, targeting Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), President Barack Obama's health care reform law.[10] By August 2010 the organization had helped to secure 170 Republican co-sponsors for a petition by Rep. Steve King to force a vote on repealing the healthcare reform.[18] Following this, in September 2010, the group began a 10-day television and web campaign to persuade Democrats to sign onto a repeal of the law.[19] The group opened its state operations in North Carolina and Pennsylvania in January 2011, specifically to focus on mobilizing voters against the health care law.[20]
 Heritage Action for America previously produced the radio show Istook Live!, hosted by former Oklahoma congressman Ernest Istook.[21][22]
 Heritage Action launched a campaign in August 2013 to link the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as the ACA or ""Obamacare"", with laws to keep the federal government open or to increase the federal debt limit.[23] The organization played an instrumental role in the government shutdown of October 2013.[24][25] While the shutdown was ongoing Heritage Action continued to urge lawmakers not to negotiate a measure to fully fund the government without dismantling the ACA.[23] The strategy of Heritage Action in tying the ACA to the shutdown, according to then-CEO Michael Needham, was to make President Obama ""feel pain"" because of the shutdown.[26] Senator Orrin Hatch criticized Heritage for warning legislators not to vote for the Senate budget compromise during the government shutdown.[27]
 On July 19, 2015, Heritage Action's then-CEO Michael A. Needham publicly criticized then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying ""Donald Trump's a clown. He needs to be out of the race"" on Fox News Sunday.[28] On September 18, 2015, Trump cancelled his scheduled appearance at Heritage Action's candidate forum in Greenville, South Carolina, citing a ""significant business transaction.""[29] Then on November 22, 2015, Needham publicly praised Trump. ""I think that part of Donald Trump's attraction is that he's provided bold leadership,"" Needham said on Fox News Sunday. ""I think Trump is driven by people who want bold leadership.""[30] Trump publicly thanked Needham the following day, tweeting ""Thank you for your nice words @MikeNeedham...”[31] According to a  March 8, 2016, article in The Washington Post, Needham said ""A Trump election or nomination is a complete vindication that Washington needs to change.""[32]
 Heritage Action committed to spending $2.5 million on election advertising to support Republican Congressional candidates in the 2018 House of Representatives elections.[33]
 Heritage Action is supported by individual and corporate donors, with its 2012 tax return indicating that 44 percent of its overall contributions came from donations of $5,000 or less that year.[34] At a Christian Science Monitor breakfast in October 2013, Needham stated that Heritage Action was ""not being transparent"" with their donors. They have generally declined to disclose who their donors are.[35] One exception to this was a donation from conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch; the Koch brothers donated half a million dollars in October 2013.[35]"
The Heritage Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation	"The Heritage Foundation (abbreviated to Heritage)[1][2] is an American conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C., primarily geared towards public policy. The foundation took a leading role in the conservative movement during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, whose policies were taken from Heritage's policy study Mandate for Leadership.[4] Since then, The Heritage Foundation has continued to have a significant influence in U.S. public policy making, and is considered to be one of the most influential conservative public policy organizations in the United States.
 The Heritage Foundation was founded on February 16, 1973 by Paul Weyrich, Edwin Feulner, and Joseph Coors.[5][6] Growing out of the new business activist movement inspired by the Powell Memorandum,[7][8] discontent with Richard Nixon's embrace of the ""liberal consensus"" and the nonpolemical, cautious nature of existing think tanks,[9] Weyrich and Feulner sought to create a version of the Brookings Institution that advanced conservative activism.[5] Coors was the primary funder of the Heritage Foundation in its early years.[5]  Weyrich was its first president. Later, under president Frank J. Walton, the Heritage Foundation began using direct mail fundraising and Heritage's annual income grew to $1 million per year in 1976.[10] By 1981, the annual budget grew to $5.3 million.[5]
 Heritage advocated for pro-business policies, anti-communism and neoconservatism in its early years, but distinguished itself from the conservative American Enterprise Institute (AEI) by also advocating for Christian conservatism.[5] Through the 1970s, Heritage would remain small relative to Brookings and the AEI.[5]
 In January 1981, Heritage published the Mandate for Leadership, a comprehensive report aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, providing public policy guidance to the incoming Reagan administration, including more than 2,000 specific suggestions to move the federal government in a conservative direction. The report was well received by the White House, and several of its authors went on to take positions in the Reagan administration.[11] Reagan liked the ideas so much that he gave a copy to each member of his cabinet to review.[12] Approximately 60% of the 2,000 proposals were implemented or initiated by the end of Reagan's first year in office.[11][13] Ronald Reagan later said that the Heritage Foundation played a ""vital force"" in the successes during his presidency.[12]
 Heritage was influential in developing and advancing of the so-called ""Reagan Doctrine,"" a Reagan administration foreign policy initiative in which the U.S. provided military and other support to anti-communist resistance movements fighting Soviet-aligned governments in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Nicaragua and other nations during the final years of the Cold War.[14]
 Heritage also advocated the development of new ballistic missile defense systems for the United States. Reagan adopted this as his top defense priority in 1983, calling it the Strategic Defense Initiative.[11] By mid-decade, The Heritage Foundation had emerged as a key organization in the national conservative movement, publishing influential reports on domestic and defense issues, as well as pieces by prominent conservative figures, such as Bob Dole and Pat Robertson.[15] In 1986, Time Magazine called Heritage ""the foremost of the new breed of advocacy tanks"".[16] During the Reagan and Bush administrations, The Heritage Foundation served as the President's brain trust on foreign policy.[17]
 The Heritage Foundation remained an influential voice on domestic and foreign policy issues during President George H. W. Bush's administration. It was a leading proponent of Operation Desert Storm against Iraq, and – according to Frank Starr, head of the Baltimore Sun's Washington bureau – the foundation's studies ""laid much of the groundwork for Bush administration thinking"" about post-Soviet foreign policy.[18] In domestic policy, the Bush administration agreed with six of the ten budget reforms contained in Mandate for Leadership III and included them in their 1990 budget proposal. Heritage also became involved in the culture wars of the 1990s with the publication of ""The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators"" by William Bennett. The Index documented how crime, illegitimacy, divorce, teenage suicide, drug use and fourteen other social indicators had become measurably worse since the 1960s.[19]
 Heritage continued to grow throughout the 1990s and its journal, Policy Review, hit an all-time-high circulation of 23,000. Heritage was an opponent of the Clinton health care plan of 1993. President Clinton's welfare reforms were analogous with Heritage's recommendations and were adopted in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996. In 1995, Heritage published the first Index of Economic Freedom, co-authored by policy analyst Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy. In 1997, the Index became a joint project between the Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal.[19]
 In 1994, Heritage advised Newt Gingrich and other conservatives on the development of the ""Contract with America"", which was credited with helping to produce a Republican majority in Congress. The ""Contract"" was a pact of principles that directly challenged both the political status-quo in Washington and many of the ideas at the heart of the Clinton administration.
 The Heritage Foundation supported the War in Afghanistan and the War in Iraq.[20][21] According to a 2004 study in the journal International Security, the Heritage Foundation confused public debate by challenging widespread opposition to the Iraq War by international relations scholars and experts by contradicting them ""with experts of apparently equal authority... this undermined the possibility that any criticisms [of the war] might be seen as authoritative or have much persuasive effect.""[22] The organization defended the Bush administration's Guantanamo Bay practices.[20]
 In 2005, The Washington Post criticized the Heritage Foundation for softening its criticism of Malaysia following a business relationship between Heritage's president and Malaysia's prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. The Heritage Foundation denied any conflict of interest, stating its views on Malaysia changed following the country's cooperation with the U.S. after the September 11 attacks in 2001,[23] and changes by Malaysia ""moving in the right economic and political direction."" [24][25]
 The health insurance mandate in the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is an idea hatched in 1989 by Stuart Butler at Heritage in a publication titled ""Assuring Affordable Health Care for All Americans"".[26] This was also the model for Mitt Romney's health care plan in Massachusetts.[27]
 In December 2012, an announcement was made that Senator Jim DeMint would resign from the Senate to head the Heritage Foundation.[28] Pundits predicted his tenure would bring a sharper, more politicized edge to the Foundation.[29] DeMint's eventual ouster in 2017 led some, such as Mickey Edwards (R-Okla.), to believe Heritage sought to pare back its partisan edge and restore its reputation as a pioneering think tank.[30]
 On May 10, 2013, Jason Richwine, who co-authored the think tank's controversial report on the costs of amnesty, resigned his position following intensive media attention on his Harvard PhD thesis from 2009 and comments he made at a 2008 American Enterprise Institute forum. Richwine argued that Hispanics and blacks are intellectually inferior to whites and have trouble assimilating because of a supposed genetic predisposition to lower IQ.[31][32]
 A 2011 study on poverty in America[33] was criticized for what critics called an overly narrow definition of poverty. Criticism was published in opinion editorials in The New Republic, The Nation, the Center for American Progress, and The Washington Post.[34][35][36][37]
 A 2013 study by Heritage senior fellow Robert Rector on the 2013 Senate Immigration Bill (Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013) was criticized for its methodology by critics from across the political spectrum.[38] Notably, outlets like Reason magazine and the Cato Institute criticized the report for failing to employ dynamic scoring despite Heritage's support for such methodology in analyzing other policy proposals.[39] The study was also criticized because its co-author, Jason Richwine, said in his 2009 doctoral dissertation that immigrants' IQs should be considered when crafting public policy.[40]
 In July 2013, following disputes over the farm bill, the Republican Study Committee of 172 conservative U.S. House members reversed a decades-old tradition of access by barring Heritage Foundation employees from attending its weekly meeting in the Capitol, but continues cooperation through ""regular joint events and briefings"".[41]
 In September 2015, the Foundation stated publicly that it had been targeted by hackers and had experienced a breach in which donors' information was taken. The Hill publication compared the attack to another notable data breach at the Office of Personnel Management a few months before. The identity of those that attacked the Foundation and their motivations are unknown.[42]
 The Heritage Foundation has been described as a major influence on the presidential transition of Donald Trump and the Trump administration.[43][44][45] The foundation had a powerful say in the staffing of the administration, with CNN noting during the transition that ""no other Washington institution has that kind of footprint in the transition.""[43] One reason for the Heritage Foundation's disproportionate influence relative to other conservative think tanks is that other conservative think tanks had members who identified as ""never-Trumpers"" during the 2016 election whereas the Heritage Foundation signaled early on to Trump that it would be supportive of him.[43][44]
 
In 2014, the Heritage Foundation began building a database of approximately 3,000 conservatives who they trusted to serve in a hypothetical Republican administration for the upcoming 2016 election.[44] According to individuals involved in crafting the database, several hundred people from the Heritage database ultimately received jobs in the Trump administration.[44][need quotation to verify] At least 66 foundation employees and alumni got positions in the administration.[44] The foundation also recommended cabinet members Scott Pruitt, Betsy DeVos, Mick Mulvaney, Rick Perry, and Jeff Sessions.[44] Heritage head Jim DeMint personally intervened on behalf of Mulvaney, who would go on to head the Office of Management and Budget, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and later become acting White House Chief of Staff.[44] The Heritage Foundation has regularly ranked as one of the world's most influential think tanks. The 2016 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report published by the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania ranks Heritage 12th among ""Top Think Tanks Worldwide"" and seventh among ""Top Think Tanks in the United States"".[46] Several Heritage Foundation personnel have served, or gone on to serve, in senior governmental roles, including: Richard V.

 Heritage published a 1981 book of policy analysis, Mandate for Leadership, which offered specific recommendations on policy, budget and administrative action for all Cabinet departments. The Heritage Foundation also publishes The Insider, a quarterly magazine about public policy. Until 2001, the Heritage Foundation published Policy Review, a public policy journal, which was then acquired by the Hoover Institution. From 1995 to 2005, the Heritage Foundation ran Townhall.com, a conservative website that was subsequently acquired by Camarillo, California-based Salem Communications.[48] In 2005, the Foundation published The Heritage Guide to the Constitution, a clause-by-clause analysis of the United States Constitution. Once per year Heritage publishes its Budget Chart Book using visual graphs and charts to demonstrate the growth of federal spending, revenue, debt and deficits, and entitlement programs.[49][50]
 Under Jim DeMint's leadership, the process involved in publishing policy papers changed at the Heritage Foundation.[44] Whereas previous senior staff reviewed policy papers by staff, DeMint and his team heavily edited policy papers or shelved them.[44] In response to this, several scholars at the foundation quit.[44]
 Internationally, Heritage publishes the annual Index of Economic Freedom, which measures a country's freedom in terms of property rights and freedom from government regulation. The factors used to calculate the Index score are corruption in government, barriers to international trade, income tax and corporate tax rates, government expenditures, rule of law and the ability to enforce contracts, regulatory burdens, banking restrictions, labor regulations, and black market activities. A British-born academic, Charles W. L. Hill, after discussing the international shift toward a market-based economic system and Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom, said ""given that the Heritage Foundation has a political agenda, its work should be viewed with caution.""[51]
 In 2002, Heritage began publishing its annual Index of Dependence report on the growth of federal government programs that constrain private sector or local government alternatives and impact the dependence of individuals on the federal government. It examines programs in five broad categories: housing; health care and welfare; retirement; higher education; and rural and agricultural services.[52] The report has found that each year the number of Americans who pay nothing in federal personal income taxes continues to increase, while there is a simultaneous increase in the number who rely on government services.[53] The 2010 report found that Americans' dependence on government grew by 13.6% in 2009 during the worst U.S. economic crisis since the Great Depression. According to Heritage, this is the biggest increase since 1976 and the fifth largest going back to 1962, when the foundation began tracking dependence.[52] The report stated that in the previous eight years, the index of government dependence has grown by almost 33 percent.[54]
 Until 2014, the Heritage Foundation published a blog, The Foundry. In 2014, The Foundry was phased out and replaced with The Daily Signal.[55][56] Since 2006, the Foundation has hosted ""The Bloggers Briefing"", a meeting of conservative and independent bloggers organized by Robert Bluey.[57]
 In 2009, Heritage produced 33 Minutes, a one-hour documentary film about the foreign policy challenges facing the United States.[58][59]
 In 2005, Heritage established the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom in honor of the former British Prime Minister.[60] Thatcher herself maintained a long relationship with The Heritage Foundation. Shortly after leaving office, Thatcher was honored by Heritage at a September 1991 dinner.[61] Seven years later, Thatcher delivered the keynote address during Heritage's 25th anniversary celebration.[62] In 2002, Thatcher was again honored by Heritage as the recipient of its annual Clare Boothe Luce Award.[63] Thatcher was later named Patron of the Heritage Foundation, her only official association with any U.S.-based group.[64]
 The Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) co-hosted one of the 2012 Republican Party presidential debates on foreign policy and national defense.on November 22, 2011.[65] It was the first presidential debate to be sponsored by either Heritage or AEI.[66][67] During the debate, Heritage fellows Edwin Meese and David Addington were among those who questioned candidates on policy.[68] The debate was praised by The New York Times for putting ""pressure on candidates to show their policy expertise"".[68] According to conservative commentator Michael Barone, the debate was ""probably the most substantive and serious presidential debate of this election cycle.""[69]
 The Heritage Foundation is an associate member of the State Policy Network.[70][71]
 The Heritage Foundation rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[72] The Heritage Foundation is one of many climate change denial organization that has been funded by ExxonMobil.[72][73] The Heritage Foundation strongly criticized the Kyoto Agreement, which was intended to curb climate change, saying American participation in the treaty would ""result in lower economic growth in every state and nearly every sector of the economy.""[74] The Heritage Foundation projected that the 2009 cap-and-trade bill, the American Clean Energy and Security Act, would result in a cost of $1,870 per family in 2025 and $6,800 by 2035; on the other hand, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projected that it would only cost the average family $175 in 2020.
 In 1973, businessman Joseph Coors contributed $250,000 to establish The Heritage Foundation and continued to fund it through the Adolph Coors Foundation.[75][76] In 1973, it had trustees from Chase Manhattan Bank, Dow Chemical, General Motors, Pfizer, Sears and Mobil.[77]
 Heritage is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization as well as a BBB Wise Giving Alliance accredited charity funded by donations from private individuals, corporations and charitable foundations.[78][79][80] As a 501(c)(3), Heritage is not required to disclose its donors and donations to the foundation are tax-deductible.[79] According to a MediaTransparency report in 2006, donors have included John M. Olin Foundation, the Castle Rock Foundation, the Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation and the Bradley Foundation.[81][unreliable source?][importance?] Other financing as of 2016 includes $28,129,000 from the combined Scaife Foundations of the late billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife.[82][83] Heritage is a grantee of the Donors Trust, a nonprofit donor-advised fund.[84][85][importance?][86] As of 2010, Heritage reported 710,000 supporters.[87]
 For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011, Charity Watch reported that Edwin Feulner, past president of The Heritage Foundation, received the highest compensation in its top 25 list of compensation received by charity members. According to Charity Watch, Feulner received $2,702,687 in 2013. This sum includes investment earnings of $1,656,230 accrued over a period of 33 years.[88]
 Heritage's total revenue for 2011 was $72,170,983 and its expenses were $80,033,828.[89][90]
 The Heritage Foundation was mentioned periodically in the NBC fictional television series The West Wing.  The character Patricia Calhoun, a former member of the Office of Management and Budget and a Republican appointee to the Federal Election Commission in the fictional Bartlet administration, is identified as the former Director of the Roe Institute for Economic Policy at The Heritage Foundation.  Calhoun is depicted in the series as an aggressive advocate of campaign finance reform.[91] This is not a focus of the modern Foundation which has endorsed controversial Citizens United effectively removing such controls.

Holt International Children's Services	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holt_International_Children%27s_Services	"Holt International Children's Services (HICS) is a faith-based humanitarian organization and adoption agency based in Eugene, Oregon, United States, known for international adoption and child welfare. The nonprofit works in thirteen countries, including: Cambodia, China, Colombia, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Mongolia, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Uganda, Vietnam, and the United States.[2] This work includes a range of services for children and families including efforts in nutrition, education, family strengthening, orphan care, foster care, family reunification, and child sponsorship.[3] The organization's stated mission is to seek a world where every child has a loving and secure home.[4]
 In 1954, Harry (1904–1964) and Bertha Holt (1904–2000) were busy raising their six children on a farm near the small Willamette Valley city of Creswell. In addition to farming, Harry ran a lumber company. Bertha, trained as a nurse, was a homemaker and mother.[5]
 After seeing a documentary film about ""G.I. babies"" of the Korean War in orphanages in Korea, the Holts decided they would adopt some of the children who needed families.[6] Harry began preparations to go to Korea, and Bertha asked a friend how to go about adopting eight children from another country. Learning that it would be possible only if both houses of Congress passed a law allowing it, Bertha Holt decided to push for such a law.[7]
 Two months later, the ""Holt Bill"" was passed, and in October 1955, Harry Holt and eight children arrived at Portland International Airport. The resulting publicity stirred interest among many families in the United States. The Holts set about helping others to adopt, leading to the creation of the foundation.
 In the year 2000,[8] Bertha Holt was awarded the Kellogg's Child Development Award from the World of Children Award for her work with the Holt International Children's Services."
Howard Hughes Medical Institute	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes_Medical_Institute	"The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) is an American non-profit medical research organization based in Chevy Chase, Maryland.[2][3] It was founded by the American businessman Howard Hughes in 1953. It is one of the largest private funding organizations for biological and medical research in the United States. HHMI spends about $1 million per HHMI Investigator per year, which amounts to annual investment in biomedical research of about $825 million. 
 The institute has an endowment of $22.6 billion, making it the second-wealthiest philanthropic organization in the United States and the second-best endowed medical research foundation in the world.[4]  HHMI is the former owner of the Hughes Aircraft Company - an American aerospace firm which was divested to various firms over time.
 The institute was formed with the goal of basic research including trying to understand, in Hughes's words, ""the genesis of life itself."" Despite its principles, in the early days it was generally viewed as a tax haven for Hughes's huge personal fortune. Hughes was HHMI's sole trustee and transferred his stock of Hughes Aircraft to the institute, in effect turning the large defense contractor into a tax-exempt charity. For many years the Institute grappled with maintaining its non-profit status; the Internal Revenue Service challenged its ""charitable"" status which made it tax exempt. Partly in response to such claims, starting in the late 1950s it began funding 47 investigators researching at eight different institutions; however, it remained a modest enterprise for several decades.
 The institute was initially in Miami, Florida, in 1953. Hughes's internist, Verne Mason, who treated Hughes after his 1946 plane crash, was chairman of the institute's medical advisory committee.[5]  By 1975, Hughes was sole trustee of the Howard Hughes medical Institute, which in turn owned all the stock of the Hughes Aircraft Company.[6] In 1969, Representative Wright Patman ""complained that the Hughes foundation was a tax‐evasion device,"" noting that the institute spent only $5.7 million for its operations between 1954 and 1961, a period during which Hughes Aircraft accumulated $76.9 million in profits. By 1975, it had also avoided certain stipulations of the 1969 reform act for charitable institutions due to legal filings by Hughes to change its operational status, with his objections going directly to the White House.[7]
 The institute moved to Coconut Grove, Florida, in the mid-1970s and then to Bethesda, Maryland, in 1976.[8] In 1993 the institute moved to its headquarters in Chevy Chase, Maryland.[9]
 It was not until after Hughes's death in 1976 that the institute's profile increased from an annual budget of $4 million in 1975 to $15 million in 1978 and prior to Hughes Aircraft sale the number had peaked to $200 million per year. At the time of the sale Hughes Aircraft employed 75,000 people and vast amounts of money from the approximate annual revenue of $6 billion were put into Hughes Aircraft internal research and development rather than the medical institute. Most of the money for the medical institute came from the operations at Ground System Group responsible for providing Air Defense Systems to NATO, Pacific Rim, and the USA. In this period it focused its mission on genetics, immunology, and molecular biology. Since Hughes died without a will as the sole trustee of the HHMI, the institute was involved in lengthy court proceedings to determine whether it would benefit from Hughes's fortune. In April 1984, a court appointed new trustees for the institute's holdings.[10] In January 1985 the trustees announced they would sell Hughes Aircraft by private sale or public stock offering. On June 5, 1985 General Motors (GM) was announced as the winner of a secretive five-month, sealed-bid auction. The purchase was completed on December 20, 1985, for an estimated $5.2 billion, $2.7 billion in cash and the rest in 50 million shares of GM Class H stock. The proceeds caused the institute to grow dramatically.
 HHMI completed the building of a new research campus in Ashburn, Virginia called Janelia Research Campus in October 2006. It is modeled after AT&T's Bell Labs and the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology. With a main laboratory building nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) long, it contains 760,000 square feet (71,000 m2) of enclosed space, used primarily for research. The campus also features apartments for visiting researchers.
 In 2007, HHMI and the publisher Elsevier announced they have established an agreement to make author manuscripts of HHMI research articles published in Elsevier and Cell Press journals publicly available six months following final publication. The agreement takes effect for articles published after September 1, 2007. In 2008, the Trustees of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute selected Robert Tjian as the new president of HHMI. In 2009, HHMI awarded fifty researchers, as part of the HHMI Early Career Scientist Competition. In 2016, the HHMI Trustees selected Erin K. O'Shea, a previous Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at the institute, the new president of HHMI.[11]
 In 2014, the institute created a new round of its primary award competition, for a total of $150 million in award money from 2015 to 2012.[12] The institute is adding another campus in 2019.[13]
 As of 2017[update] the Howard Hughes Medical Institute had assets of $22,588,928,000.

Humanity & Inclusion	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanity_%26_Inclusion	"Claude Simonnot
 Humanity & Inclusion (formerly Handicap International[1][note 1]) is an international non-governmental organization. It was founded in 1982 to provide help in refugee camps in Cambodia and Thailand. Headquartered in France and Belgium, since its creation, it has opened branches in six other countries : Switzerland, Luxembourg, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and the United States.
 It is an organization which aims to help disabled and vulnerable people in situations of poverty and exclusion, conflict and disaster.[2] More than 3,500 field staff are currently located in more than 60 countries worldwide.[2]
 The organization was founded in France by two French doctors in 1982 to help people affected by landmines in Cambodian refugee camps.[3] The first orthopedic centers were set up in refugee camps in Thailand, Cambodia, Burma and Laos. Simple, locally available equipment was used to provide immediate, effective and practical aid, and local teams carried out the work. In 1986, Handicap International Belgium was set up, and the organization began to extend its work to other countries.
 It is one of the 6 founding members of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines which received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997.[4] Since February 2005, the organization has also been calling for a ban on cluster munitions and conducting research documenting the human impact of these weapons. Humanity & Inclusion is a founding member of the Cluster Munition Coalition, an international civil society campaign that works to erase the production and storage of all the munition.[5] In February 2006, Belgium became the first country to enact such a ban as a result of Handicap International's public awareness and advocacy efforts.[6] Handicap International has been a vocal advocate of the Convention on Cluster Munitions(CCM), an international treaty banning the use, transfer and stockpile of these weapons adopted on 30 May 2008 in Dublin, Ireland. There are currently 68 states that have ratified the CCM and 43 non-ratifying signatories.[7]
 Humanity & Inclusion won the prize of the 2011 Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize, a $1.5 million prize, for its commitment to disabled people living in situations of poverty, exclusion, conflict or natural disasters. It is also a member organization of the International Disability and Development Consortium.
 The Brazilian football player Neymar Jr. became an ""ambassador"" of Humanity & Inclusion on 15 August 2017.
 The organization has been ranked the 8th best international NGO in the world in the NGO Advisor ranking 2017.[8]
 The organization changed its name to Humanity & Inclusion in January 2018 to better communicate ""the diversity of its activities, which are not confined to supporting people with disabilities.""[1]"
The Idries Shah Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idries_Shah_Foundation	"The Idries Shah Foundation (ISF) is an independent educational and cultural charity,[2] set up by the family[1] of the late thinker, writer, and teacher in the Sufi mystical tradition, Idries Shah, who wrote over three dozen books on topics ranging from psychology and spirituality to travelogues and culture studies.[3][4][5]
 Based in London, England, the charity is primarily for the study, dissemination of knowledge, and promotion of Sufi arts, literature, culture and heritage, with special focus on the published works of Idries Shah.[2][6]
 Printed books, ebooks and audiobooks are being made available by the foundation's publishing arm, ISF Publishing.[7]
 The charity's stated objective is “to promote tolerance and cultural understanding by the dissemination of contemporary Sufi ideas as widely as possible throughout the world.”[8] It aims “to translate the works of Idries Shah into Eastern languages in order to help preserve Sufi ideas and values within the Islamic world, where they originated.”[8]
 Between 2015 and 2020, the foundation's publishing arm, ISF Publishing, plans to republish the complete corpus of Idries Shah in English. This includes print, eBook, and audio editions and, for the first time, American editions as well. The foundation is also working on releasing translations of Shah's publications in Oriental languages (including Arabic, Dari, Pashto, Urdu and Turkish). Translations into other Oriental and European languages are also underfoot. In addition, the foundation is committed to establishing an online archive of Idries Shah's manuscripts and associated material, as well as making Shah's publications available to libraries, schools and universities, in both East and West.[7][8][9][10][11][12]
 The Idries Shah Foundation supersedes the earlier educational charity, The Institute for Cultural Research (ICR),[13] which was originally set up by Idries Shah;[3][14] and ISF Publishing supersedes his[3][4] earlier educational book publishing company, Octagon Press.[15]
 Operating in the United Kingdom and in Afghanistan,[2] The Idries Shah Foundation's registered charity number in England and Wales is 1150876.[2]
 The main goal of the Institute's Children's Books for Afghanistan Project is to provide free illustrated editions of stories by Idries Shah in full colour to children in Afghanistan. Funds raised from the sale of the limited edition titles will be directed towards this project. Using the model that was established by the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge's American charity, Hoopoe Books, the Institute is developing this series of its own children's books, and has received funding to produce them.[16]
 Anyone is permitted to be a Friend of The Idries Shah Foundation, and can do so by registering with an email address on the foundation's web site. Friends of ISF receive monthly and quarterly newsletters of the foundation's progress and activities.
 Each year, Friends of ISF are invited to meet up at a special evening event, usually held in the autumn at the Institute of Ecotechnics' October Gallery, Bloomsbury in London.[17]
 The Idries Shah Foundation was registered as a British charity on 18 February 2013. The founding trustees were Clare Maxwell-Hudson, Gillian Whitworth and Dr. Riad Kocache. (Clare Maxwell-Hudson and Gillian Whitworth had been involved in ICR).[1][18][19][20] While involved in ISF, Idries Shah's three children – Saira Shah, Safia Shah and Tahir Shah – are not trustees. As owners of Shah's copyrights there would be a possible conflict of interest.
 2014 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Idries Shah's first book on Sufism, The Sufis, which award-winning author Doris Lessing, writing in The Washington Post, describes as “a seminal book of the century, even a watershed.”[21] New paperback and ebook editions of the work were published that year by the newly formed ISF Publishing, in association with The Idries Shah Foundation, to coincide with that event.[9][22][23]
 Part of a wider initiative, The Idries Shah Foundation had begun to make available new paperback, ebook and audiobook editions of Shah's 35 or so main titles in English, along with translations into other Western and Eastern languages.[8][9][10][12] In addition, as Idries Shah's books are re-published, they are being made available to read online – via the foundation's web site and also Google Books – free of charge.[11]
 In 2014, The Idries Shah Foundation in partnership with Books With Wings also freely distributed 32,000 books by Idries Shah, together with related Eastern classics, to schools, universities and public libraries in Afghanistan.[24]
 In an article on the Al Jazeera web site in 2014, to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the first publication of The Sufis, John Bell and John Zada write about the wave of intolerant militance and extremism in the East and in Africa and about the destruction of many cultural resources such as libraries and UNESCO World Heritage shrines and mosques in places like Timbuktu.[22]
 Explaining the historical, rich and diverse background of the tolerant Sufi tradition, the authors suggest that the material in Shah's newly republished book The Sufis provides a useful and most-timely counterpoint and antidote to such extremism in the East; to consumerism in the West; and to intolerance, dogmatism and closed thinking, which they and Shah see as material, mental and emotional “prisons”.[22]
 In a related article in The Guardian, author Jason Webster is also of the opinion that the Sufi Way, as it is known, is a natural antidote to fanaticism.[23]
 Webster states that classical Islamic Sufis include (amongst many others) the poet and Persian polymath Omar Khayyám, the Andalusian polymath Avërroes, the Persian poet and hagiographer Fariduddin Attar, and the Persian poet and theologian Jalāl ad-Dīn Rumi.[23]  The writer also notes that when The Sufis first appeared, The Washington Post declared the book “a seminal book of the century”, and that the work attracted writers such as Doris Lessing, J. D. Salinger and Geoffrey Grigson. The poet Ted Hughes also described it as “astonishing” and wrote that “The Sufis must be the biggest society of sensible men on Earth.” According to the reviewer, others in the West drawn to or influenced by Sufism include St Francis of Assisi, the novelist, poet and playwright Miguel de Cervantes, the poet and diplomat Sir Richard Burton, the leading British politician Winston Churchill, and the diplomat and economist Dag Hammarskjöld.[23]
 Stressing the importance of the Foundation's undertaking, Webster writes that “Half a century on, the foundation’s mission to promote Shah’s ideas in the Middle East fits with the ancient Sufi concern of passing knowledge between different cultures, particularly at times of greatest need. To a certain degree, the classics – what Shah drew on to bring Sufism to the west – are being overlooked by younger generations.”[23]
 In another related article on the Asian Affairs journal weblog, author Robert Twigger writes of it being fifty years since the original publication of The Sufis. He notes that the introduction by popular poet, novelist, critic and classicist, Robert Graves helped get the book noticed, and Shah had the support of American psychologist Robert Ornstein and award-winning author Doris Lessing. More recently, historian William Dalrymple has also expressed his debt to Shah's works, as has The Guardian columnist and author Oliver Burkeman.[9]
 Twigger writes that though Shah died in 1996, The Idries Shah Foundation carries the work on. He is of the opinion that “ironically, the original material Shah brought from the Oriental world has been persecuted to extinction in many regions of the East,” and adds that “the shock troops of ISIS will one day depart and folk will need re-introducing to their cultural inheritance.”[9]

IHH (Turkish NGO)	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHH_(Turkish_NGO)	"IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation[2] (Turkish: İHH İnsani Yardım Vakfı; full Turkish name: İnsan Hak ve Hürriyetleri ve İnsani Yardım Vakfı,[3] in English: The Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief) or İHH is a conservative Turkish NGO, whose members are predominantly Turkish Muslims, active in more than 100 countries.[4]
 Established in 1992 and officially registered in Istanbul in 1995, İHH provides humanitarian relief in areas of war, earthquake, hunger, and conflict.[5] The İHH holds Special Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council since 2004[6][7] Current president of the İHH is Fehmi Bülent Yıldırım.
 The İHH was owner and operator of three flotilla ships involved in the convoy intended to breach the blockade of Gaza in 2010. These ships included the MV Mavi Marmara, a passenger vessel that served as the flagship of the convoy.[8][9] As Israeli naval forces boarded the ship in order to prevent breach of the blockade, passengers attacked the boarding forces with clubs, knives and allegedly firearms. Nine passengers aboard the Mavi Marmara, many of them members of the İHH,[10] were killed[11][12][13][14]
 The Istanbul-based Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (İHH) is an Islamic charity group that was formed to provide aid to Bosnian Muslims in the mid-1990s. It has been involved in aid missions in Pakistan, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Indonesia, Iraq, Palestine, Sudan, Somalia, Ghana, Mongolia, China, Brazil, Argentina and other places.[15]
 The organization is active in Turkey, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, South America, Central Asia, South Asia, and the Caucasus.[16]  İHH has held Special Consultative status as an NGO (non-governmental organization) in the United Nations Economic and Social Council since 2004.[6][7] İHH is the organizer of Africa Cataract Project which aims to fight against blindness in Africa.
 The IHH aims to reach every region hit by wars, disasters, poverty and human rights abuses, and believes that civilian
initiatives play a complementary role beside intervention by states and international organizations in resolving humanitarian problems. It is also their goal to deliver humanitarian aid to all people and take necessary steps to prevent any violations against their basic rights and liberties.[17]
 These goals are achieved through the delivering of foodstuffs, clothes and tents to crisis regions hit by wars, conflicts, and natural disaster to meet urgent needs of victims.  The foundation further provides health services in drought and aridity-stricken regions where poverty and deprivation have become chronic, and carries out long-term projects that aim at enabling local peoples stand on their own feet.[17]  For those wanting to work with the organization, some emphasized activities include take active part in their activities, making donations or fund-raising, organizing seminars, and distributing posters.[18]
 Trustees of the organization include:[19]
 The Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief belongs to a number or organizations, including the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in the special consultative status, the Organization of Islamic Conference's (OIC) Humanitarian Forum, the Council of International Organizations for Relief in Iraq, the Union of Non-governmental Organizations of the Islamic World (UNIW), and the Turkish Foundation for Volunteer Organizations (TGTV). The group
has also received the following recognitions:
 The İHH provides social aid, Muslim cultural aid, educational aid, sanitary aid, emergency aid programs in 120 countries.[22] It provides health care and water wells in Africa and runs the Africa Cataract Project, begun in 2007, in ten African countries. İHH has made it possible for thousands of people who are suffering from cataracts but who do not have the economic means to be treated to see again. İHH built 1174 water wells in Africa.[23]
İHH sent two cargo planes to Haiti with 33 tons of humanitarian aid supplies after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[16]
 In December 2007, Today's Zaman wrote that ""various civil society organizations such as Kimse Yok Mu? (Is Anybody There?), Deniz Feneri (Lighthouse), the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (İHH) and Can Suyu assisted thousands of charitable donors in reaching out to poverty-stricken residents of the Kurdish-dominated eastern and southeastern regions of Turkey.""[24]
 World Bulletin wrote in August 2009 that hundreds of water wells were dug and fountains were built in an aid effort under the leadership of Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (İHH) across African countries.[25] Several Turkish nongovernmental organizations, such as Kimse Yok Mu? (Is anybody there?), the Humanitarian Aid Foundation (İHH) and Deniz Feneri (lighthouse), also provided aid to storm survivors in Bangladesh.[26]
 İHH previously sent packages containing flour, legumes, oil and sugar to 350 families residing in Zewaya Dugda, one of the poorest regions in the Ethiopia.
The UN announced that around 6 million children in Ethiopia faced risk of acute under-nutrition and urged countries to send aid.[27]
 After the earthquake in Indonesia, Doctors Worldwide and The Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (IHH) sent volunteers and aid to Indonesia.[28]
İHH opened mosques, dug waterwells, distributed Qur'ans, organized iftars, aiding orphans and refugees in Darfur.[29]
 In Gaza, the İHH is renovating the port, funding a Turkish-Palestinian school and plans to build a hospital and apartments for Gazans made homeless during the Gaza War.[30]
 IHH has been involved with the United Nations in a number of ways. For example, the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief attended the 44th Session of the Commission for Social Development and contributed to the panel discussion for the eradication of poverty. The group has attended other meetings, including:[17]
 Refugees (UNHCR)
 The project aims at performing 100.000 free cataract surgery operations in ten African countries: Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Chad, Niger, Togo, Benin, Gana, Mali, and Burkina Faso. Volunteer Turkish surgeons and nurses take part in the project and travel to African countries for surgery. One of the objectives of the program is to offer free eye care for needy people. The Turkish International Cooperation and Development Agency and Turkey's and Sudan's Ministries of Health are supporting the project. All surgeries are broadcast live on the project website and the IHH website.[31][32]
 In 2011, IHH worked with Turkish aid groups like Kimse Yok Mu, the Turkish Red Crescent (Kızılay) and Doctors Worldwide in Somalia. IHH aid reached a total of 376,777 people. Relief efforts, totaling TL 2,420,612 (c US$ 400,00) included food and medicine distributions, digging 70 water wells, health screenings, fitr (alms) donations and iftars (fast-breaking meals). With regards to its work in Somalia, one worker said that ""the İHH already has been working in Somalia for the last 15 years in the fields of education and social and medical care. As for the food crisis, the activities will continue for at least another three years because the drought has spread and it sounds like it's not over. But as for other fields, the İHH is there and the activities will continue."" He continued that ""in order to help families of orphans to make a living and stand on their own two feet, we gave the families of 40 orphans sewing machines and cows, while we gave another 20 families sesame and flour milling machines. In addition, the İHH offered medical examinations to 400 orphans and treated 137 children with various diseases.""[33]
 In 2010, the ship Gazze set sail for Pakistan to deliver humanitarian aid to the people affected by floods in the country. The ship carried 3,000 tons of humanitarian supplies including, medicine, food, generators, clothes and tents.[34]
 In 2011, IHH worked with the Khubaib Foundation to distribute relief goods amongst 500 flood stricken families in Lakki Marwat, a southern district of Pakistan. Some of the items included 270 containers which contained both food and non-food items. This was among clothes, shawls, footwear, and food items including rice, beans, canned food, power milk and children's cereal that were also distributed.[35]
 In response to the humanitarian situation during 2011 Libyan civil war, IHH sent a cargo ship carrying nine containers, 141 tons of humanitarian aid including medication, food packages, infant formula, milk powder, hygiene kits and clothing.[36][37] The ship set sail from Turkey and dropped anchor in Malta.
 The IHH worked with the Istanbul Peace Platform to host a conference focused on China's traditionally Turkic Muslim region of Xinjiang and which aimed to highlight the remote region's problems in the wake of July 2009 communal clashes. Official government sources said nearly 200 people were killed and 1,600 wounded in July 2009 riots in Xinjiang's capital, Ürümqi, in the worst ethnic unrest in China in decades. Beijing claimed the riots were orchestrated by overseas activists for the rights of Uighurs, historically Xinjiang's largest ethnic group. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has called the violence in Xinjiang ""a kind of genocide.""[38]
 The IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation sent a rescue team of 5 to the Japan. IHH deputy chairman Yaşar Kutluay said ""we sent our team to Japan which also went to Haiti due to the earthquake and to Pakistan due to the floods and lastly went to Tunisia and Libya due to the recent developments. Our team will contact with Japanese authorities to organize relief works. Our team will bring sonar system and search and rescue equipments.""[39]
 The IHH aid team conducted relief efforts in Sendai which was most heavily devastated by the earthquake and took relief to around 5.000 people. Güzel said Sendai has turned into a ghost city in the aftermath of the quake disaster and ensuing tsunami and it may take long years for Japan to recover from the aftereffects of the disaster. Güzel noted that the humanitarian crisis in Japan may deteriorate if international aid is not provided to the country.[40]
 As reported on 28 March 2015, the IHH secured the release of two Czech tourists, Antonie Chrástecká and Hana Humpálová, following two months of intense negotiations. They were kidnapped near Taftan, Pakistan, by an al Qaeda-linked armed group on 13 March 2013, while travelling overland from Europe to India.[41]
 In January 2010, the Free Gaza Movement and İHH announced a joint venture to send ten vessels to the Gaza strip in the spring of 2010, a flotilla to be further joined by organizations from Greece, Ireland and Sweden.[42]
 On 30 May 2010, a flotilla of six ships carrying 663 activists from 37 nations rendezvoused near Cyprus and set sail for Gaza.[43][44] The stated intention of the Gaza flotilla, like for earlier flotillas organized by the Free Gaza Movement, was to break through Israel's blockade of the Gaza strip and to deliver humanitarian supplies.[45][46] The İHH spent more than $2 million on the ships.[47] İHH activists were set apart from other activists involved in the mission by a willingness to resist Israeli forces.[10]
 On 31 May 2010, after the IHH refused that the Israel Defense Forces will check the ship's cargo in Ashdod port, Israeli forces intercepted the fleet in the international waters. On the MV Mavi Marmara, one of the ships owned and operated by the İHH, boarding Israeli forces came under coordinated armed attack. In the clashes, nine activists were killed (Eight Turkish nationals and a Turkish-American), and dozens of activists and seven Israeli commandos were wounded. On three other ships, activists showed passive resistance, which was suppressed by Israeli forces without deaths or injuries, and two others were taken without incident. The activists were subsequently arrested and detained in Israel before being deported. Widespread international condemnation of the raid followed, Israel-Turkey relations were strained, Israel subsequently eased its blockade of the Gaza strip, and Egypt lifted its blockade, opening its Rafah Border Crossing with the Gaza Strip.[48]
 On 18 June 2010, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs released video footage of a rally on board the Mavi Marmara the day before the raid in which the İHH President Fehmi Bülent Yıldırım declared to dozens of activists: ""And we say: 'If you [Israel] send the commandos, we will throw you down from here to the sea and you will be humiliated in front of the whole world'"", as participating passengers chant ""millions of martyrs marching to Gaza!""[49]
 In September 2011, a United Nations report, after analysis of both Turkey and Israeli national investigations, concluded that the Israeli blockade was legal, but that Israel army used excessive force in this incident. The report also mentioned ""serious questions about the conduct, true nature and objectives of the flotilla organizers, particularly IHH.""[UN Palmer Report 2011, p. 4.]
 İHH abstained from the 2011 flotilla, citing outstanding damage to the Mavi Marmara.
 In September 2011, Istanbul Deputy Public Prosecutor Ates Shasan Sozen told the Turkish daily Today's Zaman that the IHH identified and submitted a list of 174 IDF soldiers to the Prosecutor's Office.[50][51]
 The flotilla event generated mixed perceptions of IHH. The group was described as a humanitarian[52][53][54] group and as a charity following the flotilla event;[55][56] however, the group was also challenged for alleged affiliations with organizations such as Hamas.[57] Critics charged the allegations arose after the raid simply because of the scale of the political fallout from the raid.[58] IHH maintained that the best way to judge it was its behavior and responded that ""we collected US$1 million (Dh3.7m) for victims of the Haiti earthquake, and we delivered our aid in a church there."" Other IHH officials said the organisation is opposed to violence and relies on donations from the Turkish public, up to 80 per cent of which come from poor families.[58]
 Some of the allegations included that IHH has been banned in Germany, that IHH has raised funds for jihadi fighters in Bosnia, Chechnya, and Afghanistan, that French intelligence has documented calls between the group and an Al Qaeda boarding house in Milan, Italy, as well as Algerian militants in Europe, and that IHH reportedly played an ""important role"" in the Millennium bomb plot against LAX airport, Los Angeles.[59]
 That IHH was banned in Germany later turned out to be a mixup between the Turkish İnsan Hak ve Hürriyetleri and the banned German Internationale Humanitäre Hilfsorganisation e.V.. The U.S. government said it ""cannot validate"" any relationship or connection between İHH and al-Qaida.[60] Turkish authorities made no further efforts after the raid regarding support for Bosnian, Chechen and Afghan fighters[58] and IHH replied that there was an acquittal in the court case and nothing ever came of the charges.[61] Testimony regarding IHH and the Millennium bomb plot was thrown out in court by a judge because it would ""necessarily be based upon hearsay"".[62]
 An IHH board member responded in the Los Angeles Times that IHH provides charity in more than 100 countries. He stated there was no proof that IHH has any connections to Al Qaeda or its affiliates, and also said that its involvement with Bosnia and Chechnya amounted to food, clothes and medicine. Those who ""accuse us of terrorism are the very people who kill innocent victims,"" said Ali Cihangir, an IHH board member, referring to the Israeli raid on the Mavi Marmara that left nine Turkish activists dead. ""There are political reasons countries are saying this about us.""[71]
 According to The Times, a Free Syrian Army commander said that a boat carrying weapons docked in Syria in September 2012 and ""was registered to members of the IHH, which has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood"". Samar Srewel, an FSA activist who had helped to organize the consignment, told The Times: ""It was clear from that second what was happening. The Muslim Brotherhood, through its ties in Turkey, was seizing control of this ship and the cargo. This is what they do. They buy influence with their money and guns.""[72][73]
 On 18 March 2016, Russia's UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin sent a letter to the UN Security Council saying that three Turkish humanitarian organizations (NGOs) sent weapons and supplies to extremists in Syria on behalf of Turkey's MIT intelligence agency during the Syrian Civil War. The three NGOs were the Besar Foundation, the Iyilikder Foundation and the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms (IHH).[74]
 At an interview with the Investigative Project on Terrorism in 2018, former Turkish National Police official Ahmet Yayla said the National Intelligence Organization has used Turkey's IHH as an intermediary to provide al-Qaeda with weapons.[75]
 Anadolu Agency reported that two employees of IHH, were detained for alleged links to al-Qaida, in a Turkish anti-terrorism police raids on 13 January 2014. IHH spokesman said that police searched its office in Kilis, near the border with Syria, and detained one of its employees. Another IHH employee was detained in Kayseri after a police raid at his home.[76]
 The IHH has repeatedly supported the (re-)conversion of the Hagia Sophia, a former Christian Cathedral which was converted into a Mosque after the Ottoman conquest of Istanbul and is now a Museum and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, into a Mosque, and in 2015 IHH organised and led political rallies in Istanbul, in an effort to support its cause.[77][78][79]
  In 2008, Israel became the only country to ban the organization, doing so out of concern about its alleged sympathies with Hamas."

 In 1996, Carol Reitan, Alan Sender and Drake Zimmerman began building their dream of a community foundation for McLean County.[29] Considerable research on existing community foundations, talks with many community leaders, and persistence in working through all of the legal requirements to establish a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization came to fruition two years later. Mayors Judy Markowitz of Bloomington and Kent Karraker of Normal, and McLean County Board Chairperson Gary Riss agreed to serve as the first incorporating board. The Community Foundation of McLean County was officially established on November 6, 1998. Gifts of $296,900 were placed in the Peoria Area Community Foundation of Central Illinois before the end of 1998 in an account held on behalf of CFMC. These were Donor Advised Funds, established and donated before CFMC was in a position to receive gifts.
 By June, 2003, the Community Foundation of McLean County was serving donors and making grants in Livingston and DeWitt Counties and surrounding areas. Permanent 501(c)(3) status had been achieved. Assets had grown to almost $600,000. The Board of Directors decided a name change was in order. Before action could be taken, Logan County was added to the list of locations being served and assets had grown to $800,000. In April, 2004, we officially became Illinois Prairie Community Foundation, Inc. Since 2004, the IPCF has grown dramatically. In fiscal 2007 (July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007) the Foundation and its donors distributed $484,841 in grants. Total assets as of December 31, 2007 were $5,981,822.[30]"

International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Societies	"The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is a worldwide humanitarian aid organization that reaches 160 million people each year through its 190-member National Societies.[4] It acts before, during and after disasters and health emergencies to meet the needs and improve the lives of vulnerable people. It does so with impartiality as to nationality, race, gender, religious beliefs, class and political opinions.
 Guided by Strategy 2020[5] – the IFRC's collective plan of action to tackle the major humanitarian and development challenges of this decade – the IFRC is committed to saving lives and changing minds.
 The IFRC is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement along with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and 190 National Societies.[6] The IFRC's strength lies in its volunteer network, community-based expertise and independence and neutrality. It works to improve humanitarian standards, as partners in development and in response to disasters. It persuades decision makers to act in the interests of vulnerable people. It works to enable healthy and safe communities, reduce vulnerabilities, strengthen resilience and foster a culture of peace around the world.
 The seven Fundamental Principles that guide the work of the IFRC and its members are: humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality.
 On 5 May 1919, following the First World War, representatives from the National Red Cross Societies of the Allied Powers (Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the US) came together in Paris to establish the League of Red Cross Societies (LORCS) whose stated goal was ""to strengthen and unite, for health activities, already-existing Red Cross Societies and to promote the creation of new Societies"".[7] The initiative was taken by Henry P. Davison, then chairman of the American Red Cross' “War Committee”,[8] with the support of Woodrow Wilson, the President of the United States of America. Davison was assisted by the British general Sir David Henderson who became the first Director-General. This  newly created federation of National Societies expanded the international mandate of the Red Cross Movement beyond the strict mission of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to include relief assistance in response to emergencies which were not caused by armed conflict. In addition to the coordination of relief operations caused by natural disasters and health emergencies, the league's mission was to assist National Societies in their founding and development, especially in peacetime.
 In addition to providing assistance to victims of epidemics, natural disasters (earthquakes, floods and hurricanes) and famines, two other activities were developed during the first years of the league. One main activity was to promote health by preventing illnesses and developing the training of nurses and volunteers. The other activity was to create the Junior Red Cross within the National Societies, which introduced children and students to the Red Cross with various educational courses and involved them in practical relief activities.
 The formation of the league, as an additional international Red Cross organization alongside the ICRC, was not without controversy. The ICRC had, to some extent, valid concerns about a possible rivalry between the two organizations. The foundation of the league was seen as an attempt to undermine the leadership position of the ICRC within the Movement and to gradually transfer tasks and competencies to a multilateral institution. As well, Davison did not want to include National Societies of the defeated powers, namely Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, which was contrary to the ICRC's principle of universality. Moreover, the league's beginnings were expeditious as it took 154 days between the approval of President Wilson and its incorporation. This hasty formation forced Davison to cut corners and leave unresolved issues such as a clear framework of the league's mandate, duties and funding.
 The coexistence concerns between the league and the ICRC were discussed during three consecutive International Conferences of the Red Cross (1921, 1923, 1926). The statutes adopted in 1928 at the XIIIth International Conference of the Red Cross in The Hague clarified and confirmed the roles of each entity.[9] In that same year, the ""International Council"" was founded to coordinate cooperation between the ICRC and the league, a task which was later taken over by the Standing Commission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.
 In 1920, the league's “General Council, originally composed of representatives of the victorious Allies”,[10] welcomed additional National Societies; 27 out of the 31 member societies were represented in 1920. In the following decade, the league admitted over 25 National Societies, including the Egyptian Red Crescent and the Red Lion and Sun of Iran.[11] Following the adoption of the Statutes of the International Red Cross in 1928 (revised in 1952 and 1986, amended in 1995 and 2006), the National Societies of the Nordic Red Cross (Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway) returned to the league after resigning three years earlier because of the discords within the Red Cross movement.[12] The Alliance of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union joined the league during the XVth International Conference in 1934. By the mid-1930s, the league became truly universal, with 58 registered National Societies.[13]
 The league's headquarters, named the secretariat, was originally based in Geneva. The league moved its secretariat from Geneva to Paris in 1922 with a restrained budget and reduced staff. The need to move away from the ICRC to further develop the league's own identity was part of the decision-making. On September 5, 1939, days following the German troops invasion of Poland, the league personnel in Paris were moved to Geneva. The league believed it could ensure the continuity of its work from a neutral country such as Switzerland. To this day, the secretariat's offices have remained in Geneva, but it was only in 1959 that the secretariat moved into its current headquarters in Petit-Saconnex.[14]
 During the first years of the league, the work was essentially reactive and consisted mostly of recording information and statistics to be shared with the National Societies.[15] The league's first operational mission was to perform onsite observations of the conditions of the victims of a typhus epidemic in Poland,[16] and to develop and circulate information material to the surrounding countries to prevent the spread of similar epidemics diseases. The first large-scale relief action of the league came after the 1923 earthquake in Japan which killed about 200,000 people and left countless more injured and without shelter. For the first time, 35 National Red Cross Societies participated in a joint action of the ICRC and the league, for which the record sum of 277 million Swiss francs was donated.[17]
 The league began issuing appeals in 1925 but appeals were not consistently issued for all disasters. During the 1920s and 1930s disaster relief remained a minor activity, behind public health, nursing and youth activities. The National Societies, with the league's assistance in the 1920s, were better prepared to deal with disaster relief and consequently less in need of external assistance.[18] Additionally, the Great Depression caused economic insecurity worldwide, urging the league to dedicate more coverage to poverty programs.
 The 1930s saw the growing use of the automobile, the development of road infrastructure and consequently the increase of traffic and casualties. The league became a leader in first aid prevention for road accidents, by establishing in 1932 a Permanent Committee on First Aid on Roads, with the collaboration of various motoring associations.[19]
 As the world headed closer to another war, the activities of the league reduced considerably. Nonetheless, the collaboration between the league and the ICRC continued to grow. The league provided support to the ICRC in the late 1930s, notably during the Spanish Civil War and the Second Sino-Japanese war, by issuing appeals and establishing distribution points of food and medical supplies for the civilians. The Joint Relief Commission, initiated by the ICRC in 1941, established the mandates of the league and the ICRC, ensuring their continuous support to the National Societies amid the intensifying war. This agreement also increased the National Societies' independence and allowed them to pursue their civilian relief activities without causing friction with the belligerent, occupied and neutral states.
 After a six-year hiatus, the board of governors held its first meeting in October 1945. The post-war period provided a new driving force to the league as it resumed its relations with the National Societies and provided relief to war-affected regions.
 Following disastrous weather conditions that afflicted parts the world between 1951 and 1954,[20] the league's relief activities became more operational and were no longer entirely informational. During those years, the league issued numerous appeals and showed great efficiency in disaster relief operations. In the late 1950s, there was a marked increase in the number of recognized Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies due to decolonisation.[21] By the end of the 1960s, there were more than 100 societies around the world.[22] On December 10, 1963, the league and the ICRC jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize.[23]
 In 1983, the League of Red Cross Societies was renamed to the ""League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies"" to reflect the growing number of National Societies operating under the Red Crescent symbol. Three years later, the seven fundamental principles of the Movement, as adopted at the XXth International Conference of the Red Cross in 1965, were incorporated into the league's statutes. The name of the league was changed again during the General Assembly of 1991 to its current official designation the ""International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies"" (IFRC).  In 1997, the ICRC and the IFRC signed the Seville Agreement which further defined the responsibilities of both organisations within the Movement.[24]
 Until the beginning of the 1990s all disaster relief operations were responded as one Federation in a multilateral form. Donor red cross national societies were used to provide support through the Federation Secretariat, with money and human resources to support the Federation in the response to disasters under the coordination and leadership of the Federation Secretariat. The focus at that time was of one team, with a common mission, common goals in support of a sister red cross or red crescent society affected by a disaster.
 Hurricane Mitch affected few countries in Central America in 1998. The disaster relief efforts could be considered one of the disaster response operations that change the course of multilateralism within the membership of the International Federation. Since then, bilateralism become the new norm, and the reduce number of red cross from wealthy countries responding to disasters and expanding to development work continuously grow during the 2000s, including the growing number of red crescent societies operating internationally.
 In 2004, the IFRC began its largest mission to date after the tsunami disaster in South Asia. More than 40 National Societies worked with more than 22,000 volunteers to bring relief to the countless victims left without food and shelter and endangered by the risk of epidemics.[25]
 The IFRC coordinates between National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies throughout the world. The IFRC along with ICRC supports the foundation of new National Societies in countries where no official society exists. A National Society is admitted as a member to the IFRC only after it is recognized by the ICRC. The IFRC cooperates with the National Societies of the affected countries – called the Host National Society (HNS) – as well as the National Societies of other countries willing to offer assistance – called Partner National Societies (PNS). Among the 190 National Societies admitted to the General Assembly of the IFRC as full members or observers, about 25–30 regularly work as PNS in other countries. The most active are the American Red Cross, the British Red Cross, the German Red Cross, and the Red Cross Societies of Sweden and Norway. Another major mission of the IFRC which has gained attention in recent years is its commitment to work towards a codified, worldwide ban on the use of land mines and to bring medical, psychological, and social support for people injured by land mines.
 The stated tasks of the IFRC can be summarized as follows:
 The Red Cross Red Crescent is the world's largest humanitarian network with:[26]
 The IFRC has its secretariat in Geneva. It also has five regional offices and numerous country and multi-country cluster offices around the world. The secretary general is Elhadj As Sy (Senegal).[27] The IFRC is governed by a governing board consisting of a president, four vice-presidents, the chairman of the finance commission and 20 National Society representatives.[28]  The highest body of the IFRC is the General Assembly which convenes every two years with delegates from all National Societies. Among other tasks, the General Assembly elects the president. The current president of the IFRC is Francesco Rocca, who also fulfills the role of president of the Italian Red Cross.
 As of 2017[update],[29] the president of the IFRC is Francesco Rocca (Italian Red Cross). The vice presidents are Annemarie Huber-Hotz (Swiss Red Cross), Miguel Villarroel (Venezuela Red Cross), Abdoul Azize Diallo (Senegalese Red Cross Society), Kerem Kinik (Turkish Red Crescent), Chen Zhu (Red Cross Society of China).
 Former presidents (until 1977 titled ""Chairman"") have been:
 
 
 The IFRC is funded by statutory contributions from National Societies, the delivery of field services to programme partners, and voluntary contributions from donors such as governments, corporations and individuals. The criteria for the statutory contributions of each National Society are established by the Finance Commission and approved by the General Assembly. Additional funding, especially for unforeseen relief assistance missions, is raised by emergency appeals. From 2005 to 2015, the Chairman of the Finance Commission was Mr. Chrystold Chetty (Seychelles) and the Vice- Chair was Ms Kathryn Forbes (United States). From 2016, the Chairman is Mr. Abdulkader Husrieh. Ms Kathryn Forbes has been nominated the Chairperson of the Audit and Risk Committee whilst Mr. Chrystold Chetty has been elected as a member of the Standing Commission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.
 The emblem of the IFRC is the combination of a red cross and a red crescent on a white background, surrounded by a red rectangular frame without any additional text. The red cross, the original symbol of the Movement, is on the left while the red crescent appears to the right. Per Humanitatem ad Pacem is the primary motto of the IFRC (Article 1 of the Constitution of the Federation). The mission statement of the IFRC, as formulated in its ""Strategy 2010"" document is to improve the lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of humanity. From 1999 to 2004, the common slogan for all activities of the International Movement was The Power of Humanity. In December 2003, the 28th International Conference in Geneva adopted the conference motto Protecting Human Dignity as the new slogan for the entire Movement.
 The official logo for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement published in April 2016 was described as the red cross and red crescent emblems placed together side by side, encircled by the words ""INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT"" in one or other of their official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian or Spanish). It was described as for use when the ICRC, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies operate together for the purposes of a humanitarian emergency, or a theme or campaign of global concern.[30]
 The IFRC has come into conflict with the ICRC at various times, first and foremost when the American Red Cross threatened to supplant the ICRC with its creation of the league as ""a real international Red Cross"" after the First World War.[31] Several agreements about the respective roles of the organizations helped to smooth relations, beginning with the agreement of 1928, the 1997 Seville Agreement and most recently the Supplementary Measures of 2005. The Seville Agreement gives the IFRC the lead in any emergency which does not take place as part of armed conflict (in which case the ICRC takes charge). Organizational discord has now largely subsided.[32]

International Foundation for Electoral Systems	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Foundation_for_Electoral_Systems	"The International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) is an international, non-profit organization founded in 1987.[1] Based in Arlington, VA - this organization helps develop and provides assistance and support for elections in new and emerging democracies. Since 1987, IFES has provided assistance in 145 countries and currently has programs in more than 20 countries throughout Asia-Pacific, Africa, Eurasia, Middle East and North Africa, and  Americas.[1]
 According to IFES. They works to advance good governance and democratic rights by:
 IFES is supervised by a Board of Directors made up of  Democrats, and Republicans politician and members of the international community. The current president of IFES is Anthony Banbury. He replaced Bill Sweeney[2] in 2018. 
 IFES is a non-governmental organization; registered as a 501(c)(3) in the United States.
 IFES founded by F. Clifton White on September 19, 1987 as a response to Ronald Reagan's 1982 Westminster speech in which he stressed the importance of promoting democracy. IFES was established along with other organizations focusing on democracy promotion, including the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI), and the International Republican Institute (IRI), all established in 1983.
 In 1989, IFES began its first project, which focused on the Paraguayan general elections[3] of that year.
 By 1990, IFES had established its first field office in Haiti.[3]
 In 1991, IFES convened a conference which established the Association of Central and Eastern European Election Officials (ACEEEO), its first cooperative agreement with USAID, and opened a new Resource Center.[3]
 In 1995, IFES embarked on a joint venture with International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs to create the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (CEPPS).[3] This is a cooperative agreement supervised by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Office of Democracy and Governance which is the principal contractor for the Office of Democracy and Government's elections and political processes program which provides technical assistance and support to USAID missions worldwide.[4]
 In 1995, IFES also accomplished its first surveys in Russia and Ukraine. The first IFES-created non-government organization, CENTRAS, also became private at this time as a continuation of the IFES's ""Civic Voice"" project in Romania.[5]
 In 1996, IFES received its first international appointment from Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE: Bosnia and Herzegovina) and, in 1997, worked with the Association of Caribbean Electoral Organizations (ACEO) to adopt the San Juan Declaration which is IFES' first disability effort.
 In 1998, IFES partnered up with International IDEA and UNDESA, with funding from USAID, to release the Administration and Cost of Elections project. ACE became one of the most valued and best-known international depositories of knowledge on managing elections, focused on the administrative and cost implications of the choices available.[6] In 2006 the name was changed to the ACE Electoral Knowledge Network (with the letters ACE no longer standing for Administration and Cost of Elections) and launched a new dynamic online knowledge repository that provides information and advice on improving elections and the elections process.[7]
 In 1998, IFES also opened its first field office in Asia located in the Philippines.
 In 1999, as part of its youth and elections programs, IFES introduces a 10-day Summer Democracy Camp for middle and high school students. The Democracy Camps teach youngsters about democracy and how to participate in the political process. The first Democracy Camp program was in Uzbekistan during the summer of 1999.[8]
 In 2002, IFES worked on its first ever domestic projects which focused on the 2002 Florida Elections.
 In 2002, voters with disabilities were able to use IFES' Tactile Ballot Guide in Sierra Leone's May 2002 presidential and parliamentary elections.[9] This was the first time in Africa that the visually impaired were able to cast their ballots unassisted and in secret.
 In 2003, IFES acquired The Center for Democracy, an organization founded in 1985 by Allen Weinstein.
 In 2005, IFES established the Charles T. Manatt Democracy Awards to pay tribute to outstanding men and women who are committed to freedom and democracy, just like Ambassador Manatt. IFES awards three individuals each year: one Democrat, one Republican, and a member of the international community to highlight the fact that democracy work transcends political barriers and national borders.
 As part of IFES' 20th anniversary, in 2007, it hosted the fourth Global Electoral Organization Conference (GEO Conference) in Washington. This conference brought together 200 election officials and democracy advocates from 67 countries to discuss the most pressing issues in the field of election administration.[10]
 With global attention on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, IFES gathered 550 participants from 90 countries for the 2016 U.S. Election Program[11] and Seventh Global Elections Organization Conference (GEO-7) from November 6–10. The 2016 USEP and GEO-7 was the largest international gathering of election professionals of the year and the 13th hosted by IFES since 1992. This flagship event brings together election officials, parliamentarians and diplomats from around the world to observe and learn about the U.S. electoral system as well as discuss elections and voting from comparative international perspectives.
 IFES gives two annual awards: the Joe C. Baxter Award and the Charles T. Manatt Democracy Award.[12][13]
 
 IFES receives funding from the following donors (among others) as listed on its website:[16]
 
 
 IFES is also proud of partner with international and domestic organizations around the world to advance good governance and democratic rights.
 IFES has worked in over 20 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa over the past three decades.
 Currently, IFES has programs in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe.
 IFES lent significant support to the development of the Association of African Election Authorities.
 IFES has been developing and implementing programs in the Americas region since its foundation, in 1987.
 Currently, IFES has programs in the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Haiti.
 Over the last three decades, IFES has engaged in programming and research across Asia-Pacific, partnering global expertise with local solutions through combining efforts with a variety of partner organizations. 
 Currently, IFES has programs in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste.
 Across Europe and Eurasia, IFES applies its technical expertise in an effort to advance good governance and democratic rights. IFES has had a long-term presence in many countries in Europe, such as Ukraine – where IFES has regularly conducted public opinion surveys since 1994 – and continues to conduct programming in diverse environments in countries such as Georgia and Kyrgyzstan.
 Currently, IFES has programs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia and Ukraine as well as a regional program across Europe.
 Over the last three decades, IFES has worked in over a dozen countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa.
 Currently, IFES has programs in Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Tunisia."
International Fund for Animal Welfare	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fund_for_Animal_Welfare	"The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) is one of the largest animal welfare and conservation charities in the world.
 The organization works to rescue individual animals, safeguard populations, preserve habitat, and advocate for greater protections.[1]
 The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) was founded in 1969, in initial efforts to stop the commercial hunt for seal pups on the east coast of Canada.
 With offices in 15 countries, and projects in more than 40,[2] IFAW is one of the largest animal welfare organisations in the world.
 The fund is supported by individual and major corporate donors, the latter including the Disneynature and the Disney Conservation Fund, the Petfinder Foundation and Arctic Fox, among others.[3][4][5]
 IFAW is best known for its leading role in the campaigns to end the commercial seal hunt in Canada[8] and end commercial whaling,[9] as well as its work to help dogs and cats in impoverished communities,[10] protect elephants,[11] end illegal ivory trade,[12] rescue and release of wild animals such orphan rhinos[13] and rescue of animals in the wake of disasters such as hurricane Katrina in the US.[14]
 A financial manager of the Brian Davies Foundation, IFAW invested IFAW's money in organizations that carried out animal experiments, such as Bausch & Lomb, US Surgicals, Glaxo, Merck, Abbot, Upjohn, Philip Morris and McDonald's. When the investment was drawn to the attention of IFAW's trustees, the shares were sold immediately and the financial manager dismissed.[15]
 When Davies retired from IFAW in 1997 to start Network For Animals, IFAW established a payment schedule to use his name and image for fundraising and campaigns. The contract was important for the continued level of success that IFAW achieved with Davies' leadership, according to research on successful animal welfare organizations"".[16]  Davies had the following to say about it: ""I signed an agreement with IFAW which was conceived by the trustees. I was opposed to the idea of receiving remuneration from two animal welfare organisations; this solution allowed me to run Network For Animals without pay for seven years.""[15]"
International Literacy Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Literacy_Foundation	"The International Literacy Foundation (ILF) is an independent, international nonprofit organisation, founded in 2010 with the aim of tackling illiteracy globally and therefore improving living standards around the world.
 The organisation has a mandate of alleviating illiteracy throughout the world.[1] The core belief of the organisation and its affiliates is that literacy is the 'quintessential cornerstone of education', key to reducing poverty and therefore raising living standards around the world. It maintains a dedicated focus on individual causes, with the potential to make a positive impact on underprivileged groups and their quality of life.
 The ILF seeks to meet these objectives through the administration of literacy-based projects, which is achieved through several methods:
 The mission of the ILF is based on its commitment to invest in initiatives encouraging and supporting literacy and education, with a primary focus on literacy, as well as making grants to other organisations supporting similar educational causes, including those in which members and volunteers are engaged.
 As the organisation has its roots in education, however, it has a firm belief in the power of volunteers to collaborate, creating human opportunity and exerting a positive impact on the quality of life of those who are less fortunate.
 Funding provided will therefore target selected initiatives and activities that promote education through literacy.
 A Global Literacy Primer can also be found on the website, highlighting additional information[2]
 Further information can be found on the website.[1]
 Below are a list of countries in which volunteers for the ILF are working:[1]
 
 On the map above, completed projects are shaded in black while pipeline projects are shaded in green
 As well as the two projects already completed thus far (as of March 27, 2011), the organisation has already highlighted several new locations in its tireless efforts to tackle the serious problem of illiteracy; these include:
 The ILF has collaborated with corporate sponsors, who help facilitate its international literacy projects. These organisations include the following, among others:[1]"
International Medical Corps	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Medical_Corps	"International Medical Corps is a global humanitarian nonprofit organization established by volunteer doctors and nurses. The organization is a global first responder during disasters and humanitarian crises, providing emergency medical relief, delivering healthcare to affected regions and training local healthcare workers with the goal of creating self-reliant, self-sustaining medical services and infrastructure in places where these had previously been lacking.
 International Medical Corps focuses on health services support, including primary and secondary healthcare, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, supplemental food for malnourished children, clean water and hygiene education, mental health and psychosocial care, women's and children's health (including gender-based violence), and emergency response and preparedness.
 International Medical Corps is a founding member of the ONE Campaign and a member of the Clinton Global Initiative.
 The organization was founded in 1984 by Dr. Robert Simon, together with a group of American physicians and nurses. Simon is a professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Rush University, John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County in Chicago. He is the former Bureau Chief of the Cook County Bureau of Health Services.
 International Medical Corps works in some 30 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, providing relief to populations facing war, conflict, natural disaster, famine and poverty, while also laying the foundation for sustainable development. Its programs are funded from both public and private sources, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO), the United Nations, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and AmeriCares.
 International Medical Corps is based in Los Angeles, with other offices in Washington, D.C.; London, England; and Split, Croatia. It currently employs some 7,000 staff in 30 countries.
 International Medical Corps has provided disaster relief for people impacted by the 2010 Haiti earthquake,[1] the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami,[2] the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, and the April 2015 Nepal earthquake."
International Planned Parenthood Federation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Planned_Parenthood_Federation	"The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) is a global non-governmental organisation with the broad aims of promoting sexual and reproductive health, and advocating the right of individuals to make their own choices in family planning. It was first formed in 1952 in Bombay (present-day Mumbai), India by Margaret Sanger and Lady Rama Rau at the Third International Conference on Planned Parenthood with support of an expanding population with limited resources.[1] Presently, it consists of more than 149 Member Associations working in more than 189 countries. The IPPF is highly developed and organised into six regions. The organisation is based in London, England.
 Member Associations provide non-profit family planning services, sexual health and abuse prevention training and education. Their goals include giving clients the information necessary to make informed sexual health decisions, promoting continuing sexual health, making available high quality sexual health services, improving the overall health of low income individuals, and using democratic organisation and the leadership of volunteers to promote these goals. Over 40% of the organisation's resources are aimed at serving the needs of young people; as the IPPF explains, individuals under 25 (and especially females) are at a much higher risk of getting infected with HIV.[2]
 The IPPF is financially supported by governments, trusts, and foundations including the European Commission and the United Nations Population Fund for special projects. Half of the balance of their funding comes from government official development assistance programmes. To achieve their goals as an organisation, the IPPF often collaborates with the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[citation needed]
 The IPPF is a prominent lobbyist in the European Union: specifically, for the European Council and the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). It is the only non-governmental organisation (NGO) that focuses on sexual health and reproductive rights to qualify for Consultative Status with the Council of Europe. This allows the IPPF to sit in on the Parliamentary Assembly.[citation needed]
 In April 2011, it was revealed that IPPF, which had applied for an $18 million grant more than a year previously, had been denied funding by a Conservative Party government due to lobbying efforts by ""pro-life"" groups.[3]
 On 22 September 2011, the Canadian International Development Agency granted IPPF $6 million over three years. The money is for services yet to be rendered in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Mali, Sudan, and Tanzania.[4] Many anti-abortion activists have been critical of the spending including conservative MP Brad Trost who criticised his own party for supporting the ""pro-choice"" group.[5]
 IPPF advocates for access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services including contraception and safe abortion services. On his first day in office, U.S. President George W. Bush, reinstated the Mexico City Policy. This policy required non-governmental organisations in receipt of U.S. funds to refrain from providing or advocating for safe abortion services. IPPF opted not to sign the Global Gag Rule and lost 20% of its funding during the time the Mexico City Policy was in effect. The policy was rescinded by President Barack Obama in January 2009,[6] but was reinstated by President Donald Trump in January 2017.
 The International Planned Parenthood Federation was established after earlier efforts to organise the post-World War II family planning and population control movements. The first conference was organised by the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education in Stockholm,  in August 1946.[9] Two years later another meeting was held, the International Congress on Population and World Resources in Relation to the Family, in Cheltenham, England in August 1948,[10]  predated the establishment of the IPPF.
 The IPPF is connecting with the poor and vulnerable population to improve healthcare support. Throughout 2016, the IPPF provided over 45 million people with services, many of these people are in a humanitarian crisis. These services include access to sexual and reproductive health services and training local people to educate others about healthcare. The IPPF help over 46,000 clinics and facilities by giving health products and services. One of their main focuses is on improving sexual health services, so they also give contraceptives to over 14,000 providers, which many are in rural areas. The IPPF is working on helping countries, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa, with HIV epidemics by providing HIV testing and counseling. In 2016, the IPPF supplied over 40 million HIV services, which 59% was delivered to Africa. Africa has seen improvements among HIV and sexually transmitted infections testing and counseling. The IPPF is working along side the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) to promote preventions and treatments.[18]
 In Cairo in 1994, the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) stated that around 55% of couples were family planning in some way. Due to the family planning efforts, fertility rates are three to four children per women in 1994 which is much lower than the average of six to seven children per woman in the 1960s.[19]
 Part of the IPPF in Colombia is Profamilia which was started in 1965. In the 1960s, Colombia was a conservative and Catholic region which valued large families, where the government still does not educate about family planning. Throughout the past 30 years, the fertility rate has decreased from 7 to 3 due to about 70% of the reproductive population using family planning.[19]"
International Republican Institute	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Republican_Institute	"The International Republican Institute (IRI) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan[3][4] organization committed to advancing freedom and democracy worldwide by helping political parties to become more issue-based and responsive, assisting citizens to participate in government planning, and working to increase the role of marginalized groups in the political process – including women and youth. [5]
 Founded in 1983, and initially known as the National Republican Institute for International Affairs, the IRI's stated mission is to ""advance democracy and freedom. We link people with their governments, guide politicians to be responsive to citizens, and motivate people to engage in the political process.""[6]
 The Institute's activities include assisting political parties and candidates develop their values and institutional structures, good governance practices, civil society development, civic education, women's and youth leadership development, electoral reform and election monitoring, and political expression in closed societies. In 2018, U.S. Senator John McCain informed the board of his intention to step down as chair of IRI after 25 years in the role and recommended that U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan succeed him. Senator McCain remained a member of the board.[7]
 IRI has dramatically increased its efforts to bring institutional structure to Arab countries whose social and political fabric was frayed by the Arab Spring.[8] IRI controversially was helping organize Haitian workers and farmers in Haiti prior to the 2004 Haitian coup d'état,[9] organized conservative political parties in Poland from 1991,[10] and has been involved in organizing women in Egypt during and after the Arab Spring.[11]
 The IRI is a non-partisan organization founded in 1983 after U.S. President Ronald Reagan's 1982 speech before the British Parliament in Westminster in which he proposed a broad objective of helping countries build the infrastructure of democracy. Quoting the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, he stated: ""we must be staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings.""[12]
 The Westminster speech led to the establishment of the National Endowment for Democracy by Congress in 1983. The endowment is a mechanism to channel congressional funds to the IRI and three other institutes: the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the American Center for International Labor Solidarity, and the Center for International Private Enterprise.  These organizations provide technical assistance to political bodies worldwide.
 The majority of the IRI's funding comes from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. State Department, and the National Endowment for Democracy.
 At first, IRI focused on democratic institutions and processes in Latin America but has expanded its focus worldwide since the end of the Cold War. IRI has conducted programs in more than 100 countries and is currently active in 70 countries.
 The IRI operates as a political organization abroad, providing training and assistance to favoured political parties.  As a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, it plays no part in domestic U.S. politics.  However, the majority of its board, staff and consultants are drawn from the Republican Party.[13] Its sister organization, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, draws mainly from the Democratic Party.
 In 1995, IRI established the Freedom Award  ""to honor individuals who have worked to advance freedom and democracy in their countries and around the world""[14]
 IRI works with the following organizations:
 It has pursued a nominally neutral agenda, which puts emphasis on promoting the involvement of Indigenous people in the electoral process.
 The IRI is accused of training some of the leaders of the 2004 Haitian coup d'état, as well as funding Farmer's groups in the country in an opposition campaign in the months leading up the removal of Jean-Bertrand Aristide by a coalition of Canada, the US and France.
 The IRI received funding for the Haiti project from USAID for two years (late 2002–2004).[16][17] IRI ended all programming in Haiti in summer 2007.[18]
 The now defunct website http://www.haitigetinvolved.com/ was displaying the IRI logo together with the title ""Haiti Get Involved!""[19] from about 2003 until mid-2005, and to be offering news, analysis, reports, documents and training manuals as well as information on the upcoming election and a list of political parties.
 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television premiered a documentary film about the IRI's role in the coup, Haiti: Democracy Undone, on 29 January 2006.[9]
 Freedom of Information Act documents show that the IRI was involved in training and supporting pro-coup opposition parties.[20]
 IRI was accused by former US Ambassador Brian Dean Curran of undermining his efforts to hold peaceful negotiations between Aristide and his opposition after contested senatorial elections in 2000. According to Curran, Stanley Lucas, then IRI's representative in Haiti, advised opposition leaders not to compromise with Aristide, who would soon be driven from power. Curran also alleged that Lucas represented himself to the opposition as the true envoy of Washington, and his advice—which was contrary to that of the State Department—as advice from the American government.[21] IRI responded to Ambassador Curran's allegations in a letter to the New York Times, stating:
 'Mixed U.S. Signals Helped Tilt Haiti Toward Chaos' (front page, Jan. 29) found support for some of former Ambassador Brian Dean Curran's charges among only a few Haitians, most of them former associates of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. All have obvious motivation to impugn the International Republican Institute's work, and none presented any evidence to back their accusations.[22]  Otto Reich, who was the State Department's top official on Latin America under Colin Powell, described a change in US policy toward Haiti with the arrival of the Bush administration. According to Reich, Aristide fell somewhat out of favor with the change of US executive, though Powell continued to publicly profess U.S. support for the democratically elected leader. Curran's allegations were corroborated by Luigi R. Einaudi of the Organization of American States.[21]
 The Cuban government accuses former Congressional staffer Caleb McCarry of orchestrating the 2004 Haitian coup and attempting to provoke a coup d'état in Cuba.[23] An anonymous State Department source told a Salon.com journalist that the funds McCarry allegedly used in Haiti came from the IRI.[24]
 The IRI has been accused of supporting the 2009 Honduran coup d'état. The IRI refuses to term the event as such and calls it a ""constitutional crisis"". The IRI received $550,000 from the National Endowment for Democracy in 2009 in order to ""promote and enhance the participation of think tanks in Mexico and Honduras as 'pressure groups' to impel political parties to develop concrete positions on key issues"", and to ""support initiatives to implement political positions during the campaigns in 2009"" following the coup.[25][failed verification]
 The IRI program in Poland began in 1991 and claims credit for having united and organised a diverse range of ""center and center right-wing"" political parties together to create the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS), which was in government in Poland, together with its coalition partner the Freedom Union (UW) party, from 1997 to 2001.[10] It claims having provided training in political campaigning, communications training and research which helped organise and create the AWS. It also claims that once the AWS was in government, it organised an advertising campaign for the Polish government in order to stop the AWS splitting up over internal tensions:[10]
 IRI initiated a post-election program that emphasized media and communications training for Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's chancellory and cabinet. According to an April 2011 New York Times article, the IRI, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and other groups were credited for training activists in the Middle East, specifically Egypt and Tunisia, who were advocating for reform in authoritarian regimes.
 The money spent on these programs was minute compared with efforts led by the Pentagon. But as American officials and others look back at the uprisings of the Arab Spring, they are seeing that the United States' democracy-building campaigns played a bigger role in fomenting protests than was previously known, with key leaders of the movements having been trained by the Americans in campaigning, organizing through new media tools and monitoring elections. 
 A number of the groups and individuals directly involved in the revolts and reforms sweeping the region, including the April 6 Youth Movement in Egypt, the Bahrain Center for Human Rights and grass-roots activists like Entsar Qadhi, a youth leader in Yemen, received training and financing from groups like the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute and Freedom House, a nonprofit human rights organization based in Washington, according to interviews in recent weeks and American diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks.[26]
 A ministry of justice's report on foreign funding of NGOs in Egypt has revealed that IRI in Egypt has received funding of about 7 million dollars by USAID for the Egyptian 2011–12 elections. The military rulers who gained control of the country following the January 2011 revolution consider this foreign funding interference in internal affairs.[11]
 In September 2017, Daniel Twining was named IRI's president. He replaced Mark Green, who was confirmed as USAID Administrator in August 2017 after leading IRI since February 2014. IRI's former president, Lorne Craner, assumed leadership on August 2, 2004. From 2001 to 2004, Craner served as Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor at the US State Department."
International Resources for the Improvement of Sight	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Resources_for_the_Improvement_of_Sight	"International Resources for the Improvement of Sight (IRIS) is an International NGO that specializes in prevention of blindness and restoration of sight.[1] It was founded in 1996 by Michele Claudel and John Stewart.[2] It was initially founded to help people in Cambodia without access to eye care, it has since expanded to Nepal, Lao PDR and Sri Lanka. IRIS equips new eye clinics, strengthens existing ones, conducts eye screening, provides cataract surgery for poor people, primary eye care training for staff.[2]
 IRIS has partnered with other NGOs to provide funding for services, such as with The Vision Charity in Sri Lanka.[3] IRIS has also partnered with the Cambodian government program National Program for Eye Health in establishing eye clinics.[4] Another partner is the International Centre for Eyecare Education.[5]
 As of December 2008, the combined total of IRIS clinic and eye camp programs since its inception in Cambodia had resulted in 125,319 people receiving eye examinations and 23,485 surgeries being performed free of charge, 15,291 of which were to remove cataracts.[1]
 In 2011, Roger Freeland Biggs was the CEO of IRIS and he was awarded an OBE ""for services to Health in Asia"".[6]"
International Union for Conservation of Nature	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature	"The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; officially International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources[2]) is an international organization working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. It is involved in data gathering and analysis, research, field projects, advocacy, and education. IUCN's mission is to ""influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable"".
 Over the past decades, IUCN has widened its focus beyond conservation ecology and now incorporates issues related to sustainable development in its projects. IUCN does not itself aim to mobilize the public in support of nature conservation. It tries to influence the actions of governments, business and other stakeholders by providing information and advice, and through building partnerships. The organization is best known to the wider public for compiling and publishing the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, which assesses the conservation status of species worldwide.[3]
 IUCN has a membership of over 1400 governmental and non-governmental organizations. Some 16,000 scientists and experts participate in the work of IUCN commissions on a voluntary basis. It employs approximately 1000 full-time staff in more than 50 countries. Its headquarters are in Gland, Switzerland.[3]
 IUCN has observer and consultative status at the United Nations and plays a role in the implementation of several international conventions on nature conservation and biodiversity.  It was involved in establishing the World Wide Fund for Nature and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre. In the past, IUCN has been criticized for placing the interests of nature over those of indigenous peoples. In recent years, its closer relations with the business sector have caused controversy.[4][5]
 IUCN was established in 1948. It was previously called the International Union for the Protection of Nature (1948–1956) and the World Conservation Union (1990–2008).
 [nb 1]
 Establishment[6]:16–38
 IUCN was established on 5 October 1948, in Fontainebleau, France, when representatives of governments and conservation organizations spurred by UNESCO signed a formal act constituting the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUPN).
 At the time of its founding IUPN was the only international organisation focusing on the entire spectrum of nature conservation (an international organisation for the protection of birds, now BirdLife International, had been established in 1922.)
 Early years: 1948–1956[6]:47–63
IUPN started out with 65 members in Brussels and was closely associated to UNESCO. They jointly organized the 1949 Conference on Protection of Nature (Lake Success, USA and drafted the first list of Gravely endangered species. In the early years of its existence IUCN depended almost entirely on UNESCO funding and was forced to temporarily scale down activities when this ended unexpectedly in 1954.
 In 1956, IUPN changed its name to International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.
 Increased profile and recognition: 1956–1965[6]:67–82
During this period, the IUCN expanded its relations with UN-agencies and established links with the Council of Europe. IUCN's best known publication, the Red Data Book on the conservation status of species, was first published in 1964.
 
IUCN began to play a part in the development of international treaties and conventions, starting with the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.  Africa was the focus of many of the early IUCN conservation field projects. IUCN supported the ‘Yellowstone model’ of protected area management, which severely restricted human presence and activity in order to protect nature.[4]
 To establish a stable financial basis for its work, IUCN participated in setting up the World Wildlife Fund (1961) (now the World Wide Fund for Nature WWF) to work on fundraising to cover part of the operational costs of IUCN. Also in 1961, the IUCN headquarters moved from Belgium to Morges in Switzerland.
 Consolidating its position in the international environmental movement: 1966–1975[6]:110–124
During the 1960s, IUCN lobbied the UN General Assembly to create a new status for NGOs. Resolution 1296, adopted in 1968, granted 'consultative' status to NGOs. IUCN itself was eventually accredited with six UN organizations.[7] IUCN was one of the few environmental organisations formally involved in the preparations of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972). IUCN co-drafted the World Heritage Convention with UNESCO and has been involved as the official Advisory Body on nature from the onset.[8]
 IUCN entered into an agreement with the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP to provide regular reviews of world conservation. The income this generated, combined with growing revenue via WWF, put the organisation on relatively sound financial footing for the first time since 1948.
 This period saw the beginning of a gradual change in IUCN's approach to conservation in which it tried to become more appealing to the developing world.
 
The World Conservation Strategy 1975–1985[6]:132–165
In 1975 IUCN started work on the World Conservation Strategy. 
 In 1980, IUCN and WWF moved into shared new offices in Gland, Switzerland. This marked a phase of closer cooperation with WWF, but the close ties between IUCN and WWF were severed in 1985 when WWF decided to take control of its own field projects, which so far had been run by IUCN.
 Sustainable development and regionalisation: 1985 to present day[6]:176–222
In 1982, IUCN set up a Conservation for Development Centre within its secretariat. The Centre undertook projects to ensure that nature conservation was integrated in development aid and in the economic policies of developing countries. Over the years, it supported the development of national conservation strategies in 30 countries. Several European countries began to channel considerable amounts of bilateral aid via IUCN's projects. Management of these projects was primarily done by IUCN staff, often working from the new regional and country offices IUCN set up around the world. This marked a shift within the organisation. Previously, the volunteer Commissions had been very influential, now the Secretariat and its staff began to play a more dominant role. In 1989, IUCN moved into a separate building in Gland, close to the offices it had shared with WWF. Initially, the focus of power was still with the Headquarters in Gland but the regional offices and regional members’ groups gradually got a bigger say in operations.
 In 1991, IUCN (together with UNEP and WWF) published Caring for the Earth, a successor to the World Conservation Strategy.[7]
 Social aspects of conservation were now integrated in IUCN's work; at the General Assembly in 1994 the IUCN mission was redrafted to its current wording to include the equitable and ecologically use of natural resources.
 Closer to business: 2000 to present day
Since the creation of IUCN in 1948, IUCN Members have passed more than 300 resolutions that include or focus on business related activities. 
 The increased attention on sustainable development as a means to protect nature brought IUCN closer to the corporate sector. The members decided against this, but IUCN did forge a partnership with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. IUCN renewed a multi-year MOU with them with WBCSD in December 2015.
 In 1996, after decades of seeking to address specific business issues, IUCN's Members asked for a comprehensive approach to engaging the business sector. Resolution 1.81 of the IUCN World Conservation Congress held that year “urged IUCN Members and the Director General, based on the need to influence private sector policies in support of the Mission of IUCN, to expand dialogue and productive relationships with the private sector and find new ways to interact with members of the business community”.
 The IUCN Global Business and Biodiversity Program (BBP) was established in 2003 to influence and support private partners in addressing environmental and social issues.[9] In 2004, the first IUCN Private Sector Engagement Strategy was developed (in response to Council Decision C/58/41). Most prominent in the Business and Biodiversity Program is the five-year collaboration IUCN started with the energy company Shell International in 2007.[10][11]
 Today, the Business and Biodiversity Programme continues to set the strategic direction, coordinate IUCN's overall approach and provide institutional quality assurance in all business engagements. The Programme ensures that the Business Engagement Strategy is implemented through IUCN's global thematic and regional programmes as well as helps guide the work of IUCN's six Commissions.
 Championing Nature-based Solutions: 2009 to present day
 Nature-based Solutions (NbS) use ecosystems and the services they provide to address societal challenges such as climate change, food security or natural disasters.[12]
 The emergence of the NbS concept in environmental sciences and nature conservation contexts came as international organisations, such as IUCN and the World Bank, searched for solutions to work with ecosystems rather than relying on conventional engineering interventions (such as seawalls), to adapt to and mitigate climate change effects, while improving sustainable livelihoods and protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity.
 At the IUCN World Conservation Congress 2016, IUCN Members agreed on a definition of nature-based solutions.[13] Members also called for governments to include nature-based solutions in strategies to combat climate change.
 Timeline Some key dates in the growth and development of IUCN:
 According to its website, IUCN works on the following themes: business, climate change, economics, ecosystems, environmental law, forest conservation, gender, global policy, marine and polar, protected areas, science and knowledge, social policy, species, water and world heritage.[14]
 IUCN works on the basis of four-year programs, determined by the membership. In the IUCN Programme for 2017–2020 conserving nature and biodiversity is linked to sustainable development and poverty reduction.  IUCN states that it aims to have a solid factual base for its work and takes into account the knowledge held by indigenous groups and other traditional users of natural resources.
 The IUCN Programme 2017–2020 identifies three priority areas:[15]
 1. Valuing and conserving nature.
 2. Promoting and supporting effective and equitable governance of natural resources
 3. Deploying Nature Based Solutions to address societal challenges including climate change, food security and economic and social development.[15]
 IUCN does not itself aim to directly mobilize the general public.  Education has been part of IUCN's work program since the early days but the focus is on stakeholder involvement and strategic communication rather than mass-campaigns.[16]
 IUCN runs field projects for habitat and species conservation around the world. It produces the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems  is applicable at local, national, regional and global levels.
 IUCN' stated goal is to expand the global network of national parks and other protected areas and promote good management of such areas.[17][18]  In particular, it focuses on greater protection of the oceans and marine habitats.
 IUCN has a growing program of partnerships with the corporate sector on a regional, national, and international level to promote sustainable use of natural resources.[19]
 On the national level, IUCN helps governments prepare national biodiversity policies. Internationally, IUCN provides advice to environmental conventions such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, CITES and the Framework Convention on Climate Change. It advises UNESCO on natural world heritage.
It has a formally accredited permanent observer mission to the United Nations.[15]
IUCN has official relations with the multiple other international bodies.[20]
 As an organization, IUCN has three components: the member organizations, the six scientific commissions, and the secretariat.
 
IUCN Members are states (making IUCN a supranational GONGO), government agencies, international nongovernmental organizations, national nongovernmental organizations, and indigenous peoples’ organisations. In 2017, IUCN had 1400 members.[21] The members can organize themselves in national or regional committees to promote cooperation. In 2016, there were 62 national committees and 7 regional committees.[22]  The six IUCN Commissions involve volunteer experts from a range of disciplines. They 'assess the state of the world's natural resources and provide the Union with sound know-how and policy advice on conservation issues'.[23]
 The IUCN head office is in Gland, Switzerland. Eight regional offices headed by a director implement IUCN's program in their respective territories. Since 1980, IUCN has established offices in more than 50 countries.[24]
 The World Conservation Congress (Members’ Assembly) is IUCN's highest decision-making body. The Congress convenes every four years. It elects the Council, including the President, and approves IUCN's workprogram for the next four years, and budget.
 The IUCN Council is the principal governing body of IUCN. The Council provides strategic direction for the activities of the Union, discusses specific policy issues and provides guidance on finance and the membership development of the Union. The Council is composed of the President, four Vice Presidents (elected by the Council from among its members), the Treasurer, the Chairs of IUCN's six Commissions, three Regional Councillors from each of IUCN's eight Statutory Regions and a Councillor from the State in which IUCN has its seat (Switzerland).  IUCN's current President is Zhang Xinsheng.
 The Council appoints a Director General, who is responsible for the overall management of IUCN and the running of the Secretariat. Grethel Aguilar is IUCN Director General a.i. since January 2015.[25] She succeeded Inger Andersen .[26]

 IUCN Directors General since 1948[27]
 IUCN's total income in 2013 was 114 million CHF, equaling approximately 95 million Euro or 116 million US dollar.
IUCN's funding mainly comes from Official Development Assistance budgets of bilateral and multilateral agencies. This represented 61% of its income in 2013. Additional sources of income are the membership fees, as well as grants and project funding from foundations, institutions and corporations.[28]
 
It has been claimed that IUCN put the needs of nature above those of humans, disregarding economic considerations and the interests of indigenous peoples and other traditional users of the land. Until the 1980s IUCN favored the ""Yellowstone Model’ of conservation which called for the removal of humans from protected areas. The expulsion of the Maasai people from Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area is perhaps the best known example of this approach.[4][6] This is linked to another criticism that has been directed at IUCN, namely that throughout its history it has mainly been ‘Northern focused’, i.e. had a West-European or North-American perspective on global conservation.  Some critics point to the fact that many individuals involved in the establishment of IUCN had been leading figures in the British Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of Empire, which wanted to protect species against the impact of ‘native’ hunting pressure in order to safeguard hunting by Europeans.[29] The fact that, at least until the 1990s,  most of IUCN staff, the chairs of the Commissions and the IUCN President came from western countries has also led to criticism.[6]
 More recently, activist environmental groups have argued that IUCN is too closely associated with governmental organisations and with the commercial sector.[30]  IUCN's cooperation with Shell came in for criticism, also from its own membership.[11] IUCN's close partnership with Coca-Cola in Vietnam – where they have together been launching Coca-Cola-focused community centers – has also drawn some criticism and allegations of greenwashing.[31][32][33] Its decision to hold the 2012 World Conservation Congress on Jeju Island, South Korea, where the local community and international environmental activists were protesting against the construction of a navy base also led to controversy.[34]
 IUCN has a wide range of publications, reports, guidelines and databases related to conservation and sustainable development. It publishes or co-authors more than 100 books and major assessments every year, along with hundreds of reports, documents and guidelines.[35] In 2015, 76 IUCN articles were published in peer reviewed scientific journals.[36]
 A report, released at the IUCN World Parks Congress in Sydney on 13 November 2014 showed that the 209,000 conservation reserves around the world now cover 15.4 per cent of the total land area. This is a step towards protecting 17 percent of land and 10 percent of ocean environments on Earth by 2020 since an agreement between the world's nations at the Convention on Biological Diversity, held in Japan in 2010.[37]"
"Invisible Children, Inc."	"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Children,_Inc."	"Invisible Children, Inc. is an organization founded in 2004 to increase awareness of the activities of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in Central Africa, and its leader, Joseph Kony. Specifically, the group seeks to put an end to the practices of the LRA, which include abductions and abuse of children, and forcing them to serve as soldiers. To this end, Invisible Children urges the United States government to take military action in the central region of Africa.  Invisible Children also operates as a charitable organization, soliciting donations and selling merchandise to raise money for its cause. The organization promotes its cause by dispensing films on the internet and presenting in high schools and colleges around the United States.
 When the organization was founded, the LRA was active in Uganda. The rebel group left Uganda in 2006 and continues to operate in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan. Invisible Children advocated for the passing of the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act, a piece of legislation which led to the deployment of 100 combat-equipped US soldiers to the region for the purpose of advising the local forces in tracking and capturing Joseph Kony. The United Nations Security Council met in November of that year to discuss the LRA. Internationally, journalists began to seek more information about the conditions in Central Africa at that time.
 The group has received both praise and criticism for its methods. While the organization's films have won several awards, its use of funds, projection of facts, and support of the SPLA and the Ugandan Army have come into question as these two groups have been known to commit similar atrocities to those blamed on the LRA. In March 2012, Invisible Children began an only video campaign called Kony 2012,  the purpose being to promote the charity's 'Stop Kony' movement to make indicted Ugandan war criminal Joseph Kony internationally known in order to arrest him in 2012.[3] Foreign Policy in 2017 reported that Invisible Children had become closely connected with military operations including intelligence gathering.[4]
 In 1985, Ugandan dictator Apolo Milton Obote (December 28, 1925 – October 10, 2005) was overthrown by his own military commanders. Although he was from the Lango ethnic group, the soldiers who made up his army were primarily from the Acholi region, in northern Uganda. He was replaced by Tito Okello (1914–1996), the president of Uganda who was Acholi. Okello was deposed in 1986 and the leader of the National Resistance Army, Yoweri Museveni became president, after questionable elections.[5] The Acholi were resistant to the authority of the new president who ""launched a brutal search-and-destroy mission against former government soldiers throughout the north, which swept up many innocent Acholi in its wake.[5]
 Several resistance groups emerged and most were put down, but the LRA survived. In the early 2000s, media attention was drawn to the region when thousands of children affected by the LRA activities took refuge in Gulu, Uganda. The government of Uganda forced the Acholi into ""what were effectively concentration camps"".[6] These camps were ridden with disease and the inhabitants were not able to continue farming.[5]
 The attention the conditions in Uganda received revealed that over the previous 20 years the LRA was abducting children and using them as kadogo (child soldiers), a practice in which the Museveni government had also engaged. In 2005, an arrest warrant was issued for Joseph Kony by the International Criminal Court ""for crimes against humanity and war crimes"".[5]
 After failed peace negotiations with the Ugandan government in 2006, the LRA left Uganda retreating to southern Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic, where they continued to ""wreak havoc"".[5] In May 2010, President Barack Obama signed the ""Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act"". This law led to the deployment of US troops in the region in October, 2011. Shortly thereafter, the United Nations Security Council met to discuss the LRA. Internationally, journalists set out to inform themselves about the conditions in the region.[6]
 With the intent to film a documentary about the War in Darfur, college students Jason Russell, Bobby Bailey, and Laren Poole traveled to Africa in 2003.[7] Russell had recently graduated from film school at the University of Southern California, and after witnessing gunmen shoot at the truck in front of him while driving in northern Uganda, he discovered Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army.[8] After the incident, the group decided instead to focus on the civil war affecting the region. After returning home to the United States, the group created a documentary titled Invisible Children: The Rough Cut, which aims to expose the plight of child soldiers and night commuters of northern Uganda.[9] The film was originally shown to the group's friends and family, but eventually reached millions.[9] The three believed that the world was unaware of the conditions in Uganda and the plight of the children they met there.
 The young men set out on a mission to expose what they had witnessed in Uganda, screening their film at hundreds of high schools, colleges, and churches throughout the United States.[10] In 2004 the group founded Invisible Children, Inc. as a non-profit charitable organization.[7] They solicit donations and sell merchandise such as bracelets, T-shirts, and posters to raise money for their cause.[11] The money they raise is used in part, to produce awareness films, and for humanitarian aid to northern Uganda.[12]
 In April 2007, the group organized an event called ""Displace Me"", in which 67,000 activists throughout the United States slept in the streets in makeshift cardboard villages, hoping to raise awareness about those displaced by the Ugandan government.[13] Later in 2007, American rock band Fall Out Boy filmed a music video for the song ""I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get You Off (Me & You)"" in Uganda after hearing of the organization's cause.[14] Fall Out Boy originally intended to create a documentary-style film, but decided to focus on a love story between two Ugandan children, opining that the treatment ""seemed a lot more dangerous and compelling. I mean, have you ever seen a love story between Ugandan people—especially with a rock band—on 'TRL'?""[14] Invisible Children co-founder Bobby Bailey referred to the video as ""groundbreaking"".[14]
 Although the LRA left Uganda in 2006 after failed peace negotiations with the government, in March 2012, Invisible Children, Inc. continued to create new awareness programs. In May 2010, President Barack Obama signed the ""Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act"". Invisible Children was one of the advocacy groups that influenced the passing of the bill.[12] Representatives of Invisible Children and other groups were present in the Oval Office when the President Barack Obama signed the law. The President told those in attendance ""We have seen your reporting, your websites, your blogs, and your video postcards. You have made the plight of the children visible to us all.""[12]
 In March 2012, Invisible Children began an internet video campaign called Kony 2012,[5] the premise of which was to heighten awareness of the actions of Kony and the LRA in order to put further pressure on the U.S. government to intervene militarily in Central Africa. The campaign focused on ""making Kony famous"" in order to awaken people to his crimes and the pressure the government into military actions.[15] The production value of the film was praised and it was suggested that the methodology used would be a trend in activism in the future.[12]   The video went viral, reaching more than 40 million views in three days after being tweeted by celebrities such as Rihanna, Oprah Winfrey, and Ryan Seacrest.[16] Immediately following the release and success of the internet films in the Kony 2012 program, criticism of the organization's activities and finances surfaced.[12]
 In an article analyzing why the Obama administration sent US troops to Central Africa in October, 2011, the Council on Foreign Relations (C.F.R.) criticized groups like Invisible Children for ""manipulat[ing] facts for strategic purposes, exaggerating the scale of LRA abductions and murders"".[6] Resolve, one of Invisible Children's partner organizations addressed the Council on Foreign Relations' accusation as a ""serious charge...published with no accompanying substantiation.""[17]  Jedidiah Jenkins, the director of idea development for Invisible Children, asserted that the numbers of child abductions the charity uses ""are often the same numbers as the ones used by Human Rights Watch and the United Nations"".[18]
 The C.F.R. article went on to say that organizations such as Invisible Children ""rarely refer to the Ugandan atrocities or those of Sudan's People's Liberation Army.""[6] These ideas were echoed in the Huffington Post by Michael Deibert, author of Democratic Republic of Congo: Between Hope and Despair. Deibert further explained that the Ugandan government itself used child soldiers to gain power.[5] The Washington Post brought up criticism of the organization for its role in the passing of the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act. The law was designed to help bring peace and stability to the region, however, according to the article, ""[Critics say] it has strengthened the hand of the Ugandan president, whose security forces have a human rights abuse record of their own"".[18]  In response, Jenkins said, ""If we had the purity to say we will not partner with anyone corrupt, we couldn't partner with anyone.""[18]
 The organization has been criticized for oversimplifying a complex and multi-faceted issue. Of major concern is that US troops are already deployed in an operation that should be secret. The attention that is being brought the region now may actually do harm. It is assumed that Joseph Kabila, the President of the Congo, would not respond favorably to foreign troops crossing his borders. For this reason, the attention that the Kony 2012 film is bringing could incite violence. ""If you want to catch Kony, I can't think of a dumber thing to do,""[11] said Africa expert, Peter Pham. Following the release of the film Kony 2012, the group asserted that it hoped to explain the conflict in ""an easily understandable format"", with CEO Ben Keesey adding that ""There are few times where problems are black and white. There's lots of complicated stuff in the world, but Joseph Kony and what he's doing is black and white.""[19]
 Scrutiny of the distribution of the organization's funds have also emerged, specifically due to information reported by charity watch group, Charity Navigator. Charity Navigator currently has Invisible Children rated three out of four stars overall (two out of four in the category of ""financial"" and four out of four in the category of ""accountability and transparency"").[20] Other critics claimed that the group spends most of the money they collect from their charity on staff salaries and ""making films that attract much publicity, but don't do much to help people on the ground.""[12] The organization responded to critiques of its spending by providing a breakdown of its finances on its website, which claimed that 80.46% of its money raised was spent on ""its mission"", with 16% going to administration and management costs.[11]
 Another locus for criticism of the organization has been a photograph of the three founders holding weapons and posing with armed members of the SPLA.[21] Invisible Children responded on their website with founder Jason Russell explaining that it was a joke photo taken at the 2008 Juba Peace Talks in the Democratic Republic of Congo that would have been ""funny to bring back to our friends and family"".[22] Glenna Gordon, the photographer who took the picture, is not associated with the organization and was on assignment for the Associated Press at the time. Gordon explained the context of the photograph as the Invisible Children founders being bored at the stalled peace talks and deciding to have some fun posing with weapons and SPLA members. Gordon later published a story about what she saw as their questionable practices.[23]
 The organization's founding was catalyzed by Invisible Children, the documentary that the founders filmed and edited in 2003."
Islamic Relief	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Relief	"Islamic Relief is an international aid agency that provides humanitarian relief and development programmes in over 30 countries, serving communities in need regardless of race, political affiliation, gender or belief.
 Founded in 1984 in the UK, it has international headquarters in Birmingham (Islamic Relief Worldwide) and a network of national offices, affiliated partners, registered branches and field offices spanning 50 countries. Its income in 2018 was £128 million,[2] and it is the largest independent international aid agency inspired by Islamic humanitarian values.
 Islamic Relief's key areas of work are humanitarian relief and disaster preparedness; development programmes that improve access to sustainable livelihoods, healthcare, education, water, sanitation and hygiene; and advocating on behalf of those in need.[3]
 Islamic Relief states as its vision and mission:[4]
 “Inspired by our Islamic faith and guided by our values, we envisage a caring world where communities are empowered, social obligations are fulfilled and people respond as one to the suffering of others.
 We work to provide lasting routes out of poverty, empowering people to transform their lives and serving all communities without prejudice.”
 According to Islamic Relief's Global Strategy 2017–2021[5] document the organisation's four global goals are:
 IRW is a member of the UN's Economic and Social Council and it is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGO s in Disaster Relief. It is also a member of Bond (British Overseas NGOs for Development) and in the UK, a member of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), along with 14 other charities.
 IRW is co-owner of the International Civil Society Centre, a global action platform, and an affiliate member of the INGO Accountability Charter Company.
 The organisation states that its key partners include WFP, IDB, UNHCR, UNOCHA, EC, DFID, UNDP, OIC, Sida, Bahrain RCO, START Network, ROTA, and CAFOD.
 Islamic Relief is part of the global Make Poverty History coalition which is campaigning to end extreme poverty and the Beyond 2015 coalition, which aims to influence the development framework which will replace the Millennium Development Goals. It has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to co-operate in humanitarian work with Lutheran World Federation(LWF)[6] and also formed a partnership with the African Union to tackle chronic poverty.
 The Charity is also the parent body to ""Charity Week"", which claims to be the largest student run project globally.
 Also according to Islamic Relief's Global Strategy 2017–2021 document the organisation states their values and teachings are provided by the revelations contained within the Qur'an and Prophetic example. They are Ikhlas (sincerity), Ihsan (excellence), Rahma (compassion), Adl (social justice) and Amana (custodianship).
 Islamic Relief was established in 1984 by Dr Hany El-Banna and fellow students from the University of Birmingham in response to a famine in the Horn of Africa. Its first donation was 20p, raised from door-to-door collections.[7] The charity grew with strong grassroots community support and over the past 35 years has grown to with affiliated organisations raising funds across Europe, America, Australia and elsewhere.
 In 2017,[2] Islamic Relief reported an income of £126 million which includes individual donations and institutional funding from DFID, UN agencies, USAID, and other partners. Inspired by Islamic humanitarian values, it works with Muslim and non-Muslim communities around the world. The charity registered with the Charity Commission of England and Wales in 1989 and remains an independent non-political non-governmental organisation (NGO).
 Islamic Relief has been responding to humanitarian crises around the world for the past 35 years with an aim to reduce the impact of conflicts and natural disasters. It focuses on ensuring rapid response, providing emergency relief and protecting vulnerable people. It also helps communities prepare for disaster, making them more resilient, and influences government disaster risk reduction programmes.
 Islamic Relief's key emergency interventions in its 35-year history include providing life-saving aid during the wars in Bosnia and Kosova in the 1990s,[8] providing medical assistance during the wars in Afghanistan[9] and Iraq,[10] and managing refugee camps in Darfur, Sudan.[11] It has also responded to natural disasters including the 2004 Asian tsunami,[12] the Kashmir earthquake in 2005[13] and drought in the Horn of Africa.[14]
 The charity's current emergency appeals include supporting 2.5 million people at risk of famine and disease in Yemen,[15] assisting vulnerable communities affected by the ongoing violence in Myanmar, and delivering aid to 1.4 million people in war-torn Syria,[16] including in Idlib where it is one of the few aid agencies still operating directly.  
 Islamic Relief also runs an annual global Ramadan and Qurbani food distribution programme reaching millions of food-insecure people.[17]
 Islamic Relief's development programmes aim to empower communities to emerge from poverty and become less vulnerable. It focuses on providing long-term sustainability including climate adaptation, livelihood support including Islamic microfinance and orphan sponsorship programmes. In 2001 it set up Waqf programmes,[18] supported by donors and run as an Islamic endowment scheme.
 In 2006 Islamic Relief signed a Programme Partnership Agreement with the UK government's Department for International Development, recognising the charity's capacity to contribute to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Its current development strategy is aligned to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
 In 2017, Islamic Relief reports to have supported 4.3 million people in 34 countries with its development programmes. During the year it provided 16,500 people with microfinance loans to improve their livelihoods, ensured 48,000 people had better access to education, increased long-term food security for 208,000 people and gave over 900,000 people access to water, sanitation, hygiene and healthcare services.
 Also in 2017, Islamic Relief ran a peace-building programme with Muslim and Christian communities in the Central African Republic as part of an interfaith consortium with Catholic Relief Services, World Vision International and Aegis Trust. The programme directly benefited over 2,000 people, improving social cohesion and livelihood security.[19]
 In August 2015 Islamic Relief launched an Islamic Climate Change Declaration[20] with GreenFaith and the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental and Sciences, calling on Muslim communities to take an active role in climate action at local, national and international levels. The Declaration makes an Islamic faith-endorsed case for protecting the environment with support from global Muslim leaders. It was launched at the Istanbul Symposium and presented at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP 21). In 2017, Islamic Relief implemented 50 projects worldwide to reduce the impact of climate change.[19]
 In 2018, at the UN Commission on the Status of Women conference in New York (CSW62) Islamic Relief announced a forthcoming Islamic Declaration on Gender Justice.[21] The Declaration is a call to action against gender inequality from an Islamic faith perspective, and seeks to tackle discrimination and harmful practices, especially against women and girls in Muslim communities. Consultations on the Declaration are currently taking place among faith leaders, NGOs, UN agencies and grassroots community groups. The Declaration is part of Islamic Relief's gender justice work which includes tackling early and forced marriage, domestic violence and female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C).
 TIC International[22] is a trading subsidiary of Islamic Relief. It supports they charity's fundraising activities by recycling clothes and running 14 charity shops across the UK.
 Formerly known as the Islamic Relief Academy, the Humanitarian Academy for Development[23] re-launched in 2018 as a centre for learning and research to benefit the humanitarian sector.
 Islamic Relief is a member of the UN's Economic and Social Council and is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief. It is also a member of Bond (British Overseas NGOs for Development) and in the UK, a member of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), along with 14 other major charities.
 Islamic Relief is co-owner of the International Civil Society Centre, a global action platform, and an affiliate member of the INGO Accountability Charter Company. In 2017 it acquired Core Humanitarian Standard certification.
 In its Annual Report 2017[19] Islamic Relief lists its key partners as Age International, African Union, Bayt Al Zakat, CAFOD, Confederation Suisse, the UK government's Department for International Development (DFID), Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), European Commission, Finn Church Aid, International Islamic Charity Organisation, Iraqi Red Crescent Society, Islamic Development Bank (IDB), Jordan Hashemite Charity Organisation, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Philips, Reach Out To Asia (ROTA), Sheikh Abdullah Al Nouri Charity Society, Swedish International Development Agency (Sida), START Network, The Lutheran World Federation, UNDP, UNHCR, UNWFP, UN Women, USAID and World Vision.
 
 In June 2014, Israel added Islamic Relief to a list of organisations banned from operating in Israel, for allegedly funding Hamas. The charity's West Bank offices were raided and their computers were destroyed, files were confiscated, and an office safe was forcibly opened.. In late 2014, Islamic Relief claimed[24] that an audit carried out by an unnamed ""leading global audit firm"" found no evidence of any link to terrorism. The Israeli government responded by claiming its decision to declare Islamic Relief illegal was ""based on information that has been accumulated over years, that the fund is a central player in financing of Hamas"". The organisation has challenged the decision in the Israeli courts.[25]
 Consequently, on 15 November 2014, the United Arab Emirates placed Islamic Relief on a list of proscribed organisations due to alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood.[16][17]The organisation denies any links to the Muslim Brotherhood[26] citing the organisation's neutral stance and humanitarian nature.
 In 2016, it was reported that the banking group HSBC decided to sever ties with Islamic Relief over concerns that ""cash meant for humanitarian aid could potentially end up with terrorist groups abroad"".[27] HSBC invited Islamic Relief to ""end the relationship"", which the bank did in any case at the end of 2014, as it has with other aid and civil society organisations.[28]
 The government of Bangladesh barred the organisation from aiding the Rohingya people in Cox's Bazar, alleging funds were used to preach Islam, construct mosques, encourage radicalism, and fund militants.[23] Islamic Relief refutes these allegations and continues it work across Bangladesh, where it has been present for over 25 years.[29]"
ISSO Seva	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISSO_Seva	"ISSO Seva was established in 2001.[1] It is an independent running charity under International Swaminarayan Satsang Organisation of the Swaminarayan Sampraday that has been established to give a helping hand to mankind, help the homeless and needy as well as spreading awareness about the modern day diseases and infections.[1]

J. Paul Getty Trust	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Paul_Getty_Trust	"The J. Paul Getty Trust is one of world's wealthiest art institutions with an estimated endowment in 2017 of $US 6.9 billion.[2]  Based in Los Angeles, California, it operates the J. Paul Getty Museum, which has two locations, the Getty Center in Los Angeles and the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades district of Los Angeles, California. Its other programs are the Getty Foundation, the Getty Research Institute, and the Getty Conservation Institute.
 With an estimated 1.6 million visitors per year, the trust operates one of the most visited museums in the United States. The trust also provides grants and training to other museums and cultural institutions. The trust has a library, publications program and visiting scholar program. The trust's conservation program is dedicated to advancing conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge. However, since 2008, the trust has scaled back the scope of its activities in response to financial challenges.
 The J. Paul Getty Museum Trust was established by oilman J. Paul Getty in 1953. Getty founded the Getty Oil Company, and in 1957 Fortune magazine named him the richest living American.[3] At his death, he was worth more than $2 billion.[4]  Getty died in 1976[5] and left the bulk of his estate, including nearly $660 million worth of stock in Getty Oil, to the J. Paul Getty Museum Trust. Legal conflicts over the will took years to resolve, but in 1982 the trust finally received Getty's full bequest. The trust began to add a number of new programs in 1982, and in February 1983, it petitioned the court to change its name to the J. Paul Getty Trust.[6]
 In 1997 Barry Munitz was named the president and CEO of the trust.[7] He began work in January 1998, succeeding Harold M. Williams, the first president of the Getty Trust, who oversaw construction of the $1 billion Getty Center designed by architect Richard Meier.[8]  With an endowment of $4.2 billion, the Getty Trust is the wealthiest art institution in the world.[9]  Early in his tenure, Munitz reorganized the Getty Trust, closing two of the institution's six programs—the Getty Information Institute and the Getty Education Institute. To deal with long-run financial issues, he sought to cultivate relationships with donors and corporate partners. His leadership became increasingly controversial as the Getty Trust was embroiled in numerous controversies relating to the provenance of various antiquities in the Getty Museum's collections and Munitz' expense account. In the midst of an investigation by the California Attorney General,[10]
Munitz resigned in 2006 and was forced to ""forgo his severance package of more than $2 million, and reimburse the Getty Trust for $250,000 after alleged improprieties including lavish expense account spending.""[11]
 On December 4, 2006, the trust announced the hiring of art historian James N. Wood, the former Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, as the trust's new president and CEO, replacing Barry Munitz, who was forced to step down earlier in the year.[12][13] In 2009, after a substantial drop in the trust's assets, Wood cut nearly 100 employees at the trust's various operations, most at the Getty Museum. Fees for parking at the museum and the Getty Villa were raised by 50% to $15.[14] Wood died suddenly of natural causes on June 12, 2010.[15]  In May 2011 James Cuno, director of the Art Institute of Chicago, was named president and chief executive of the Getty Trust, to take office in August.[16]
 The J. Paul Getty Museum is an art museum.[17] It has two locations, one at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, California, and one at the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California.[17] The museum at the Getty Center contains ""Western art from the Middle Ages to the present;"" its estimated 1.3 million visitors annually makes it one of the most visited museums in the United States.[18] The museum at the Getty Villa contains art from ""ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria"".[19] The museum started as J. Paul Getty's personal art collection.
 The Getty Foundation was originally called the ""Getty Grant Program,"" which began in 1984 under the direction of Deborah Marrow.[20] The J. Paul Getty Trust can spend up to 0.75% of its endowment on gifts and grants; by 1990 the Getty Grant Program (then based in Santa Monica) had made 530 grants totaling $20 million to ""art historians, conservators and art museums in 18 countries"".[20] For example, a foundation grant funded the restoration of the Cosmati Pavement in the floor of Westminster Abbey.[21] For many years, the foundation conducted the Getty Leadership Institute (GLI).  The major GLI program is the Museum Leadership Institute (MLI), formerly known as the Museum Management Institute, which ""has served close to 1,000 museum professionals from the United States and 30 countries worldwide"".[22] However, effective on January 2, 2010,[23] the GLI was transferred to the Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California and was renamed ""The Getty Leadership Institute at Claremont Graduate University"".[24]
 The Getty Research Institute (GRI), located at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, California, is ""dedicated to furthering knowledge and advancing understanding of the visual arts"".[25]  GRI maintains a research library, organizes exhibitions and other events, sponsors a residential scholars program, publishes books, and maintains electronic databases including a Semantic Web service.[25] The GRI was originally called the ""Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities"", and was conceived as early as 1983.[26] Among other holdings, GRI's research library contains about 900,000 volumes of books, periodicals, and auction catalogs; special collections; and two million photographs of art and architecture.[27] The library also includes the trust's ""Institutional Archives"" which document the activities of the trust's various programs.[28]
 The Getty Conservation Institute (GCI), located in Los Angeles, California, is headquartered at the Getty Center but also has facilities at the Getty Villa, and commenced operation in 1985.[29] The GCI is a private international research institution dedicated to advancing conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge. It ""serves the conservation community through scientific research, education and training, model field projects, and the dissemination of the results of both its own work and the work of others in the field"" and ""adheres to the principles that guide the work of the Getty Trust: service, philanthropy, teaching, and access"".[29] GCI has activities in both art conservation and architectural conservation.[30] GCI scientists study the deterioration of objects and buildings, and how to prevent or stop such deterioration.[31] GCI has also been involved with long-term education programs, such as establishing a master's degree program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles.[32][33]
 From 1983 to June 1999, the Trust ran the Getty Information Institute (GII) which sought to collect electronic information to serve cultural heritage institution and researchers. Together with the American Council of Learned Societies GII sought to build a broad coalition of non-profits to establish a National Initiative for a Networked Cultural Heritage. Upon the dissolution of the GII, its data bases were transferred to the Getty Research Institute.[34]
 The trust was established by a Trust Indenture dated December 2, 1953 that created a California charitable trust was ""the diffusion of artistic and general knowledge.""[35] The trust is governed by a 13-member board of trustees.[36] Trustees are elected to serve four-year terms, with a maximum limit of three terms.[36] The board is self-perpetuating with the board electing or re-electing the trustees.[37] The board holds an annual meeting in May or June of each year.[38] Although the board conducts most of its work through committees, a number of important decisions are reserved for the entire board including approval of any art acquisition costing more than $1 million.[39]
 On October 2, 2006, the California Attorney General issued a report following an investigation of the trust and its operations.[40] At the close of the investigation an independent monitor was hired to assure proper governance and expenditures of the trust. On May 7, 2008, the Attorney General closed the monitoring process.[41]
 The trust was hurt by the economic downturn following 2007 and has reduced its annual budget by 14%. In 2007, the trust had $6.4 billion in endowment, but this amount dropped to $4.5 billion in 2009.[42] In 2009, the trust had $300 million in expenses down from $349 million in 2008.[43] For example, GRI co-produced the Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals with the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library, but transferred that activity to Columbia University on July 1, 2009.[44]
 With the recovery of the post-recession economy, the trust rose to $6.9 billion by 2017.[2]
 The J. Paul Getty Medal was established in 2013 by the Trustees of the J. Paul Getty Trust to honor extraordinary contributions to the practice, understanding and support of the arts.[45]
 The first recipients of the Getty Medal, which was presented in December 2013, were Harold M. Williams and Nancy Englander, who were honored for their leadership in creating the Getty as it exists today.[46] In  November 2014, the Getty Medal was presented to Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, a volunteer cultural leader known for his dedication to the preservation and public interpretation of Waddesdon Manor.[47]
 In September 2015, the Getty Medal was awarded to architect Frank Gehry,[48] who has built an architectural career over five decades and produced public and private buildings in America, Europe, and Asia. His work has earned Mr. Gehry several of the most significant awards in the architectural field, including the Pritzker Architecture Prize.
 The 2016 Getty Medal was awarded to musician Yo-Yo Ma and, posthumously, to artist Ellsworth Kelly at a celebratory dinner in October. In addition to his accomplished career as a master cellist, Ma founded the Silk Road Ensemble and the nonprofit Silkroad to promote the creation of new music, cross-cultural partnerships, education programs, and cross-disciplinary collaborations to create meaningful change at the intersection of the arts, education, and business. Accomplished painter and sculptor Ellsworth Kelly has supported the conservation of historical and contemporary art at museums and heritage sites in the U.S. and around the world, as well as the preservation of natural environment, through the Ellsworth Kelly Foundation.
 Artist Anselm Kiefer and writer Mario Vargas Llosa were presented with the 2017 J. Paul Getty Medal at a dinner in New York City on November 13, 2017.[49]
 In September 2018, the Getty Medal was awarded to Thelma Golden, director and chief curator of The Studio Museum in Harlem, Agnes Gund, president emerita of the Museum of Modern Art, and Richard Sierra, minimalist sculptor.[50]
 The 2019 J. Paul Getty Medal will be awarded to classicist Mary Beard and artists Ed Ruscha and Lorna Simpson.[51]"
Jain Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain_Foundation	"Ajit Jain (born 1951 in Orissa, India) is Vice Chairman of Insurance Operations for Berkshire Hathaway as of January 10, 2018.[1][2] He was raised in India's coastal state of Orissa. Ajit Jain is an older cousin of Anshu Jain, who was the former Co-CEO of Deutsche Bank.
 In 1972, Jain graduated from the IIT Kharagpur in India with a BTech degree in Mechanical Engineering.[3][4]
 From 1973 to 1976, Jain worked for IBM as a salesman for their data-processing operations in India. He was named ""Rookie of the Year"" in his region in 1973.[5] He lost his job in 1976 when IBM discontinued their operation in India because they declined to allow any Indian ownership of the company, as was then required by law.[5]
 In 1978, Jain moved to the United States, where he earned an MBA from Harvard University and joined McKinsey & Co. He returned to India in the early 1980s and married. The Jains then moved back to the United States, as Jain's wife preferred to live there.[6]
 In 1986, he left McKinsey to work on insurance operations for Warren Buffett. Jain was invited by his former boss, Michael Goldberg, who had left McKinsey & Co. to join Berkshire Hathaway in 1982.[5] At the time, he said he knew little about the insurance business.[7]
 In the annual letter to shareholders on 2014, it was suggested that both Jain and Greg Abel could be appropriate successors for Warren Buffett as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.[8][9] In January 2018, Jain was named Berkshire Hathaway's vice chair of insurance operations and appointed to Hathaway's Board of Directors.[10]
 Jain lives in the New York City area.[11]
 In 2005, Jain established the Jain Foundation, a non-profit organization located in Seattle, Washington, the mission of which is to cure limb-girdle muscular dystrophies caused by dysferlin protein deficiency, a condition that Jain's son has.[12][13]  Plavi Jain Mittal, who earned her PhD in  molecular biology from Brandeis University,[14] was the initial President and CEO.[12][14] In May 2017, Mittal formed In-Depth Genomics, an organization providing free whole-genome sequencing and analysis to people with rare diseases.[15]"

Jesse's Journey	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse%27s_Journey	"Jesse's Journey (French: le Reve de Jesse) is a Canadian charity focused on funding research into Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Founded in 1994 and named for Jesse Davidson, Jesse's Journey is based out of London, Ontario with a satellite office in Montreal, Quebec. Jesse's Journey is the only Canadian charity that solely exists to fund research into Duchenne.
 Jesse Davidson was six years old when he was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 
In 1994, The Davidsons created The Foundation for Gene and Cell Therapy (known as Jesse's Journey). On May 20, 1995, Jesse's Journey began its first steps at the Manitoba/Ontario border. Jesse's father, John Davidson, walked 3,300 kilometres to Ottawa, pushing Jesse in his wheelchair. This first journey raised $1.5M for research. Davidson is the holder of the Guinness World Record for the fastest crossing of Canada on foot.[1]
 On April 10, 1998 – Jesse's 18th birthday – Jesse's Journey: A Father's Tribute began. John Davidson's goal was to cross Canada on foot, raising funds and awareness across the country. Davidson succeeded in walking the 8,300 kilometres across Canada and raised $2M for research. This allowed The Foundation for Gene and Cell Therapy to create the Jesse Davidson Endowment – a fund that in 2015 stands at $11M and is a vehicle through which Jesse’s Journey can fund research in perpetuity, until a cure is found.
 In 1998 Davidson and his mother Sherene along with Journey volunteer Mario Chioini flew to Paris, France to assist the French Association le Dystrophe Musculaire with their 30-hour telethon. The telethon generated $116,000,000.[citation needed]
 On November 6, 2009, at the age of 29, Davidson lost his battle[2] with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
 On Christmas Eve 2009, one month after his son Jesse died, Davidson carried the Olympic Torch as London's final torch-bearer in the 2010 Olympic Torch Relay,[3] in honour of his son who had been named London's official torch-bearer earlier in the year.
 Jesse's Journey is the only Canadian charity that solely exists to fund research into treatments and a cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Through a rigorous annual granting process, Jesse's Journey seeks to fund the most promising research from around the world. Proposals are peer-reviewed by external reviewers.
 In 2015, the 20th anniversary of John and Jesse's journey across Ontario, Jesse's Journey reached a milestone by for the first time granting more than $1M in a single year.[4]"
Jesuit Refugee Service	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_Refugee_Service	"The Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) is an international Catholic organisation with a mission to accompany, serve, and advocate on behalf of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons, that they may heal, learn, and determine their own future. Founded in November 1980 as a work of the Society of Jesus, JRS was officially registered on 19 March 2000 in Vatican City as a foundation. The impetus to found JRS came from the then superior general of the Jesuits, Pedro Arrupe, who was inspired to action by the plight of Vietnamese boat people.[1] JRS has programmes in over 50 countries. The areas of work are in the field of education, emergency assistance, health care, livelihoods, reconciliation, and psychosocial support. JRS is also involved in advocacy and human rights work. This involves ensuring that refugees are afforded their full rights as guaranteed by the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees[2] and working to strengthen the protection afforded to Internally displaced persons (IDPs).[3]
JRS's international headquarters is located in Rome at the Society's General Curia. The International Director is Rev. Thomas H. Smolich SJ.
 
 JRS was founded in November 1980 by Fr. Pedro Arrupe SJ, the then superior general of the Society of Jesus, to respond to the plight of Vietnamese boat people fleeing their war-ravaged homeland.
 Following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese fled their homes, setting out in overcrowded boats across the South China Sea. Many did not survive the journey; they were killed by pirates, or drowned because of storms and rough seas. Fr Arrupe felt compelled to act. He called on the Jesuits “to bring at least some relief to such a tragic situation.”
 Fr Arrupe wrote to over 50 Jesuit provinces regarding the situation, recognising that the Jesuits, then numbering 27,000 men across the world, were well-placed to coordinate a global humanitarian response. As conflicts broke out in Central and Latin America, southeastern Europe, and across Africa, JRS rapidly grew from helping Vietnamese boat people in a few camps in Southeast Asia to working with refugees around the world.
 Nearly 20 years after its founding, JRS was officially registered as a foundation of the Vatican City State on March 19, 2000.
 JRS's mission is to accompany, serve, and advocate on behalf of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons, that they may heal, learn, and determine their own future. 
 As an international humanitarian NGO, JRS strives to implement the magis ideal of Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits. One of the key messages of the 35th Jesuit General Congregation (2008) was to reach new physical, cultural, religious and social frontiers, to those who are estranged,[4] a task confirmed by two Popes.[5] The search for new frontiers has taken JRS to places where refugees face deprivation and abuse of their basic rights: traditional refugee camps, detention centres and prisons, conflict zones, border areas, and in the heart of big cities, including Iraq and Syria.[2][6]
 On May 24, 2019, Jesuit Superior General Arturo Sosa called all Jesuits to ""renewed commitment"" to JRS in accord with the Jesuits' newly promulgated apostolic preferences, endorsed by Pope Francis. For its part JRS is restructuring to produce ""strong country offices that will strengthen local capacity and encourage subsidiarity."" JRS defined its priorities for 2019-2023 as, ""the promotion of reconciliation and social cohesion; the delivery of quality formal and informal education; innovative livelihood programmes that lead to self-reliance and sustainability; and effective advocacy for the rights of refugees.""[7]
 In deciding with whom to work, JRS finds the scope of existing international conventions is too restrictive.[8] It therefore applies the expression 'de facto refugee' to all ""persons persecuted because of race, religion, membership of social or political groups""; to ""the victims of armed conflicts, erroneous economic policy or natural disasters""; and, for ""humanitarian reasons"", to internally displaced persons, that is, civilians who ""are forcibly uprooted from their homes by the same type of violence as refugees but who do not cross national frontiers.""[9]
 Since the above definition refers only to individuals in fear of persecution, regional organisations in both Africa (African Union 1969) and Latin America (Organisation for American States 1984) have developed wider definitions which include mass displacements which occur as a result of social and economic collapse in the context of conflict. JRS strives by ""accompaniment"" to respect the human dignity of all refugees throughout their ordeal.[10]
 On the website of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, detailed recent reports are given of JRS work under the following categories: Country Reports, Fact Finding Reports, Handbooks/Manuals, Legal Articles/Analyses/Commentaries, Policy/Position Papers, Regional Reports, and Thematic Reports.[2]

Jewish Community Center	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Community_Center	"A Jewish Community Center or Jewish Community Centre (JCC) is a general recreational, social, and fraternal organization serving the Jewish community in a number of cities. JCCs promote Jewish culture and heritage through holiday celebrations, Israel-related programming, and Jewish education. However, they are open to everyone in the community.
 The JCC Association is the continental umbrella organization for the Jewish Community Center movement, which includes more than 350 JCCs, YM–YWHAs, and camp sites in the U.S. and Canada, in addition to 180 local JCCs in the Former Soviet Union, 70 in Latin America, 50 in Europe, and close to 500 smaller centres in Israel.
 The Hebrew Young Men's Literary Association was first set up in 1854 in a building at the corner of Fayette and Gay streets in Baltimore, Maryland[5] to provide support for Jewish immigrants.[1][6] Dr. Aaron Friedenwald was the group's founder and first president.[1]
 The first Young Men's Hebrew Association (YMHA) was founded in New York City on October 10, 1874, with Lewis May as its first president.[7] The first official headquarters were at 112 West 21st Street in Manhattan.[7] Young Women's Hebrew Association (YWHA) was first established as an annex to the YMHA in 1888.[8] YWHA was founded to provide spiritual and material support for the young Jewish women who were moving to cities at the time.[9] YMHA helped young Jewish women find housing and employment.[9] Fannie Liebovitz was one of the founders.[10] The first independent YWHA was established in 1902.[8] The New York YMHA and YWHA now operate together as the 92nd Street Y. (There are two other YM–YWHA organizations in Manhattan, which are not affiliated with the 92nd Street Y. They are the 14th Street Y, and the YM & YWHA of Washington Heights and Inwood. The 14th Street Y, in the Gramercy/East Village neighborhood, is a branch of the Educational Alliance. The Washington Heights organization serves a diverse community uptown.) In 1917, these organizations were combined into a Jewish Welfare Board.
 Following a merger of the Young Men's Hebrew Association, Young Women's Hebrew Association, and the Jewish Education Alliance, the organization was renamed Jewish Community Center (JCC) in 1951.[1] Many member organizations adopted the new name, but some other member organizations did not do so, particularly in the New York metropolitan area, such as:
 An example of the objectives of Jewish Community Centers can be seen within the New Bedford, Massachusetts branch's Constitution. In January 1947, the Jewish Community Center of New Bedford listed the following objectives:
 JCC Association offers a wide range of services and resources to help its affiliates to provide educational, cultural, social, Jewish identity-building, and recreational programs for people of all ages and backgrounds. JCC Association[18] supports the largest network of Jewish early childhood centers and Jewish summer camps in North America, and is also a U.S. government accredited agency for serving the religious and social needs of Jewish military personnel through JWB Jewish Chaplains Council.[19]
 Some JCCs provide services for people with special needs, such as autism spectrum disorders and learning disabilities.  In 2008, The Mandel JCC of Cleveland[20] was awarded $652,500 in grant funding to be used for individuals with disabilities.  Cleveland-area children and adults with emotional, physical and developmental disabilities now have many opportunities to get involved in fitness, wellness and recreational activities. Whenever possible, activities are inclusive and children are able to fully participate, usually with the assistance of an aide.
 As a rule, today JCCs are open to other ethnic groups as well, with a possible exception of strictly traditional Jewish activities. In fact, many JCCs sponsor local events. There are, however, many other activities that anyone can host at the JCC.
 There are almost two dozen Jewish community centers in the New York metro area, providing a wide range of social, cultural, and educational services, ranging from lectures, concerts, theater performances, and dance recitals to health and fitness classes, job training workshops, and citizenship classes. Although the majority of JCCs are found on the East Coast, with 17 sites in Florida, JCCs operate in many other communities. For example, California has 17 locations—eight in the San Francisco Bay Area and nine scattered through Southern California—and the Chicago metropolitan area has 10. Almost all of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. now have at least one JCC, and a handful of smaller communities also have locations. JCCs all over the country sponsor film festivals and book fairs, bringing world-renowned writers and directors to smaller communities.
 Their programs and activities vary by location. Particularly noteworthy is the  JCC in West Bloomfield, Michigan,[21] which is the largest JCC in North America, and possibly the world. The Holocaust Memorial Center, which attracts many visitors to its programs and exhibits, used to be a part of the JCC of West Bloomfield, but recently opened a building of its own.  The West Bloomfield JCC houses two gymnasiums which can be made into three gyms using a movable wall, a workout area, an indoor full size and kiddie pool, an outdoor full size pool, a kosher restaurant, a Michigan Jewish war veterans museum, an in line hockey center, a library, ceramics/art rooms, a large multi-purpose room (Handleman Hall), an art museum, an area dedicated to teaching and learning about tzedakah (charity) called Shalom Street, a performing arts theater in the basement, a preschool, offices for summer camps, the previously mentioned preschool, and other administrative offices and organizations.  The top floor is completely dedicated to The Jean and Samuel Frankel Jewish Academy of Metropolitan Detroit,[22] a Jewish High School which opened in 2000.  The JCC building is on the Eugene and Marcia Applebaum Jewish Community Campus along with multiple living quarters for the elderly and mentally disabled and an Alzheimer's treatment building.
 One recent addition to the family of JCC's in North America is The JCC in Manhattan.[23] This eleven story building situated in Manhattan's Upper West Side neighborhood opened its doors in the winter of 2002. The JCC offers a diversity of programs, from parenting to fitness, and each year the organization produces Israel NonStop, a week-long festival presenting the most interesting and innovative Israeli musicians, authors, theatrical groups and films.
 In 2011, the Joan and Alan Bernikow JCC of Staten Island installed solar panels as part of a solar thermal system.[24] The solar panels are expected to reduce 27,500 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions, the equivalent of planting two acres of Douglas fir trees every year. Its two dozen 10-foot solar panels will keep the building’s hot water at a constant temperature of 180 degrees. Up next is the installation of a photo voltaic system, which will use solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity. This is part of JCC’s vision of environmental sustainability, which benefits the community both ethically and economically.
 The Robert & Dorothy Ludwig Schenectady JCC became well known for their ""million likes"" photo that went viral in less than 48 hours.  The photo showed three of its camp staff holding a sign that said ""Our boss said that if this picture gets 1,000,000 likes that our summer camp can get an outdoor movie screen.""  In less than a week the picture received over 300,000 likes and it was one of the most successful uses of social media ever by a JCC.
 In recent decades, several incidents that have taken place at JCCs and other Jewish-related locations across the United States and Canada, as well as the September 11 attacks, have prompted JCCs in all areas to increase security at their facilities. Some of these events have included:
 New security measures now being implemented include the mandatory display of photo ID (for non-members) upon entry to the building, background checks of prospective employees and members, and police officers or security guards being stationed on premises. Childcare areas now have their access restricted to those who have legitimate reason to enter, and removal of a child, which is tightly monitored, is permitted only by custodial parents and guardians and other authorized adults. In addition, many other new security features now reduce the likelihood of non-members gaining access to member-restricted areas.Template:Needs-citation"
John A. Hartford Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Hartford_Foundation	"Margaret L. Wolff, Chairman, Board of Trustees

 The John A. Hartford Foundation (JAHF), based in New York City, is a private, nonpartisan, national philanthropy dedicated to improving the care of older adults. For more than three decades, the organization has been the leader in building a field of experts in aging and testing and replicating innovative approaches to care. The Foundation has three priority areas: creating age-friendly health systems, supporting family caregivers, and improving serious illness and end-of-life care. Working with its grantees, the Foundation strives to change the status quo and create a society where older adults can continue their vital contributions. 
 The Foundation's vision is a nation where all older adults receive high-value evidence-based health care, are treated with respect and dignity, and have their goals and preferences honored.
 The Foundation was founded in 1929 by John Augustine Hartford and later joined by his brother George Ludlum Hartford, both former chief executives of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (the A&P grocery stores). The foundation's mission from the beginning has been ""to do the greatest good for the greatest number.""
 The Foundation's grants in the mid-20th century were predominantly for basic and clinical medical research; it was at one time the largest funder in this area. In the 1970s, the foundation  moved towards a wider range of   projects ""that will have high impact.""[2]
 In 1982 the Foundation launched its Aging and health program and by 1994, that program became the foundation's sole focus. Foundation grants made between 1982 and 2012 supported programs to increase the nation's capacity and ability to serve older adults by funding select academic medical centers and other health settings to strengthen the geriatrics training of America's physicians, nurses and social workers. The Foundation also supported a number of efforts to improve and integrate the system of health care services needed by elders, with an emphasis on creating nationally replicable models of care.
 As of today, the Foundation focuses on three priority areas, Age-Friendly Health Systems, Family Caregiving and Serious Illness & End of Life. The Foundation invests in aging experts and practice innovations that transform how the care of older adults is delivered.
 JAHF Grants focus on work that creates age-friendly health systems, supports family caregivers, and improves serious illness and end-of-life care; it periodically makes grants in other areas of special interest that improve the care of older adults but fall outside those three priority areas.
 Age-Friendly Health Systems look to develop large-scale approaches that help health systems transform care; operationalize the essential elements of good care, building on the Foundation’s investments in evidence-based models and best practices; and better integrate community-based supports and services within the health system and across the continuum of care.
 Family Caregiving strives to improve the ability of health systems and providers to identify, assess, and support family caregivers; raise awareness among policymakers, health system leaders, funders, and the public to drive change; and create large-scale change in partnership with national efforts.
 Serious Illness & End of Life grants aim to increase access to high-quality palliative care services and other evidence-based models and practices; develop approaches for better educating and preparing the health care workforce, and foster communication and community-based solutions while informing public policy supportive of the needs of the seriously ill and their families.
 In 2017, the Age-Friendly Health Systems initiative was launched in partnership with the institute for Healthcare Improvement, the American Hospital Association, and the Catholic Health Association to develop and test an innovative, tailored model of care for older patients in five health systems covering 40 states. The goal: bringing age-friendly health care to 20 percent of U.S. hospitals and health systems by 2020."
John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._and_Catherine_T._MacArthur_Foundation	"The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation is a private foundation that makes grants and impact investments to support non-profit organizations in approximately 50 countries around the world. It has an endowment of $7.0 billion and provides approximately $260 million annually in grants and impact investments.[3][4] It is based in Chicago and is the 12th-largest private foundation in the United States.[5] It has awarded more than US$6.8 billion since its first grants in 1978.[1]
 The Foundation's stated aim is to support ""creative people, effective institutions, and influential networks building a more just, verdant, and peaceful world.""[3][6] MacArthur's current grant-making priorities include mitigating climate change, reducing jail populations, decreasing nuclear threats, supporting nonprofit journalism, and funding local priorities in its hometown of Chicago.[7] The MacArthur Fellows Program, also referred to as ""genius grants"", awards $625,000 no-strings-attached grants annually to about two dozen creative individuals in diverse fields.[8] The Foundation's 100&Change competition awards a $100 million grant every three years to a single proposal.
 John D. MacArthur owned Bankers Life and Casualty and other businesses, as well as considerable property holdings in Florida and New York. His wife, Catherine, held positions in many of these companies. Their attorney, William T. Kirby, and Paul Doolen, their CFO, suggested that the family create a foundation to be endowed by their vast fortune. One of the reasons MacArthur originally set up the Foundation was to avoid taxes.[9][10]
 When MacArthur died on January 6, 1978, he was worth in excess of a billion dollars. He left ninety-two percent of his estate to found the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The composition of the Foundation’s first board of directors, per MacArthur’s will, also included J. Roderick MacArthur, John's son from his first marriage, two other officers of Bankers Life and Casualty, and radio commentator Paul Harvey.[1] Jonas Salk, the inventor of the polio vaccine, later joined the Foundation's board of directors.[11]
 MacArthur believed in the free market.[12][13] However, MacArthur did not spell out specific parameters for how his money was to be spent after he died. MacArthur told the Foundation's board of directors, ""I figured out how to make the money. You fellows will have to figure out how to spend it.""[14]
 Between 1979 and 1981, John's son J. Roderick MacArthur, an ideological opponent of his father with whom the elder MacArthur had an acrimonious relationship, waged a legal battle against the Foundation for control of the board of directors.[9] The younger MacArthur sued eight members of the board, accusing them of mismanagement of the Foundation's finances.[15][16]
 By 1981, most of the original board had been replaced by members who agreed with J. Roderick MacArthur's desire to support liberal causes.[17] This ultimately resulted in the creation of what, in 2008, historian[18][19] and conservative commentator[20] Martin Morse Wooster called ""one of the pillars of the liberal philanthropic establishment.""[21] In 1984, MacArthur again sued the board of directors, asking a Cook County circuit court to liquidate the entire MacArthur Foundation. He dropped the suit later that same year when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.[22][23]
 John E. Corbally, the first president of the Foundation and later board chairman from 1995 to 2002, was followed in 1989–99 by Adele Simmons, who was the first female dean at Princeton University.[24][25] Jonathan Fanton, president of American Academy of Arts and Sciences, served as the Foundation's next president.[24][26] Robert Gallucci, formerly dean of Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, served as the Foundation's fourth president from 2009 to 2014.[24][27] Gallucci was fired in 2014, with the Foundation's board announcing it was ""looking for a new kind of leadership.""[28] Julia Stasch, who formerly served as MacArthur's vice president for U.S. Programs, was named the Foundation's president in 2015.[1] Stasch had formerly served as chief of staff to Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley.[29] She announced that she would step down in 2019.[30] In March, 2019, John Palfrey was named the next president of the foundation, effective September 1, 2019.[31]
 The MacArthur Fellowship is an award issued by the MacArthur Foundation each year, to typically 20 to 30 citizens or residents of the United States, of any age and working in any field, who ""show exceptional merit and promise for continued and enhanced creative work."" The program was initiated in 1981.[32]  According to the Foundation, the fellowship is not a reward for past accomplishment, but an investment in a person's originality and potential. MacArthur Fellows receive $625,000 each, which is paid out in quarterly installments over five years.[33] The Chicago Foundation for Women was one of the nonprofit organizations to receive a US$1million four year grant in 2017.[34] No one can apply for the program, and, generally, no one knows if he or she is being considered as a candidate. Nominators, serving confidentially, anonymously and for a limited time, are invited to recommend potential Fellows. Candidates are reviewed by a Selection Committee, whose members also serve confidentially, anonymously and for a limited time.  Ultimately, the Committee makes recommendations to the Foundation's Board of Directors for final approval.[8]
 In June 2016, the foundation put out a call for ""proposals promising real progress toward solving a critical problem of our time in any field or any location."" The winning proposal would receive a $100 million grant. Almost 2,000 proposals were submitted. In December 2017, the foundation announced that the winning proposal was submitted by the Sesame Workshop and the International Rescue Committee. The grant was put toward educating Middle Eastern refugee children.[35]"
Just a Drop	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_a_Drop	"Just a Drop - a charitable organization helping to provide clean water and sanitation in poor countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Founded in 1998 by a managing director of World Travel Market Fiona Jeffery and supported  by the members of the international travel industry. Based in the United Kingdom.
 The institution raises money to build wells, install hand pumps and implement health and sanitation programmes. By its information, just over £10 can supply a person in a developing country with safe water for life, £10 provides water to a child for ten years, improved water quality reduces child diarrhoea by 15-20%, hand washing and safe food handling reduces child diarrhoea by 35%, safe disposal of children's faeces reduces diarrhoea by nearly 40%.
 Since the establishment the organization raised more than £750,000 and helped over 800,000 people in 24 countries.
 Every year in November the travel and tourism industry companies promote fundraising for Just a Drop at World Travel Market.
 In 2002 Just a Drop was named the official charity of the International Institute for Peace through Tourism (IIPT).[1]"
Kin Canada	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_Canada	"Kin Canada (formerly the Kinsmen and Kinette Clubs of Canada) is a secular Canadian non-profit service organization that promotes service, fellowship, positive values, and national pride.
 Kin Canada is an organization whose members comprise Kinsmen, Kinette and Kin Clubs (service clubs) located in Canada. Membership is open to all persons regardless of race, colour, or creed.
 Around 7,000 members belong to about 500 Kinsmen, Kinette and Kin clubs from coast to coast. Kinsmen clubs are predominantly male-only while Kinette clubs are predominantly female-only. Kin clubs have a mixed membership of men and women. The Association was founded in Canada and there are no clubs outside of Canada.
 In 1920, Harold A. Rogers, known in Kin Canada circles as ""Founder Hal"", founded the first Kinsmen club in Hamilton, Ontario. Rogers, a 21-year-old, had just returned from World War I and his father, a well-known Rotarian, encouraged him to join the Rotary Club. Rogers was rejected because the Rotary Club would not allow two members from the same business establishment. Not a person to be outdone, Rogers decided to create a new club. As a result of his initiative, a small group of like-minded men gathered for a dinner meeting on February 20, 1920 and formed what became known as the Kinsmen Club of Hamilton – Canada's first Kinsmen Club.
 Prominent former and current Kin members include:
 Each club raises funds and determines how to spend those funds in its community. Together, the clubs raised CAD $18.32 million in the 2010-2011 Kin year.
 The Kinsmen Field House, a sports venue in Edmonton, was created with Kin funding.
 Since 1964, Kin Canada has supported Cystic Fibrosis Canada, raising as much as CAD $1 million a year for cystic fibrosis (CF) research and treatment. To date, Kin have raised more than $39 million for CF. This makes Kin the country's largest single fundraiser for cystic fibrosis.
 Kin Canada Bursaries, a program of the Hal Rogers Endowment Fund, provides financial assistance to eligible persons in their quest for higher learning. Kin Canada established the Hal Rogers Endowment Fund upon the passing of founder Hal Rogers.
 The Kin Canada Foundation is an incorporated and federally chartered charitable organization established in 2005 to help Kin Canada achieve the objective of ""Serving the Community’s Greatest Need"". The Foundation's primary goal is to work hand-in-hand with Kin Canada to help resource and develop many of the programs provided for the benefit of the members across Canada.
 The Kin Organ Donor Awareness Campaign (Kin-ODAC) was established in 2001 at National Convention to improve awareness and education about the importance of organ donation across Canada.
 Telemiracle is a telethon organized by the Kinsmen and Kinettes in Saskatchewan, Canada for the benefit of the Kinsmen Foundation, a Kin Canada affiliate in Saskatchewan. Initially broadcast on both CTV and CBC affiliates in Saskatchewan, it is now broadcast, commercial-free, exclusively on the province's CTV stations.
 The first telethon, in 1977, raised more than CAD $1 million, which at the time was considered a record for per capita telethon fund-raising in a 20-hour period (the province had a population of only about 1 million people at the time). The telethon passed the $2 million mark for the first time in 1983. And in recent years, the telethon has routinely raised between $3.0 and $5.0 million each year."
Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knut_and_Alice_Wallenberg_Foundation	"The Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation is a private foundation (Swedish: Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse), founded in 1917 by a donation of SEK 20 million by the chairman of the Stockholms Enskilda Bank, Knut Agathon Wallenberg and his wife Alice.
 The foundation is the largest of the Wallenberg foundations, and one of the largest Swedish funders of research. Since its founding the Foundation has disbursed approximately 16 Billion Kronor.[2]"
Konrad Adenauer Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Adenauer_Foundation	"The Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e.V. (KAS; Konrad Adenauer Foundation) is a German political party foundation associated with but independent of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The foundation's headquarters are located in Sankt Augustin near Bonn.[1] Globally, the KAS has 78 offices and runs programs in over 100 countries.[2] Its current chairman is the former President of the German parliament Deutscher Bundestag, Norbert Lammert. It is a member of the Centre for European Studies, the official foundation and think tank of the European People's Party (EPP).[3]
 The establishment of a “systematic civic-education program inspired by Christian democratic values” began being considered in 1952 by a group of CDU politicians including Bundestag president Hermann Ehlers, Robert Tillmanns, and Heinrich Krone. On 20 December 1955 The Society for Christian Democratic Education Work, which would be renamed after Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in 1964, was opened in Bonn.[4]
 The aim of the foundation's civic education programs is, according to their official website,[5] the “promotion of freedom and liberty, peace, and justice” through “furthering European unification, improving transatlantic relations, and deepening development cooperation”.[6][7] Their function as a think-tank and consulting agency[8] is intended to provide citizens with a basis for political action through the research and analyses of current political trends.[9][10] The KAS offers more than 2,500 conferences and events each year worldwide, and actively supports the political involvement and education of intellectually gifted youth through a prestigious scholarship program as well as an ongoing comprehensive seminar program.[11][12]
 Along with the headquarters in Sankt Augustin and Berlin, the KAS operates two educational centers, sixteen training centers, an Academy,[13] and an international conference center.
 The KAS consists of six departments: 
 Former President of the Bundestag Norbert Lammert is the current President of the KAS. He is joined on the Board of Directors[23] by 24 other individuals. The KAS currently has 55 members, many of whom are current and former CDU politicians. The Board of Trustees[24] has 24 members who assist and supervise the work of the KAS.
 Similar to other German political foundations, the Konrad Adenauer Foundation is largely financed by federal and land government funds. 96.8% of the foundation's €120 million budget in 2009 was therefore provided by public funding, while 2.7% was derived from admission charges and miscellaneous revenues, and 0.5% came from private funds and donations.[25][26]
 The Konrad Adenauer Foundation awards a prize for young scholars, named after the CDU politician Bruno Heck, a prize for local journalists and a literature prize.
 In Bavaria, the Hanns Seidel Foundation operates in lieu of the Konrad-Adenauer Foundation; in Schleswig-Holstein, the Hermann-Ehlers-Foundation assumes the Adenauer Foundation's role. These two CDU-friendly foundations are not the Adenauer Foundation's only collaborators; for instance, the Adenauer Foundation co-published a study with the Bertelsmann Foundation, the Market Economy Foundation, and the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation titled ""Educational Policy in a Federal System and International Influences"", in which it injected itself into the dialogue on educational policy and examined various influences. Furthermore, the Adenauer Foundation authored a ""Common Declaration"" in partnership with the Friedrich-Ebert-Foundation, the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation, the Hans-Seidel-Foundation, and the Heinrich-Boell-Foundation which explored various mission statements and financing models of political foundations in Germany. The KAS is a member of ""European Movement Germany"". As a member of the market-oriented Stockholm Network, the KAS cooperates with other foundations and think tanks in issues pertaining to European politics.
 Former scholars of the foundation have been Thomas de Maizière, Peter Altmaier, Christian Wulff, Uwe Barschel, Tom Enders, Stefan Hell,
Armin Laschet, Friedrich Merz, Detlef Seif, and Ruprecht Polenz.[citation needed]
 The other parties in Germany also use the legal form of a foundation for support and public relations purposes. The other foundations are:"
The Kresge Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kresge_Foundation	"The Kresge Foundation is a U.S. philanthropic private foundation headquartered in Troy, Michigan.[1] The foundation works to expand opportunities in America’s cities through grantmaking and investing in arts and culture, education, environment, health, human services and community development efforts.[2]
 In 2013, the foundation's Board of Trustees approved 316 awards totaling $122 million; $128 million was paid out to grantees over the course of the year. Kresge's Social Investment Practice made another $17.7 million available to organizations whose efforts
support foundation goals through program-related investments.[3]
 Kresge has practiced strategic philanthropy since completing a historic transition that began in 2007. Long known for its exclusive use of the challenge grant to help local communities raise funds for major construction and renovation projects, it now employs an array of funding methods to address and advance a set of narrowly defined programmatic objectives. It awards grants and makes program-related investments. Some grants are awarded for a single year; others are for multiple years. Some of its programs accept applications on an ongoing basis. Others proactively invite or solicit applications.
 In January 2013, the foundation pledged $150 million to aid in the implementation of a long-ranging, comprehensive framework for Detroit's future, also known as The Detroit Future City plan.[4]
 Since July 1, 2006, the foundation has been led by Rip Rapson, formerly of the McKnight Foundation. He succeeded John Marshall III as president and CEO.
 In 1924, with an initial gift of $1.6 million, Sebastian Kresge established The Kresge Foundation in Detroit. Twelve years earlier, he and partner John G. McCrory opened the first 5-and-10-cent store, and parlayed the concept and operations into a chain of stores that were incorporated as the S.S. Kresge Company. Many years later the enterprise became known as Kmart. The foundation and the stores are not affiliated.

La Caixa	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Caixa	"La Caixa (Catalan pronunciation: [lə ˈkaʃə]), formally Caixa d'Estalvis i Pensions de Barcelona (Spanish: Caja de Ahorros y Pensiones de Barcelona), headquartered in Valencia, is currently Spain's third largest financial institution, with a network of over 5,800 branches, more than 9,500 automated teller machines, a workforce in excess of 31,900 and more than 13 million customers.[1]
 Today's La Caixa is the result of the July 27, 1990 merger between the Caja de Pensiones para la Vejez y de Ahorros de Cataluña y Baleares, founded in 1904, and the Caja de Ahorros y Monte de Piedad de Barcelona, founded in 1844. From the beginning, La Caixa focused on savings for families and offering its customers security in their old age, when this type of social provision did not yet exist in Spain. Owing to its origins, it is a financial institution, albeit not for profit and charitable and social in nature, with a private board of trustees, independent of any other company or institution.[1]
 Similarly, the Group has a portfolio of industrial interests in companies mainly in the infrastructure, energy and communications sectors.[1] In November 2006, the La Caixa Board of Directors approved the company portfolio of holdings' listing on the stock market, through the Criteria CaixaCorp company, which came into effect on October 10, 2007.[2]
 In January 29, 2008, Criteria CaixaCorp was added to the IBEX 35 stock market index.[3]
 On October 6, 2017, the bank announced its decision to move its legal headquarters to Valencia as a response to political uncertainty in Catalonia.[4]
 On January 27, 2011, the Board of Directors of La Caixa announced the reorganisation of the Group, by virtue of which La Caixa transfers its banking business to Criteria CaixaCorp, which becomes a banking group called CaixaBank, and Criteria CaixaCorp transfers part of its industrial participations to a new unquoted entity that depends on La Caixa.
 On June 30, 2011, all the banking business of La Caixa, including consumer banking, private banking and asset management, was transferred to CaixaBank. All the branch offices now use CaixaBank name while keeping the logo of La Caixa.
 CaixaBank brings together the banking business of La Caixa, the insurance business and the participations in international banks and in Telefónica and Repsol. The bank is founded with a leadership position in the Spanish financial and insurance sector, and additionally diversified in with other complementary activities. It also has some 5,200 branches, the lowest ratio of arrears among the large Spanish financial groups[citation needed], the best coverage and the best position of capital[citation needed].
 In the late 1970s, La Caixa asked Landor & Associates to create a corporate identity that would be easily identifiable and that customers could make their own. From the proposals submitted, it was decided to commission the Catalan artist Joan Miró to create a tapestry, from which an emblematic element could be isolated. In 1980, a logo was chosen: a blue star and two coloured circles (a child depositing a coin in a piggy-bank), which has become the renowned symbol of the institution.[5] The original tapestry is on display in the foyer of the La Caixa headquarters in Barcelona.
 Due to its nonprofit status, the bank controls the largest charitable foundation in Spain, and one of the largest in the world. As of 2015, Obra Social La Caixa is the world’s third largest charity, disbursing around €500 million a year, of which a fifth goes to culture and science.[6] It makes major[citation needed] investments in such public welfare causes as care of the aged and infants, curing Alzheimer's, technologically advanced classrooms, old-age centers and the like.
 Through its Social Programme, La Caixa funds social, environmental and scientific, cultural and research programmes[citation needed]. La Caixa Foundation is Spain’s leading private foundation, the second in Europe and the fifth in the world in terms of budgetary volume (550 million Euro for 2008), according to data from the European Foundation.[7]
 In 2007, the La Caixa Social Programme undertook specific programmes to combat poverty and social exclusion (the CaixaProinfancia programme and the Incorpora employment integration programme) [8] and the creation of MicroBank, a social bank whose primary activity is to award social and financial micro-credits to people who are at risk from social or financial exclusion and to groups with limited resources.[9] It also promotes access to rental apartments to sectors of the population who have difficulty in accessing the property market and care programmes focused on dependency, for individuals in advanced stages of illness, child vaccination and international cooperation.
 The La Caixa Social Programme also provides resources for education and research programmes, environmental protection and the dissemination of culture through its centres, such as the recently opened CaixaForum Madrid.
 In 2005, the bank received the Gold Medal of the Generalitat de Catalunya for these efforts.
 At the end of 2007, La Caixa had 5,480 branches, of which 5,468 are located throughout Spain and two operating abroad (Warsaw, Poland and Bucharest, Romania), and 10 representative offices in Germany, Belgium, China, France, Italy, Morocco, Portugal and the United Kingdom. La Caixa also has over 8,011 ATMs, through which more than 500 million transactions were made in 2007. All ATMs are fitted with keyboards adapted to the Braille system and allow the letter size used on the screens to be increased. Of these, 2,491 include a voice system for people with visual impairment.[10]
 La Caixa also has an online banking service (Línea Abierta) which offers more than 700 consultations and transactions (including account management, transfers, direct debits, arranging deposits, loans and mortgages, pension plans, investment funds) and now has over 2.5 million operating customers a month (September 2008), both private individuals and companies. La Caixa's online bank is the leading one of its kind in Europe according to the AQMetrix (Private Banking Division – autumn 2008)[citation needed]. The Línea Abierta Móvil service allows customers to consult statements and account and credit card movements, make transfers, consult listings, buy and sell securities and receive notifications via SMS.[11]
 In addition, ServiCaixa leads the Spanish market in sales of cinema, theatre, music and sports events tickets via e-channels (7.7 million advance sales in 2007).[12]
 On 17 December  2013, La Caixa announced the launch of an NFC-based mobile payments system through a partnership with Visa Europe, and the largest mobile network operators in the country – Vodafone, Telefónica and Orange. Eighty per cent of the Spanish market is held by these three giants. Isidre Fainé Casas is in venta minorista of the Bankia of Madrid."

The Lawrence Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lawrence_Foundation	"The Lawrence Foundation is a private family foundation in the United States focused on making grants to support environmental, education, human services and other causes.[2] It makes both program and operating grants and does not have any geographical restrictions. Nonprofit organizations that qualify for public charity status under section 501(c)(3) of the US Internal Revenue Code or other similar organizations are eligible for grants from The Lawrence Foundation.
 The Lawrence Foundation was established in 2000 by Jeff Lawrence and Diane Troth (husband and wife)[3] from the proceeds received from the acquisition of Trillium Digital Systems, Inc. by Intel Corporation.[4] Trillium Digital Systems, Inc. developed and licensed communications software and was founded in 1988 by Jeff Lawrence and Larisa Chistyakov. The founding trustees of the foundation were Jeff and Diane. Diane died in 2016. The current trustees are Jeff and his two children.
 Since its founding in 2000, the Foundation has received over 12,000 grant applications and made grants of over US$ 5 million.[5] In 2017, the Foundation received over 900 grant applications and approved 40 grants worth over US$ 200,000. The Foundation ended 2017 with US$ 4 million in assets. Statistics of all applications received and grants made in 2017 and earlier can be found here. To apply to The Lawrence Foundation, non-profits must use the Common Grant Application, an online grant application and management system. The Lawrence Foundation does not accept paper-based letter of inquiry and/or grant applications.
 In March 2005, The Lawrence Foundation, in conjunction with the Natural Resources Defense Council and Tufts University, organized and hosted a workshop of environmental economists from academia. The purpose of the workshop was to identify, develop and engage a network of economists and others that shared and supported a common vision of developing, delivering and advocating credible and effective economic theories and arguments for environmental protection, stewardship, and investment. In 2006, the economists who attended that meeting started Center for the Applied Study of Economics and Environment (CASE&E), with a year of preliminary programs – launching an online directory of economists open to working with the environmental movement, and offering summer internships with environmental groups, and dissertation support, for economics graduate students. The organization continues to grow and recently changed its name to Economics for Equity and the Environment Network (E3) to more accurately reflect its current focus.
 Lawrence is a common name and there is another Lawrence Foundation in Roslyn, NY, that has a different grantmaking focus and interests than The Lawrence Foundation in Santa Monica, CA."
LDS Humanitarian Services	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDS_Humanitarian_Services	"LDS Humanitarian Services is a branch of the Welfare Services department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The organization's stated mission is to relieve suffering, to foster self-reliance for people of all nationalities and religions, and to provide opportunities for service.[1]
 The LDS Church considers humanitarian work to be an essential part of its mission to bless all humanity in emulation of Jesus Christ ""who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed"" (Acts 10:38). Throughout its history, the LDS Church has always provided for those in need and is perhaps best known for its efforts to take care of its own. In 1842, Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, organized the Women's Relief Society, with a primary focus to provide ""relief"" to suffering members and ultimately to all people.  During the Great Depression the LDS Church organized a welfare program, now administered the church's Welfare Services department, to help provide for the needs of its members.
 As the program has grown, the church's welfare efforts have expanded to help people around the world regardless of religion, race, or nationality. LDS Humanitarian Services was created to coordinate these efforts in partnership with government and other nonprofit agencies around the world.  The church's humanitarian work primarily helps those in need who are not members of the church. There are many people in virtually any community in the world who struggle to have basic needs met. The church seeks to help as many as possible.[2] Key humanitarian initiatives include clean water, vision treatment, wheelchair provision, neonatal resuscitation, and disaster relief. Other initiatives include immunizations, family enrichment programs, and family food production. In 2008, LDS Humanitarian Services provided aid to 3.3 million people in 122 countries, and since 1985 help has been given to 23 million people in 189 nations.[3]  All of these initiatives, as well as support and advice on personal and community preparation for disasters can be found on the LDS Church's Provident Living website.
 The funding for LDS Humanitarian Services comes from philanthropic support of the church's members and other donors. Donations to the Humanitarian Fund are collected through local bishops and through LDS Philanthropies.
 In addition to these efforts, the LDS Church also has over 300 job development and placement centers around the world.  In 2001, the church began the Perpetual Education Fund which provides money to cover tuition and other school expenses to people in developing nations.  As of 2007, tens of thousands of individuals had been given assistance.  So far this program has operated primarily in South America and Oceania.  The LDS Church has also begun producing a nutrition-rich porridge named Atmit to help during acute famines.  The church welfare program owns farms, ranches, canneries, and other food producing facilities to provide temporary food relief for families and individuals.  LDS Humanitarian Services frequently works with other charities and NGOs such as the Red Cross, Catholic charities and even various Islamic charities for which the LDS Church has produced halaal food.[9]
 All of these initiatives require manpower and while there are some full-time employees in administrative and clerical functions, there are also thousands of volunteer humanitarian missionaries. In emergency situations, local members and full-time missionaries who would normally devote their time to proselyting will participate in relief efforts, but in many of these more permanent initiatives the LDS Church uses senior-aged missionary couples.
 These couples are retired church members who devote six months to two years of their time to go anywhere in the world, typically at their own expense, to participate in these projects.  Because of this volunteer force, the church is able to use 100 percent of money and goods donated in helping those in need. These missionaries often serve in activities related to their former profession. Doctors and nurses will serve medical missions either in the Neonatal Resuscitation programs or special missions to countries in need of dentists, eye doctors, surgeons and so forth.  People with agricultural or engineering backgrounds will serve on the clean water initiative or else help farmers in developing countries.
 Other members who are still working and raising families frequently donate time, money, and in-kind donations to help in these ventures. Members can volunteer at local canneries and farms to help produce food for the needy. They can volunteer to create the medical kits needed for doctors and new mothers in developing nations and many help make blankets for needy families. Many of these local initiatives are organized by the Relief Society. This volunteer force allows the LDS Church to reduce operating expenses and serve more people with their resources.
 From 1985 - 2009, $327.6 million in cash and $884.6 million in commodities of aid was given throughout 178 countries.[10]
 The church has been involved in several humanitarian aid projects in Africa. On January 27, 1985, members across the world joined together in a fast for ""the victims of famine and other causes resulting in hunger and privation among people of Africa."" They also donated the money that would have been used for food during the fast to help those victims, regardless of church membership.[11][12]:1730–1 Together with other organizations such as UNICEF and the American Red Cross, the church worked towards eradicating measles. Since 1999, there has been a 60 percent drop in deaths from measles in Africa.[13] Due to the church's efforts, the American Red Cross gave the First Presidency the organization's highest financial support honor, the American Red Cross Circle of Humanitarians award.[14] The church has also been involved in humanitarian aid in Africa by sending food boxes,[15] digging wells to provide clean water,[16] distributing wheelchairs,[17] providing Neonatal Resuscitation Training,[18] and setting up employment resources service centers.[19]"
Legal Education Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Education_Foundation	"The Legal Education Foundation is a charity dedicated to the advancement and support of legal education in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1962 as The College of Law and constituted in its present form in 2012.
 The charity began in 1962 when the Law Society's own law college (founded in 1903) merged with the tutorial firm Gibson and Weldon (founded in 1876) to form the College of Law with branches in London and Guildford.[1] The College of Law was a private teaching institution which operated as a charity. It was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1975 and officially registered as a charity in 1976 ""to promote the advancement of legal education and the study of law in all its branches"".[2] It never received Higher Education Funding Council funds and was dependent solely on its own resources to operate the college and finance its growth. In 2006 the college was granted degree-awarding powers and began a collaboration with the Sutton Trust to fund the trust's Pathways to Law program which encourages and supports disadvantaged secondary school students who wish to study law.[3] Until 2012, the College of Law was in the top 100 of UK charities ranked by expenditure.[4]
 In 2012, the College Of Law underwent a major restructuring which split off the educational institution from its parent charity. College of Law Ltd. was created as a limited company to take on its educational and training business on a for-profit basis. The parent charity changed its name to the Legal Education Foundation and remained under the Royal Charter. In November of that year the college was granted university status. Shortly thereafter it was sold to Montagu Private Equity for £200 million. The proceeds of the sale went to the Legal Education Foundation, while the £177 million debt incurred by Montagu for the purchase was transferred to the college itself. The college subsequently changed its name to the University of Law.[5][6]
 The newly constituted Legal Education Foundation officially launched on 10 July 2013 with the announcement of its first six grants and the appointment of Matthew Smerdon as its first CEO. Smerdon was recruited from the Baring Foundation, where he specialised in funding the legal advice sector.[7] The charity had begun investing its £200 million endowment in April 2013 with its investment managers instructed to preserve the value of the fund in real terms and produce an annual income of 3.5%. By the beginning of 2015 it had distributed approximately £5m in grants to nearly 70 projects which were designed to increase accessibility to legal services or to increase public understanding of the law. The foundation also initiated and runs the Justice First fellowship program which funds trainee solicitors who wish to work in the social welfare sector. In 2014 it awarded Justice First fellowships to eight law graduates recruited from a field of 161 applicants. In 2016, the program was expanded to include two further fellowships for trainee barristers.[8][9] The charity has continued and expanded its collaboration with the Sutton Trust in the Pathways to Law program and also collaborates with the Baring Foundation in widening public access to legal advice.[10][11] In addition to the income from its own endowment, the Legal Education Foundation also receives grants for its projects from general funding organizations such as Comic Relief and the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation.[8]"

Lepra	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepra	"Lepra is a UK registered international charity (NGO). They work on projects in India, Bangladesh and Mozambique to treat, educate, rehabilitate and give a voice to people affected by disease, poverty, prejudice and discrimination.
 Lepra started life in 1924 as the 'British Empire Leprosy Relief Association', by Sir Leonard Rogers, with financial help from 
Sir Frank Carter, a Calcutta businessman and philanthropist.[1][2] Since then Lepra has grown to be an international charity giving a voice to people living at the intersection of disease, poverty and prejudice by helping them to improve their physical health, mental health, lives and livelihoods.
 In the beginning, Lepra stated they wished to ‘to rid the Empire of leprosy’ as a medical organisation, spearheading outpatient work instead of resorting to traditional methods of segregating people with leprosy. Lepra now addresses not only leprosy, but also other diseases of poverty including malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and lymphatic filariasis.
 Throughout Lepra’s history, the reigning monarch has always been Lepra’s patron. In the 1950s, King George VI became the first of the Royal family to sponsor children through their adoption scheme at the time. Queen Elizabeth II is the current patron.
 Lepra currently has projects in Mozambique, Bangladesh and in the following states in India:
 As the world’s first leprosy prevention organisation Lepra is one of the world’s leading authorities on leprosy. Lepra publishes academic research on leprosy in the quarterly Leprosy Review, the only English language journal on leprosy, and promotes sharing of best practice in the field.
 Lepra has built a global reputation for scientific research and has a research centre in Hyderabad, India."
Li Ka Shing Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Ka_Shing_Foundation	"The Li Ka Shing Foundation (李嘉誠基金會) is a Hong Kong-based charitable organization founded in 1980 by Hong Kong entrepreneur Li Ka-shing. It is the second largest private foundation led by a wealthy individual in the world, after Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[1]
 Li Ka-shing considers the Li Ka Shing Foundation to be his ""third son"" and has pledged to donate one-third of his assets to support philanthropic projects. He has called for other Asian entrepreneurs to do the same, in the hope of altering the traditional notion of passing wealth through lineage.
 The Li Ka Shing Foundation's story stretches back over three decades: Having grown up witness to suffering and illness, Li Ka-shing cultivated a compassion that set in motion the idea of establishing a charitable foundation.
 Li Ka Shing Foundation supports projects that promote social progress through expanding access to quality education and medical services and research, encouraging cultural diversity and community involvement.
 Every project and every donation stems from Li Ka-shing's belief in the inherent value of each human life, regardless of race, class, or circumstance. He has devoted himself to helping others overcome the educational and physical barriers preventing them from achieving their potential.
 To date, Li Ka Shing Foundation has granted approximately HK$14.5 billion (US$1.86 billion) in charitable donations, approximately 90% in support of education reform initiatives and medical services in Greater China region.

Lifeline Express	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeline_Express	"The Lifeline Express, or Jeevan Rekha Express, is a hospital train that runs in India that began in 1991.[1][2] It was a collaboration between the Impact India Foundation (IIF), Indian Railways (IR) and the Health Ministry. The train is funded by IIF, international charitable sources, Indian corporations and individuals.[citation needed] The train has made a health impact both in India, as well as around the world where it has inspired similar initiatives.
 The Lifeline Express was started to provide on-the-spot diagnostic, medical and advanced surgical treatment for preventive and curative interventions for disabled adults and children. It is an outreach program for inaccessible rural areas where medical services are not available, traveling via Indian Railways.[3] In addition to providing access to these much needed services, the Lifeline express seeks to improve the efficiency of the existing local government and voluntary health infrastructure and services, as well as providing initiative and encouragement for the local bodies to get involved in all aspects of the programme and provide follow-up services after the train has left.
 The Lifeline Express went on its maiden journey on 16 July 1991.[2][3] Three coaches were donated by IR, and the equipment from Impact India Foundation.[2] Impact India Foundation is the Indian branch of a non-profit organisation based in seven countries around the world, with its Indian headquarters in Mumbai. Impact India still runs the trains with help from IR and corporate and private donors.
 After 16 years of work (93 projects in different parts of India) from the Lifeline Express, IR provided the Lifeline Express with five new coaches, for the new and improved Jeevan Rekha Express. There was just one operation theater in the old one; however according to the CEO of the Lifeline Express Dr. Rajnish Gourh the operation theatres would be doubled now. The rest of the setup remains same.
 The Lifeline Express provides a number of medical services including
 The train visits different parts of the country, usually rural areas with insufficient Health Care facilities, or areas hit by natural disasters, etc., and stays in each place for 21 to 25 days while medical care (routine as well as major surgery) is provided to the local people. The train which was started in 1991 is still operating.
 The Lifeline Express train is formed of specially-designed air-conditioned coaches. In 2007 Indian Railways provided five new coaches for the service. The first coach is a power car which also has a staff compartment and pantry area. The staff compartment is situated at the rear with a 12-berth staff-quarter, kitchen unit, water purifier, a gas stove and electric oven and refrigerator. The second coach consists of the medical store, as well as two autoclave units. It also houses a drawing room. The train has a main Operation Theatre with three operating tables and a second self-contained operating theatre with two tables. In the main theatre, each table has its own set of anesthetic equipment, shadow lights, Boyles apparatus with Halothane vapourisers and imported Carl Zeiss microscope, multi-purpose monitor, defibrillator, diathermy cautery machine, anesthesia ventilator. The theatres are equipped with a closed circuit television camera which is used in providing training to local doctors in live surgical procedures. An attached six bed recovery room is situated beside the main theatre.
 Additionally, the train has an ophthalmologic testing room, a dental unit, a laboratory, an X-ray unit and an auditorium with a large LCD display unit. The train also has a public address system and closed-circuit TV."
Lilly Endowment	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilly_Endowment	"Lilly Endowment Inc., headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, is one of the world's largest private philanthropic foundations and among the largest endowments in the United States. It was founded in 1937 by Josiah K. (J. K.) Lilly Sr. and his sons, Eli Jr. and Josiah Jr. (Joe), with an initial gift of Eli Lilly and Company stock valued at $280,000 USD ($4,616,759 in 2015 chained dollars).[3] As of 2014 its total assets are worth $9.96 billion.[4]
 J. K. Lilly Sr. initially served on the foundation's board and became its largest contributor. Over time he donated Eli Lilly and Company stock worth a total of $86.8 million to the foundation, including a $30 million bequest following his death in 1948. J. K's sons, Eli and Joe, contributed additional Eli Lilly and Company stock that had a combined value of $6.8 million. Eli also managed the foundation in its early years.[3][5] The Lilly Endowment's first full-time staff members, Josiah K. Lilly III and G. Harold Duling, were hired in 1951.[6] By the mid-1970s the foundation's staff had increased to seventy-five and it had moved to larger headquarters at 2801 North Meridian Street in Indianapolis.[7]
 As required under the Tax Reform Act of 1969, the Lilly Endowment diversified its holdings, but its assets consist primarily of Eli Lilly and Company stock.[5] In 1998 the Lilly Endowment became the wealthiest philanthropic endowment in the world in terms of assets (estimated value of $15.4 billion) and charitable giving. As of 2014 it remains among the top five in terms of total assets ($9.96 billion).[4][5]
 The private family foundation is a separate entity from the Eli Lilly and Company pharmaceutical firm, and maintains its headquarters in a different location. With the exception of the Eli Lilly and Company stock that the foundation holds in its portfolio, the Lilly Endowment is not linked to the Lilly pharmaceutical company. The non-profit foundation has its own board of directors to manage its affairs and an executive committee (trustees) that reviews grant requests.[5]
 The Lilly Endowment has historically focused on three primary grant areas: community development, education and Christianity. It is the largest private foundation in the United States that funds almost exclusively in its home city and state, and is one of few major foundations to fund religion.[citation needed]
 Although it has provided gifts with a national and global reach, the Lilly Endowment's primary geographic focus has been in Indianapolis and in Indiana.[8] Early recipients included the Indianapolis Community Chest, a forerunner of the United Way, the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, Christ Church Cathedral, among other Protestant and, later, Catholic institutions in the state, and several Indiana colleges and universities, such as Wabash College and Earlham College.[9] Other major gifts helped to fund construction projects in downtown Indianapolis, including the Indiana Convention Center, the Hoosier Dome (the city's first, domed stadium), and restoration of several of the city's historic buildings, including the Hilbert Circle Theater, the Indiana Theater, and grants to construct the Indianapolis Zoo, Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, and sports facilities on the Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis campus and elsewhere in the city.[10]
 One of the Lilly Endowment's most remarkable achievements is its Giving Indiana Funds for Tomorrow (GIFT) initiative. Since 1987 the initiative has been responsible for starting and growing Indiana community foundations. Indiana has more community foundations than any other state, with combined assets of nearly $3.6 billion.[11]
 From its inception the Lilly Endowment has supported numerous religious endeavors. These include Indianapolis's Christ Church Cathedral. J. K. Lilly Sr. was involved with the church throughout his life, beginning as a choirboy. Upon Lilly's death, a stipulation of his bequest to the church was that it remain in the heart of downtown Indianapolis. Lilly supported a wide variety of religious endeavors, which he considered an important means of promoting character development.[citation needed]
 Institutions and programs funded by Lilly grants have included:
 Other Lilly Endowments beneficiaries have included:
 Over the years the Lilly Endowment has acquired a collection of important Indiana paintings that were in danger of leaving the state, including works by William Merritt Chase, John Elwood Bundy, and members of the Hoosier Group. The works of art are generally displayed at the foundation's offices on North Meridian Street in Indianapolis. In 2003-05, a number of the paintings appeared in museums around Indiana as part of a special exhibition.[citation needed]"
Lions Clubs International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Clubs_International	"Lions Clubs International (LCI) is an international non-political service organization established originally in 1917 in Chicago, Illinois, by Melvin Jones.[1] It is now headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois. As of April 2015[update], it had over 46,000 local clubs and more than 1.7 million members (Lions & LEO) in 190 countries around the world.[citation needed]
 Lions Clubs International, a service membership organization of over 1.7 million members worldwide (as of June 2018), was founded in Evansville, Indiana on 24 October 1916 by Dr. William Perry Woods and subsequently evolved as an international service organization under the guidance and supervision of its Secretary, Melvin Jones.
 In 1917, Melvin Jones, was a 38-year-old Chicago business leader who told members of his local business club they should reach beyond business issues and address the betterment of their communities and the world. Jones' group, the Business Circle of Chicago, agreed.  After contacting similar groups around the United States, an organizational meeting was held on June 7, 1917, in Chicago, Illinois, US. The Business Circle subsequently joined one of the invited groups, the ""International Association of Lions Clubs"" and at a national convention held in Dallas, Texas, later that year, those who were assembled:  (1) adopted a Constitution, By-Laws, Code of Ethics and an Emblem; (2) established as a main tenet ""unselfish service to others"",  (3) unanimously elected Dr. William Perry Woods as its first President effectively securing his leadership for the first two years of the existence of the International Association of Lions, and (4) selected Melvin Jones to serve as the Organization's Secretary-Treasurer.[2]
 The Lions motto is ""We Serve"". Local Lions Club programs include sight conservation, hearing and speech conservation, diabetes awareness, youth outreach, international relations, environmental issues, and many other programs.[3] The discussion of politics  and religion is forbidden. The LIONS acronym also stands for Liberty, Intelligence, Our Nations' Safety.[4]
 The stated purposes of Lions Clubs International are:
 Much of the focus of Lions Clubs International work as a service club organization is to raise money for worthy causes. All funds raised by Lions Clubs from the general public are used for charitable purposes, and administrative costs are kept strictly separate and paid for by members. Some of the money raised for a club’s charity account goes toward projects that benefit the local community of an individual club.
 Lions Clubs plan and participate in a wide variety of service projects that meet the international goals of Lions Clubs International as well as the needs of their local communities.  Examples include donations to hospices,[5] or community campaigns such as Message in a bottle, a United Kingdom and Ireland initiative which places a plastic bottle with critical medical information inside the refrigerators of vulnerable people.[6] Money is also raised for international purposes. Some of this is donated in reaction to events such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) where Lions and LCIF provided disaster relief locally and from around the world, with donations and commitments surpassing US$1 million.[7] Other money is used to support international campaigns, coordinated by the Lions Clubs International Foundation (LCIF), such as Sight First and Lions World Sight Day, which was launched in 1998 to draw world media attention to the plight of sight loss in the third world.[8] Lions take on all sorts of various fundraisers to fund these projects. For example, the Dublin, Virginia Lions Club host two flea markets a year, and sell their famous Lion Dog, a fresh prepared variation of a corn dog.[9]
 Lions focus on work for the blind and visually impaired began when Helen Keller addressed the international convention at Cedar Point, Ohio, on 30 June 1925 and charged Lions to be Knights of the Blind.
 Lions also have a strong commitment to community hearing- and cancer-screening projects. In Perth, Western Australia, they have conducted hearing screening for over 30 years and provided seed funding for the Lions Ear and Hearing Institute established September 9, 2001, a center of excellence in the diagnosis, management, and research of ear and hearing disorders.[10] In Perth, Lions have also been instrumental in the establishment of the Lions Eye Institute. In Brisbane, Queensland, the Lions Medical Research Foundation provides funding to a number of researchers. Ian Frazer's initial work, leading to the development of a HPV vaccine for the human papillomavirus which could lead to cervical cancer, was funded by the Lions Medical Research Foundation.
 Lions Clubs International has supported the work of the United Nations since that organization's inception in 1945, when it was one of the non-governmental organizations invited to assist in the drafting of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, California.
 Lions Clubs International Foundation is ""Lions helping Lions serve the world"".[11] Donations provide funding in the form of grants to financially assist Lions districts with large-scale humanitarian projects that are too expensive and costly for Lions to finance on their own.[12]
The Foundation aids Lions in making a greater impact in their local communities, as well as around the world. Through LCIF, Lions ease pain and suffering and bring healing and hope to people worldwide. Major initiatives of the foundation include the following:
 Upon endorsing the biggest ever collaborative disease eradication programme called the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases launched on 30 January 2012 in London, the organization has implemented SightFirst program by which it aims to eradicate blindness due to trachoma, one of the neglected tropical diseases. It has allocated over US$11 million in 10 countries for eye surgeries, medical training, distribution of Zithromax and tetracycline, and sanitary services. It has also announced US$6.9 million funding to support the Government of China for the same cause.[14][15]
 Membership in the Lions Club is by ""invitation only"" as mandated by its constitution and by-laws. All member applicants need a sponsor who is an active member and of good standing in the club they intend to join. While sponsorship may be obtained by an applicant in order to become a legitimate member, sponsorship is no guarantee of membership. Acceptance of membership is still subject to the approval of the majority of the club's board of directors. Several clubs are even difficult for applicants to join in. A Lions Club chooses its members diligently as it requires time and financial commitments. Prospective applicants must be a person of good moral character in his or her community. Attendance at meetings is encouraged on a monthly or fortnightly basis. Due to the hierarchical nature of Lions Clubs International, members have the opportunity to advance from a local club to an office at the zone, district, multiple district, and international levels.
 In 1987 the constitution of Lions Clubs International was amended to allow for women to become members.[16] Since then many clubs have admitted women, but some all-male clubs still exist. In 2003, 8 out of 17 members at the Lions Club in Worcester, England, resigned when a woman joined the club.[17] Despite this setback the club has managed to rebuild and now has 19 members, 7 of whom are women. Women's membership numbers continue to grow throughout the association.
 Among the famous and noteworthy members of Lions International are former U.S. President, Jimmy Carter;[18] Her Royal Highness Sophie, Countess of Wessex, a member of the Wokingham Lions Club and Royal Patron of the Lions Clubs of the British Isles and Ireland;[19] Murray M. Silver, Jr, an American rock music writer, photographer and author, who belongs to Savannah Lions Club in Georgia; Amelia Earhart,[20] pioneer U. S. aviator, author, and advocate for women's rights; Richard E. Byrd,[21] deputy admiral of the United States Navy, aviator, pioneer and polar explorer; and Helen Keller, American writer, lecturer and social activist.[22]
 Lions Clubs International gives various awards for outstanding merits.[23]
 The Medal of Merit (MM) is the highest award from Lions Clubs International to non-members for outstanding contributions to Lions Clubs International and its goals.
 The District Governor Award (DGA) is one of the highest awards from Lions Clubs International to its members having done exceptional services.
 The President's Appreciation Award (PAA) is the highest award that can be awarded to an outstanding club.
 The Melvin Jones Fellowship (MJF) Award is the highest recognition from the Lions Clubs International Foundation being given to members who have rendered outstanding community services.
 The organization became international on 12 March 1920, when the first club in Canada was established in Windsor, Ontario. Lions Clubs have since spread across the globe and have a current membership roster of 1.4 million members worldwide.[24]
 In addition to adult Lions Clubs, the Lions family includes Lioness Clubs, Leo Clubs, Campus Lions Clubs and Lion Cubs. These divisions are parts of Lions Clubs International.
 Lioness Club Membership is generally for women, with exceptions of men also becoming Lioness members nowadays.[citation needed] They are formed under a parent Lions Club. The Lions Club thus becomes the Parent Club for the Lioness Club. Naming of the Club is also like that of the Lions Club—e.g., Lions Club of Satara United Dist 323D-1 forming and sponsoring a Lioness Club Satara United District 323D-1. In many areas, particularly the United States, Lioness clubs have disbanded and merged into their parent clubs to make a more effective club as a whole.[citation needed]
 Leo Clubs are an extension of the Lions service organization which aims to encourage community service and involvement from a young age. Leo Clubs much like Lioness Clubs are sponsored by a parent Lions Club. Leo Clubs are a common school-based organization with members between the ages of 12 and 18 from the same school, these are commonly referred to as Alpha Leo Clubs. Community based clubs also exist, these generally cater for 18- to 30-year-olds and are referred to as Omega Leo Clubs. Leo Clubs are required to have a Leo Club Advisor, a member of the sponsoring Lions Club who attends meetings and provides general advice to the club. Lions International includes more than 250,000 Leo club members in over 150 countries.[25]
 Many Leos join a Campus Lions Club if they attend a university or college after high school graduation. There are more than 600 Campus Lions clubs in the world including nearly 13,000 members on college and university campuses in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, England, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Mongolia, Nepal, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uganda, United States, Venezuela, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Legon Lions Club in University of Ghana, KNUST Campus Lions and the University of KwaZulu-Natal Campus Lions Club which is the only active Campus Lions Club currently operating in the Republic of South Africa.[26]
 Lion Cubs is a youth service organization for the elementary aged students (ages eight to twelve).[27] The first club was chartered in the Owen J. Roberts School District in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States. It was developed for students in 4th through 6th grade, and therefore too young to be a Leo Club member. The clubs (one club in each of five elementary schools) started their meetings and activities in September 2008 and were officially chartered March 24, 2009. The club is sponsored by the Coventry Lions Club of District 14P. The Lion Cubs first year (2008–09) had 179 charter members.[28]
 
An international convention is held annually in cities across the globe for members to meet other Lions, elect the coming year's officers, and partake in the many activities planned.  At the convention, Lions can participate in elections and parades, display and discuss fundraisers and service projects, and trade pins and other souvenirs.  The first convention was held in 1917, the first year of the club's existence, in Dallas, Texas.  The 2006 convention was due to be held in New Orleans, but damage sustained during Hurricane Katrina meant that the convention had to be relocated to Boston.[29]
 
 Indonesian Islamic hardliners have called for a ban on the Lions Club, saying it is part of a Zionist conspiracy. The club has been called an ""infidel"" front for Freemasonry and the world Zionist movement and threatened Islam in the world's most populous Muslim country.[30]
 Given that many Freemasons are members of Lions Clubs, and its founder, Melvin Jones, was also a Freemason,[31] modern conspiracy theories have claimed that the Lions are connected to and act cohesively with Freemasonry. One example is found on Martha F. Lee's Conspiracy Rising: Conspiracy Thinking and American Public Life. It says that the ""Freemasons are apparently in cahoots with the Lions Clubs and involved in plots ranging from the distribution of aspartame to control the human mind, to the death of John Paul I, to an apparent plot to spread Zionism.""[32]
 This perception, according to a Freemasonry website, can be traced to John Robison and the Abbé Barruel's unfounded writings on the causes of the French Revolution, Léo Taxil's late 19th-century hoax and the debunked Protocols of the Elders of Zion.
 While there is no direct link between the Lions and the Masons, they are compatible and may have overlapping membership, as evidenced by a speech delivered in 2004 to a Lions Club by a Mason named James F. Kirk-White.[33] The topic of the talk was ""Sharing Freemasonry Within Your Community"".  Their compatibility, moreover, is evidenced by the Masons in Albion, New York offering space for the Lions at a Masonic Lodge.[34] Others also believe that the Lions Clubs actually are a ""secret society"" that has a great deal of secret ritual within its structure.[35] According to them the Lions are one of those social groups belonging to a secret society that demand an oath of allegiance to join.[36]
 Controversial German Author, Jan Udo Holey, often known by his penname Jan van Helsing, wrote in his 1995 book Geheimgesellschaften und ihre Macht im 20. Jahrhundert (Secret Societies and Their Power in the 20th Century) that the Lions was founded by the B'nai B'rith in Chicago in 1917 and that, like the Freemasons and other secret societies, 90% of its members are used by the elites and have no inkling of what happens in the upper echelons. Holey explained that in the lower degrees of the hierarchy these organizations are much into social work and present really good programs.[37]"
Make-A-Wish Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make-A-Wish_Foundation	"The Make-A-Wish is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in the United States that creates life-changing wishes for children with a critical illness who have reached the age of 2 1/2 and are younger than 18 at the time of referral. Potential wish kids, medical professionals, parents, legal guardians and family members with detailed knowledge of the child's current medical condition can initiate the referral process.[1]
 The national headquarters and founding chapter of the Make-A-Wish is in Phoenix.[2] The organization grants wishes through its 60 chapters located throughout the United States. Make-A-Wish also operates in 45 other countries around the world through 38 other affiliate offices.[3]
 In the spring of 1980, 7-year-old Christopher James Greicius (August 13, 1972 – May 3, 1980) was being treated for leukemia. He aspired to be a police officer. U.S. Customs Officer Tommy Austin befriended Chris and worked with officers at the Arizona Department of Public Safety to plan an experience to lift Greicius' spirits. Chris spent the day as a police officer, rode in a police helicopter, received a custom-tailored police uniform, and was sworn in as the first honorary Public Safety patrolman in state history. Greicius died soon after, but his wish became the inspiration for the Make-A-Wish organization.[4]
Professional wrestler John Cena holds the title for the most wishes granted by a single individual, with over 600 wishes.[5] Singer Justin Bieber has volunteered in over 250 wishes.[6] National women's collegiate sorority Chi Omega has raised over $20 million and has volunteered over 1 million hours of service for Make-A-Wish. Because of this commitment, Make-A-Wish recognizes Chi Omega as one of their Cause Champion sponsors. [7]
 Children who may be eligible to receive a wish can be referred by one of the following three sources: 
 To refer a child, the appropriate referral source can use Make-A-Wish’s online inquiry form or contact the Make-A-Wish chapter closest to them. All medical information is considered confidential and is not discussed with outside parties unless it is required for the wish and the child’s parent(s) or guardian(s) have given their consent.
 A child with a critical condition who has reached the age of 2 1/2 and is under the age of 18 at the time of referral, is potentially eligible for a wish. After a child is referred, the child’s treating physician must determine whether the child is medically eligible for a wish, based on the medical criteria established by Make-A-Wish. In addition, a child cannot have received a wish from another wish-granting organization.[8]
 Each Make-A-Wish chapter follows specific policies and guidelines for granting a child’s wish. Make-A-Wish works closely with the wish child’s physician and family to determine the most appropriate time to grant the wish, keeping in mind the child’s treatment protocol or other concerns. Most wish requests fall into five categories: I wish to go, I wish to be, I wish to meet, I wish to have, or I wish to give.[8]
 The national board of directors helps chart Make-A-Wish’s course. The board has a vast array of experience and skills that help maintain Make-A-Wish’s status as the largest wish-granting organization in the U.S. The board determines the mission and vision, evaluates and supports the president and chief executive officer, and protects Make-A-Wish’s assets. The board enhances Make-A-Wish’s public standing, ensures accountability, maintains legal integrity, and assesses its own performance.[9]
 The senior leadership team is composed of Make-A-Wish’s top-level management. Each member is a national office leader in disciplines that include wish-granting, fundraising, legal, brand advancement, and operational activities. The president and CEO guides the strategic plan in areas such as board development, talent development, fundraising, and corporate relations.[9]
 Make-A-Wish stopped granting wishes involving hunting-related activities, including fishing, use of firearms or other weapons that are designed to cause animal injury in 1996. This was largely due to concerns over child safety, the pressure from animal-sensitive donors, and criticisms from animal rights groups.[10] In response, three organizations were formed: Hunt of a Lifetime, which arranges hunting trips for terminally ill children;[11][12] Catch-a-Dream,[13] which was conceived by Mississippi outdoorsman Bruce Brady and formed by his loved ones following Brady's death from cancer to grant hunting experiences to ill children; and Life Hunts, founded by the Buckmasters American Deer Foundation."
Malteser International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malteser_International	"Malteser International is an international non-governmental aid agency for humanitarian aid of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.[1] Developed in 2005 from the foreign aid service of Malteser Germany (founded 1953), and having the status of an independent eingetragener Verein since 2013, the agency has more than 50 years of experience in humanitarian relief.[2]  It currently implements around 100 projects in over 20 countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas.[3] The organization has regional headquarters for Europe and the Americas, and its General Secretariat is located in Cologne, Germany. The membership of Malteser International consists of 27 national associations and priories of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, who are responsible for supporting the organization within their jurisdictions.[4]
 In 1992, the foreign aid department of Malteser Germany combined forces with other relief services of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta around the world to form the Emergency Corps of the Order of Malta (ECOM). ECOM provided relief after natural and man-made disasters, such as the Kosovo War (1998-1999) and the 2003 Bam earthquake in Iran.[2] Malteser International was created to replace ECOM as the worldwide relief agency of the Order of Malta, in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean, broadening its mission to include long-term rehabilitation and development programmes.[1]
 Some of the organisation's most important deployments include:[2]
 27 national associations and priories of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta are currently members of Malteser International. Their representatives, together with the board of directors, the secretary-general, the vice secretary-general and the chaplain of Malteser International, form the General Assembly. The Board of Directors consists of the President and up to six Vice-Presidents. The Secretary General manages the operational activities in line with the adopted budget and the strategy of Malteser International.[4]
 Malteser International is committed by its statutes to helping people in all parts of the world without distinction of religion, race or political persuasion. Christian values and the humanitarian principles of impartiality and independence are the foundation of its work. Despite being a Catholic organisation, Malteser International works also in non-Christian countries and therefore employs workers from various religious backgrounds in its projects.[1] The overwhelming majority of Malteser International's more than 980 staff members are local people,[5] while the organization works closely with local partner organisations, including other Order of Malta organizations, both religious and non-religious NGOs, and church structures in its project countries. Malteser International adheres to several internationally recognized codes and standards, such as the ""Code of Conduct"" (Principles of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Response Programmes) and the ""Sphere Project"".[6]

Mastercard Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastercard_Foundation	"Mastercard Foundation is a global foundation established by Mastercard in 2006. Since its creation, the Foundation has partnered with a number of worldwide Non-governmental organizations and core partners aiming to ameliorate financial life, primarily in the Global South.[1] Its objective is to use a $2 billion endowment on Microfinance programs. With these programs, the Foundation's goal is to make global economics more accessible to people around the world. These programs also strive to give youth around the world new educational experiences and access to financial services and programs.[2]
 Mastercard Foundation was founded in 2006, operating primarily out of Toronto. It began as a board made up of five American directors and two Canadian directors, with chairwoman Lois Juliber.[4] During the Foundation's infancy however, it began to emphasize the American contributions, and two years after the initial board was formed they named Reeta Roy as president and CEO of the Foundation.
 The Mastercard Foundation has many partners all over the world, including:
 The Foundation and partners collaborate in an attempt to increase access to financial inclusion programs and services.[7]
 Other partners include: 
 The Mastercard Foundation is also in partnership with Education for Employment (EFE). This partnership committed 3.2 million dollars to introduce MORAD, a program devised to employ 15,500 Moroccan youth with a 4 year job opportunity. This program provides career building opportunities to 3,000 university graduates, many of whom are women, and also provide employment to an additional 12,500 disadvantaged youth.[8]
 Mastercard Foundation supports a number of pilot financial inclusion projects for people living in poverty. Their projects are  focused on expanding opportunities for clients and making finance more accessible. Many of the projects are based in Africa, the goal being to better financial inclusion in the Global South.[7]
 The Mastercard Foundation’s Scholar Program is a globally recognized program that helps youth gain access to new educational opportunities thus furthering social and economic progress among disadvantaged communities. The Scholars Program is aimed at disadvantaged, but academically inclined individuals, interested in expanding their education.[5]
 Partners in the program include, but are not limited to; Queens University, the University of Gondar,[9] McGill University, the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia.[5]
 With the University of Gondar and Queens University, the Foundation has a 10 year partnership in which they have invested $24.2 million in to provide advanced education opportunities to youth with disabilities in Ethiopia and Africa. For the University of Gondar this will mean 290 undergraduate degrees, and 160 master's degrees. Queens University will provide 44 PhD opportunities to faculty members of the University of Gondar. These programs are multifaceted, allowing for a wide range of diversity in education.[10]
 McGill University will facilitate education for approximately 90 students from Africa. Two thirds of these students are participating in undergraduate degree programs - around half of which will be from the French speaking countries within Africa - and the remaining third will be those completing their master's degree programs.[11]
 The Mastercard Foundation's Fund for Rural Prosperity aids projects directed towards improving the lives of farmers and rural citizens in Africa.[12] In 2015, the Mastercard Foundation introduced a 50 million US dollar challenge fund in Nairobi, Africa. The purpose of this fund is to encourage the development of stronger small businesses and to help support smallholding farmers in Africa through improving the financial stability of the rural poor and impoverished in Nairobi. It will strive to ensure the successful completion of financial inclusion, and development of smallholder farmers in new geographic areas.[13]
 The Mastercard Foundation Fund for Rural Prosperity also has an innovation competition fund, managed by KPMG International Development Advisory Services, designed to help over one million poor, rural farming families improve their economic situation.[14]
 In Ghana, some African women such as Ayisha Fuseini have benefited from its Innovation Bursary Program (IBP) and became entrepreneurs in their own right.[15]
 [16] 
In 2008, the Master Card Foundation awarded $100,000 to each of the following microfinance training institutions.
 This money was donated to the six leading institutions to address a need for strong leadership and management skills. It was used to fund 200 scholarships to low-income staff for education in this sector.
 In 2014, the Mastercard Foundation partnered with Save the Children to help reduce unemployment rates in youth in Africa. The program is geared towards rural youth in Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda, and provides education and entrepreneurial opportunities in agriculture. Using an evidence-based model, Youth in Action looks at each participants' personal situation to determine what will guarantee them the most success in both their personal, family and community lives, then attempts to realize this success. The program also incorporates the building of reading, writing and math skills, creating meaningful employment and entrepreneurial training for youth. The end goal is to allow them to enter and thrive in the agricultural sector.[17]
 In 2011, a $50 million partnership between the Mastercard Foundation and Equity Group Foundation, supported by the Department for International Development, was founded to provide secondary education and leadership development opportunities to over 5000 students in Kenya. The program, entitled Wings to Fly, is a platform for financially disadvantaged students to attend and complete secondary school, and increase chances of admittance to higher education.[18]
 In partnership with the African Leadership Academy, the Mastercard Foundation launched the Centre for Entrepreneurial Leadership. This program expands and improves entrepreneurship programs for youth in Africa. It also allows for easier networking in order for disadvantaged youth to avail of financial help. In 2011, the Center introduced the Anzisha scholarship to identify, celebrate and mobilize youth with aspirations in entrepreneurship, and who closely examine critical needs in their region. The idea behind the Anzisha prize is for it to eventually become similar to a Nobel Prize for youth in Africa who work to develop innovative solutions to critical problems.[19] foo"
Material World Charitable Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_World_Charitable_Foundation	"The Material World Charitable Foundation, also known as the Material World Foundation (MWF), is a charitable organisation founded by English musician George Harrison in April 1973. Its launch coincided with the release of Harrison's album Living in the Material World and came about in reaction to the taxation issues that had hindered his 1971–72 aid project for refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War. Harrison assigned his publishing royalties from nine of the eleven songs on Living in the Material World, including the hit single ""Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)"", to the foundation, in perpetuity.
 The MWF's purpose is to donate to various causes and promote diverse artistic endeavours and philosophies. Its first project in the latter regard was sponsoring a 1974 revue of Indian classical music – the Music Festival from India – led by Ravi Shankar and featuring world music pioneers such as Shivkumar Sharma, Hariprasad Chaurasia, L. Subramaniam and Sultan Khan. A year after Harrison's death, proceeds from the 2002 Concert for George, along with accompanying album and film releases, went to the foundation for dispersal to appropriate charities. The Material World Charitable Foundation continues to operate under the objectives outlined by Harrison in 1974, funded by income from his donated copyrights.
 – MWF statement, September 1974
 George Harrison founded the Material World Charitable Foundation, or MWF, on 26 April 1973,[2] close to two years after he had organised the Concert for Bangladesh in New York as a benefit for refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War.[3] As effective as this relief effort had been in raising awareness in the Western world and helping to stop the war between what was then West and East Pakistan,[4] the revenue it generated for the refugees had been denied tax-exempt status in America and the UK.[5][6] In addition, up to $10 million of the funds remained in escrow,[7] subject to an IRS audit.[8] Speaking to British DJ Nicky Horne, Harrison recognised that the existence of a foundation or trust in 1971 would have ensured that all the revenue had reached UNICEF immediately, but that ""there was no real planning [for the Concert for Bangladesh] … it was an emergency.""[9]
 Harrison named the foundation after the title track to his 1973 album, Living in the Material World,[1] a composition in which he contrasts the temptations of the material world with the pursuit of spiritual goals.[10][11] To fund the MWF, Harrison donated his copyright for nine of the eleven songs on the album, ensuring a perpetual stream of income through his publishing royalties.[12][13] The album enjoyed considerable commercial success,[12][14] topping America's Billboard chart for five weeks,[15] and produced one of Harrison's most popular hit songs, ""Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)"".[16] Harrison similarly assigned to the MWF his copyright to ""Sunshine Life for Me"",[17] a track he recorded with Ringo Starr for the latter's Ringo album, another bestseller over 1973–74.[18][nb 1] For the foundation's logo, Harrison used an adaptation of the traditional Om symbol in Devanagari, as it appeared on the artwork for Material World and his subsequent album, Dark Horse (1974).[21]
 According to the stated mission of the Material World Charitable Foundation, its purpose is twofold: to serve as a charitable organisation making donations to various causes, and to sponsor and encourage artistic endeavours and ""alternative life views and philosophies"".[1][22] During the same conversation with Horne, in August 1974, Harrison explained that, as with his recently launched Dark Horse record label,[23] his inspiration for the foundation was similar to what the Beatles had intended for their Apple organisation in 1968: ""a foundation in which we could help [people]"".[9] The establishment of the Material World Charitable Foundation ensured that all the money he personally made through music and wished to donate could find its way to the cause of his choice,[24] whereas otherwise, to donate £10 he had to earn at least ten times that amount.[9][nb 2]
 Harrison credited his friendship with Indian musician Ravi Shankar as being instrumental in his aims for the MWF, since Shankar had led him to a greater appreciation of other cultures and their music.[9] The foundation's first venture was to sponsor Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from India,[30][23] the debut performance of which took place at London's Royal Albert Hall on 23 September 1974.[31] Harrison had first envisioned such a festival of Indian classical music in 1967–68,[30] as a means of presenting India's musical and cultural heritage to a Western audience.[32] The Music Festival brought together established pioneers of the genre, such as Shivkumar Sharma and Hariprasad Chaurasia,[33] and future international stars including L. Subramaniam and Sultan Khan.[34][35][36] The foundation also sponsored a series of European concerts by this ensemble of musicians and singers.[23][37] Harrison biographer Simon Leng writes of the achievement in staging the Music Festival: ""In effect, this was the first Indian orchestra to appear in Europe.""[38] Three of the concerts on Harrison and Shankar's joint North American tour at the end of that year were benefits for the Material World Charitable Foundation.[39]
 After Harrison's death in November 2001, his hit song ""My Sweet Lord"" was reissued as a charity single,[40][41] the proceeds from which the MWF distributed to organisations such as Médecins Sans Frontières, Great Ormond Street Hospital and Britain's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.[22] The foundation then sponsored the 2002 Concert for George tribute, and the funds raised through associated film and album releases in 2003 similarly went to the MWF for distribution to charitable causes.[42][43] In his 2009 book You Never Give Me Your Money, author Peter Doggett wrote that the Material World Charitable Foundation ""continues to fund worthy causes to this day"".[44] Another humanitarian initiative resulting from the Concert for Bangladesh, the George Harrison Fund for UNICEF, remains active with international projects to help provide emergency relief for children in the Horn of Africa in 2011[45] and fundraising challenges through the Association of College Unions International.[46]
 As Harrison had intended, the perpetual donation of his 1973 copyrights has continued to benefit the foundation.[22] Commercial re-releases for the songs include the remastered Living in the Material World in September 2006,[47] which added the long-unavailable B-side ""Miss O'Dell"",[48] another composition that Harrison assigned to the MWF in 1973;[49] the career-spanning compilation Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison (2009), containing ""Give Me Love"";[50][51] and Early Takes: Volume 1 (2012), which includes a demo of ""The Light That Has Lighted the World"".[52]"
Maybach Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybach_Foundation	"The Wilhelm and Karl Maybach Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that seeks to showcase Maybach engineering and design heritage to inspire innovation. Formerly the organization linked mentors with protégés worldwide, and fostering and overseeing those relationships, however now they shifting focus to other programs in Germany and working to restore a historic train.[1][2]""
 The Foundation has garnered famous supporters, many of whom credit mentoring with making a difference in their lives,[3][4][5] including Kirk Douglas,[6] Dennis Hopper,[7] Paolo Coelho,[8][9] Quincy Jones,[8][10] and LeRoy Neiman.[2][11][12]
 The Maybach Foundation receives funding from multiple sources, including the Maybach Family. The Foundation seeks most of its funding from donors and corporate partnerships from around the globe, including Daimler AG, the Maybach brand, and Silverstein Properties.[13][14]
 The Foundation is currently working with both their San Francisco and Stuttgart branches to focus on enhancing, celebrating, and sharing their heritage and tradition of innovation through their projects, additional mobile educational outreach, and design excellence for the next generation of technical innovators.[13]
 The Foundation marked each mentorship with a specific project that falls within a sector of interest. The general sectors of interest for the Foundation are science and research; art, design and architecture; community and ethics; and business and technology.[13]
 The pilot project for the mentoring program was led by Dr. David Bangsberg, M.D., a leader in HIV treatment strategies and founding dean[15] at Portland State University School of Public Health, who mentored Dr. Conrad Muzoora, M.D., a Ugandan medical researcher, head of internal medicine at the Mbarara University of Science and Technology.[16] The two focused on working together from 2008-2013 in order to successfully research treatment options for patients with HIV/AIDS in addition to at least one other infectious disease like tuberculosis and bring positive change by empowering the next generation of doctors and researchers who will remain in Uganda to fight life-threatening infectious diseases.[17]

 In a partnership between the Maybach Foundation and Silverstein Properties, four photographers were given the opportunity to document the rebuilding of the World Trade Center in New York City and mentored by Joe Woolhead, the official photographer of the World Trade Center.[20] The four photographers were Marika Asatiani (Tbilisi, Georgia), Benjamin Jarosch (New York, United States),  Nicole Tung (New York, USA), and Vicky Roy (New Delhi, India). The goal of the project was for the proteges to become skilled documentary photographers and produce a collection of images that capture the rebuilding of one of the US's most prominent landmarks, developing a generation of photographers who will raise awareness about political, cultural, and social issues.[21]
 In October 2008, the Foundation launched the Post-Apartheid Role Model Project (PARM) with the extraordinarily talented South African polo player, Sbu Duma, who was trained and mentored by top international professionals in his field, the lead mentor being Argentinian polo player, Federico Bachman.[22] Project locations included Argentina, Spain, France, Germany, and Great Britain. Tragically, Sbu Duma[23] died in May 2012 before completing his mentorship but remains an inspiration to all who aspire to achieve individual greatness and wish to share their gifts with the world.[24][25][26]
 Coinciding with the Venice Biennale 2011, the Maybach Foundation founded their art mentoring program, forming a collaborative mentorship between Julian Schnabel and Vahakn Arslanian, both New York-based artists. The goal of the mentorship project was to develop the creative potential of promising young artists who have overcome adversity and to use art to challenge the way we see the world and look to the future, these two were chosen because they were kindred spirits aiming to break down the prevailing aesthetic and establish a new way of seeing, much in the way of the revolutionary work of Wilhelm Maybach and Gottlieb Daimler. 
With the assistance of Maybach, the two were able to work together using automobile parts in art pieces to create several exhibitions for the 2011 Venice Biennale, 2011[27] St. Moritz Art Masters Event, and a 2012 exhibition entitled Holy, Heavenly in the West Village, sponsored by the foundation, Maybach Manufaktur, and Vito Schnabel.
 The arts mentorship project paired promising young artistic talent with established leaders in the art world to highlight their creativity. Up-and-coming photographer Garret Suhrie was mentored[28] by star photographer David LaChapelle as a means to motivate society to appreciate and preserve nature as a way to survive urban chaos, using art to challenge the way the natural world is viewed.[29] Suhrie documented the decaying industrial facilities in his home city of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, displaying the original sights hidden amongst the natural world. Suhrie's resulting works from the period were showen at the Maybach Center of Excellence Event in Stuttgart, Germany, where he donated two of his photographs to the Daimler Art Collection. In 2011, Suhrie was featured at the St. Moritz Art Walk.[30]
 Through this project the Maybach Foundation paired Tessa Tricks, a post-graduate student in the anthropology of food from the UK, with Sarah Weiner and other leaders[31] from the Seedling Projects organization.[32] Tessa Tricks was nominated by Aine Morris of the Sustainable Food Trust organization[33]  in the UK for her exceptional resume and experience in the Slow Food movement. The project allowed Tricks to forge relationships for future collaboration, investigate examples of best practices from the USA sustainable food movement, and help organize the 2014 Good Food Awards with her mentor.[34]
 After earning her Masters in Public Administration from Cornell University and becoming active in the Maine Seafood Marketing Network, Amanda LaBelle was mentored by Monique Coombs, the Director of Marine Programs for the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association.[35][36] The program explored opportunities for integrating seafood into Maine's local food systems and bridged the gap between agriculture and fisheries in Maine.[37][38]"
McKnight Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKnight_Foundation	"The McKnight Foundation is a philanthropic organization based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the US. In 2017, McKnight awarded around $90 million in grants. The foundation's program interests include regional economic and community development, Minnesota's arts and artists, education equity, youth engagement, Midwest climate and energy, Mississippi River water quality, neuroscience research, international crop research, and rural livelihoods. McKnight's primary geographic focus is the state of Minnesota, with significant support also directed to strategies throughout the U.S. and in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.[3]
 The McKnight Foundation was founded in 1953 by William L. McKnight, an early leader of the 3M Corporation, and Maude L. McKnight,[4] and was independently endowed by the McKnights.
 Bolstered by the estates of William and Maude McKnight, the foundation's assets grew substantially in the 1980s. In 2015, the foundation assets were approximately $2.2 billion.[3] The McKnight Foundation was ranked twenty-second on the Foundation Center's list of the largest private foundations in America.[4]
 In April 2013, the foundation announced a new program area focused on regional climate and energy issues, granting $25 million to two longtime partners working in those areas.[5]
 The McKnight Foundation's program areas are Arts, Education & Learning, International, Midwest Climate & Energy, MN Initiative Foundations, Mississippi River, Neuroscience, and Region & Communities.

 In 2014, The McKnight Foundation committed to investing $200 million, or 10% of its $2 billion endowment, in strategies that align with McKnight's mission. In addition to generating a financial return, this money is invested with three goals: quickening a transition to a low-carbon economy, protecting the Mississippi River, and contributing to a thriving, sustainable Minneapolis-St.Paul metro area.[6] McKnight's president Kate Wolford believes impact investing is vital to serving the foundations fiduciary duty, saying ""As a philanthropic fiduciary, we would embrace our role as institutional owners of our assets alongside our traditional role as grantmakers. We would consider the use of all of our resources to advance mission and public benefit, rather than just the five percent required payout for charitable purpose.""[7] As part of their commitment to impact investing, McKnight shares detailed information about their investees and their performance.[8]"
Médecins du Monde	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9decins_du_Monde	"Médecins du monde (MdM; French pronunciation: ​[medsɛ̃ dy mɔ̃d]) or Doctors of the World, provides emergency and long-term medical care to the world's most vulnerable people. It also advocates to end health inequities.
 It was founded in 1980 by a group of 15 French physicians, including Bernard Kouchner. MdM is active in over 80 countries with approximately 400 programs active, in both the developed and developing world.[1]
 MdM was formally established on 1 February 1980. Its goals were ""to go where others will not, to testify to the intolerable, and to volunteer"".
 The origins of MdM lay with Médecins Sans Frontières. During the Vietnam War, the future founding members of MdM were approached with the idea of aiding Vietnamese refugees fleeing by ship on the South China Sea.[2] The majority of the Médecins Sans Frontières were against aiding the Vietnamese refugees. However, Kouchner, along with volunteer doctors, journalists, and others organized a hospital boat, L'Île de lumière, to provide medical care and to report the refugees' suffering.
 MdM was founded as Bernard Kouchner and 14 others doctors split from the group he previously founded, Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF, or Doctors Without Borders). It has been reported Kouchner felt that MSF was giving up its founding principle of témoignage (""witnessing""), which refers to aid workers making the atrocities they observe known to the public.
 Kouchner was president of MdM from 1980 to 1982. In 1989, the foundation of MdM Spain paved the way for the creation of the MdM international network. In 2015, the MdM global network consisted of fifteen associations;  France (founded 1980), Spain (founded 1989), Greece (founded 1990), Italy and Switzerland (both founded 1993), Sweden (founded 1994), Cyprus (founded 1995 by Elena Theoharous[3]), Argentina (founded 1998), Belgium, Canada and Portugal (all founded 1999), as well as in Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, the Netherlands, and the USA.
 Doctors of the World USA, also known as MdM USA, was founded in 1990 by famous doctor and activist Jonathan Mann. The group ultimately separated from the MdM network in 2006, and became HealthRight International.
 Doctors of the World USA is the 15th chapter of the MDM network. It was re-founded by committed humanitarian activists in 2011, with Dr Abby Stoddard as its founding chair. Fraser Mooney, a long-term AIDS and social justice activist, became the organization's Executive Director in 2016.
 In 1998, Doctors of the World UK became a registered charity in England and Wales and initially only contributed to Médecins du Monde international work.   It launched its UK Programme in 2006, when they opened a clinic in Bethnal Green, in east London. The clinic provides information and medical assistance to people who face barriers to access mainstream health services, such as undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and the homeless. In 2018, a successful campaign #StopSharing, contributed to the data sharing MOU between NHS Digital and the Home Office, which had been signed as part of the Hostile Environment. 
 After the Ebola crisis West Africa in 2014, it helped run a treatment centre in Moyamba, Sierra Leone. DOTW UK volunteer Professor Bulstrode was awarded a CBE for his involvement in the Ebola crisis. It is currently providing healthcare for refugees and migrants in several countries in Europe, including Greece and Croatia, and Ukraine.
 Drs. Chris and Xand van Tulleken, who present the CBBC series Operation Ouch!, were Board Members of DOTW UK until 2018.
 MdM programs focus on four priority areas: Conflict and Crisis, Harm Reduction, Maternal and Child Health, and Migrant Populations.
 MdM operates in both the developed and developing world, aiding in treatment of refugees, reducing harm long-term, fighting sexually-transmitted diseases, and promoting sexual health and mental wellness.[4] In 2018, Doctors of the World (MdM) provided care in 79 countries with over 300 programs in North and South America, Europe, Africa and Asia.
 In 2018, the Doctors of the World international network had a budget of some 250 million euros, and provided services to more than 6.5 million people worldwide. It allocated 78.5% of its budget to programs.15.5% to fundraising, and 6% to operating expenses.[5]
 The organization is analyzed regularly by an independent committee to examine the operations of MdM and the allocation of their finances.[6] In depth audits of MdM are done by the French government and Deloitte.
 In December 2013, documents released by National Security Agency whistle blower Edward Snowden revealed that British and American intelligence agencies had been carrying on secret surveillance of several humanitarian organizations including Médecins du Monde.  Leigh Daynes, Executive Director of Doctors of the World UK said that he was ""bewildered by these extraordinary allegations of secret surveillance. Our doctors, nurses and midwives are not a threat to national security. There is absolutely no reason for our operations to be secretly monitored.""  Other humanitarian organizations targeted include the United Nations Development Programme, the children's charity UNICEF, and the head of the Economic Community of West African States.[7]"
Médecins Sans Frontières	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9decins_Sans_Fronti%C3%A8res	"Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (listen)), sometimes rendered in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. In 2015, over 30,000 personnel — mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators — provided medical aid in over 70 countries.[1] Most staff are volunteers. Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[2]
 Médecins sans frontières was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[3] To that end, the organisation emphasises ""independence and impartiality"", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.
 MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,[4] the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.[5] Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.
 MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.[6] James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize.[7] Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.
 MSF should not be confused with Médecins du Monde (Doctors of the World), which was formed in part by members of the former organisation, but is an entirely independent non-governmental organisation with no links to MSF today.
 During the Nigerian Civil War of 1967 to 1970, the Nigerian military formed a blockade around the nation's newly independent south-eastern region, Biafra. At this time, France was the only major country supportive of the Biafrans (the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States sided with the Nigerian government), and the conditions within the blockade were unknown to the world. A number of French doctors volunteered with the French Red Cross to work in hospitals and feeding centres in besieged Biafra.[3] One of the co-founders of the organisation was Bernard Kouchner, who later became a high-ranking French politician.
 After entering the country, the volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army, and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. The doctors publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. These doctors concluded that a new aid organisation was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims.[3]
 The Groupe d'intervention médicale et chirurgicale en urgence (""Emergency Medical and Surgical Intervention Group"") was formed in 1971 by French doctors who had worked in Biafra, to provide aid and to emphasize the importance of victims' rights over neutrality. At the same time, Raymond Borel, the editor of the French medical journal TONUS, had started a group called Secours Médical Français (""French Medical Relief"") in response to the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed at least 625,000 in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Borel had intended to recruit doctors to provide aid to victims of natural disasters. On 22 December 1971, the two groups of colleagues merged to form Médecins Sans Frontières.[8]
 MSF's first mission was to the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, where a 1972 earthquake had destroyed most of the city and killed between 10,000 and 30,000 people.[9] The organization, today known for its quick response in an emergency, arrived three days after the Red Cross had set up a relief mission. On 18 and 19 September 1974, Hurricane Fifi caused major flooding in Honduras and killed thousands of people (estimates vary), and MSF set up its first long-term medical relief mission.[10]
 Between 1975 and 1979, after South Vietnam had fallen to North Vietnam, millions of Cambodians emigrated to Thailand to avoid the Khmer Rouge. In response MSF set up its first refugee camp missions in Thailand.[8] When Vietnam withdrew from Cambodia in 1989, MSF started long-term relief missions to help survivors of the mass killings and reconstruct the country's health care system.[11] Although its missions to Thailand to help victims of war in Southeast Asia could arguably be seen as its first war-time mission, MSF saw its first mission to a true war zone, including exposure to hostile fire, in 1976. MSF spent nine years (1976–1984) assisting surgeries in the hospitals of various cities in Lebanon, during the Lebanese Civil War, and established a reputation for its neutrality and willingness to work under fire. Throughout the war, MSF helped both Christian and Muslim soldiers alike, helping whichever group required the most medical aid at the time. In 1984, as the situation in Lebanon deteriorated further and security for aid groups was minimised, MSF withdrew its volunteers.
 Claude Malhuret was elected as the new president of Medicins Sans Frontieres in 1977, and soon after debates began over the future of the organisation. In particular, the concept of témoignage (""witnessing""), which refers to speaking out about the suffering that one sees as opposed to remaining silent,[12] was being opposed or played down by Malhuret and his supporters. Malhuret thought MSF should avoid criticism of the governments of countries in which they were working, while Kouchner believed that documenting and broadcasting the suffering in a country was the most effective way to solve a problem.
 In 1979, after four years of refugee movement from South Vietnam and the surrounding countries by foot and by boat, French intellectuals made an appeal in Le Monde for ""A Boat for Vietnam"", a project intended to provide medical aid to the refugees. Although the project did not receive support from the majority of MSF, some, including later Minister Bernard Kouchner, chartered a ship called L’Île de Lumière (""The Island of Light""), and, along with doctors, journalists and photographers, sailed to the South China Sea and provided some medical aid to the boat people. The splinter organisation that undertook this, Médecins du Monde, later developed the idea of humanitarian intervention as a duty, in particular on the part of Western nations such as France.[13] In 2007 MSF clarified that for nearly 30 years MSF and Kouchner have had public disagreements on such issues as the right to intervene and the use of armed force for humanitarian reasons. Kouchner is in favour of the latter, whereas MSF stands up for an impartial humanitarian action, independent from all political, economic and religious powers.[14]
 In 1982, Malhuret and Rony Brauman (who became the organisation's president in 1982) brought increased financial independence to MSF by introducing fundraising-by-mail to better collect donations. The 1980s also saw the establishment of the other operational sections from MSF-France (1971): MSF-Belgium (1980), MSF-Switzerland (1981), MSF-Holland (1984), and MSF-Spain (1986). MSF-Luxembourg was the first support section, created in 1986. The early 1990s saw the establishment of the majority of the support sections: MSF-Greece (1990), MSF-USA (1990), MSF-Canada (1991), MSF-Japan (1992), MSF-UK (1993), MSF-Italy (1993), MSF-Australia (1994), as well as Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Hong Kong (MSF-UAE was formed later).[8][15] Malhuret and Brauman were instrumental in professionalising MSF. In December 1979, after the Soviet army had invaded Afghanistan, field missions were immediately set up to provide medical aid to the mujahideen, and in February 1980, MSF publicly denounced the Khmer Rouge. During the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia, MSF set up nutrition programmes in the country in 1984, but was expelled in 1985 after denouncing the abuse of international aid and the forced resettlements. MSF's explicit attacks on the Ethiopian government led to other NGOs criticizing their abandonment of their supposed neutrality and contributed to a series of debates in France around humanitarian ethics.[16][17]  The group also set up equipment to produce clean drinking water for the population of San Salvador, capital of El Salvador, after 10 October 1986 earthquake that struck the city.[8][18]  In 2014, the European Speedster Assembly had contributed $717,000 to MSF.[19]
 Since 1979, MSF has been providing medical humanitarian assistance in Sudan, a nation plagued by starvation and the civil war, prevalent malnutrition and one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. In March 2009, it is reported that MSF has employed 4,590 field staff in Sudan[20] tackling issues such as armed conflicts, epidemic diseases, health care and social exclusion. MSF's continued presence and work in Sudan is one of the organization's largest interventions. MSF provides a range of health care services including nutritional support, reproductive healthcare, Kala-Azar treatment, counselling services and surgery to the people living in Sudan.[21] Common diseases prevalent in Sudan include tuberculosis, kala-azar also known as visceral leishmaniasis, meningitis, measles, cholera, and malaria.
 Kala-azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis, has been one of the major health problems in Sudan. After the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between North and Southern Sudan on 9 January 2005, the increase in stability within the region helped further efforts in healthcare delivery. Médicins sans Frontières tested a combination of sodium stibogluconate and paromomycin, which would reduce treatment duration (from 30 to 17 days) and cost in 2008.[22] In March 2010, MSF set up its first Kala-Azar treatment centre in Eastern Sudan, providing free treatment for this otherwise deadly disease. If left untreated, there is a fatality rate of 99% within 1–4 months of infection.[23] Since the treatment centre was set up, MSF has cured more than 27,000 Kala-Azar patients with a success rate of approximately 90–95%.[24] There are plans to open an additional Kala-Azar treatment centre in Malakal, Southern Sudan to cope with the overwhelming number of patients that are seeking treatment. MSF has been providing necessary medical supplies to hospitals and training Sudanese health professionals to help them deal with Kala-Azar.[25] MSF, Sudanese Ministry of Health and other national and international institutions are combining efforts to improve on the treatment and diagnosis of Kala-Azar.[26] Research on its cures and vaccines are currently being conducted.[26] In December 2010, South Sudan was hit with the worst outbreak of Kala-Azar in eight years.[20] The number of patients seeking treatment increased eight-fold as compared to the year before.[20]
 Sudan's latest civil war began in 1983 and ended in 2005 when a peace agreement was signed between North Sudan and South Sudan.[20] MSF medical teams were active throughout and prior to the civil war, providing emergency medical humanitarian assistance in multiple locations.[20] The situation of poor infrastructure in the South was aggravated by the civil war and resulted in the worsening of the region's appalling health indicators. An estimated 75 percent of people in the nascent nation has no access to basic medical care and 1 in seven women dies during childbirth.[20] Malnutrition and disease outbreaks are perennial concerns as well. In 2011, MSF clinic in Jonglei State, South Sudan was looted and attacked by raiders.[27] Hundreds, including women and children were killed. Valuable items including medical equipment and drugs were lost during the raid and parts of the MSF facilities were destroyed in a fire.[27] The incident had serious repercussions as MSF is the only primary health care provider in this part of Jonglei State.[27]
 The early 1990s saw MSF open a number of new national sections, and at the same time, set up field missions in some of the most dangerous and distressing situations it had ever encountered.
 In 1990, MSF first entered Liberia to help civilians and refugees affected by the Liberian Civil War.[28] Constant fighting throughout the 1990s and the Second Liberian Civil War have kept MSF volunteers actively providing nutrition, basic health care, and mass vaccinations, and speaking out against attacks on hospitals and feeding stations, especially in Monrovia.[29]
 Field missions were set up to provide relief to Kurdish refugees who had survived the al-Anfal Campaign, for which evidence of atrocities was being collected in 1991.[30] 1991 also saw the beginning of the civil war in Somalia, during which MSF set up field missions in 1992 alongside a UN peacekeeping mission. Although the UN-aborted operations by 1993, MSF representatives continued with their relief work, running clinics and hospitals for civilians.[31]
 MSF first began work in Srebrenica (in Bosnia and Herzegovina) as part of a UN convoy in 1993, one year after the Bosnian War had begun. The city had become surrounded by the Bosnian Serb Army and, containing about 60,000 Bosniaks, had become an enclave guarded by a United Nations Protection Force. MSF was the only organisation providing medical care to the surrounded civilians, and as such, did not denounce the genocide for fear of being expelled from the country (it did, however, denounce the lack of access for other organisations). MSF was forced to leave the area in 1995 when the Bosnian Serb Army captured the town. 40,000 Bosniak civilian inhabitants were deported, and approximately 7,000 were killed in mass executions.[32]
 When the genocide in Rwanda began in April 1994, some delegates of MSF working in the country were incorporated into the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) medical team for protection. Both groups succeeded in keeping all main hospitals in Rwanda's capital Kigali operational throughout the main period of the genocide. MSF, together with several other aid organisations, had to leave the country in 1995, although many MSF and ICRC volunteers worked together under the ICRC's rules of engagement, which held that neutrality was of the utmost importance. These events led to a debate within the organisation about the concept of balancing neutrality of humanitarian aid workers against their witnessing role. As a result of its Rwanda mission, the position of MSF with respect to neutrality moved closer to that of the ICRC, a remarkable development in the light of the origin of the organisation.[33]
 The ICRC lost 56 and MSF lost almost one hundred of their respective local staff in Rwanda, and MSF-France, which had chosen to evacuate its team from the country (the local staff were forced to stay), denounced the murders and demanded that a French military intervention stop the genocide. MSF-France introduced the slogan ""One cannot stop a genocide with doctors"" to the media, and the controversial Opération Turquoise followed less than one month later.[8] This intervention directly or indirectly resulted in movements of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees to Zaire and Tanzania in what became known as the Great Lakes refugee crisis, and subsequent cholera epidemics, starvation and more mass killings in the large groups of civilians. MSF-France returned to the area and provided medical aid to refugees in Goma.[34]
 At the time of the genocide, competition between the medical efforts of MSF, the ICRC, and other aid groups had reached an all-time high,[35] but the conditions in Rwanda prompted a drastic change in the way humanitarian organisations approached aid missions. The Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief Programmes was created by the ICRC in 1994 to provide a framework for humanitarian missions and MSF is a signatory of this code.[36] The code advocates the provision of humanitarian aid only, and groups are urged not to serve any political or religious interest, or be used as a tool for foreign governments.[37] MSF has since still found it necessary to condemn the actions of governments, such as in Chechnya in 1999,[38] but has not demanded another military intervention since then.[8]
 In the late 1990s, MSF missions were set up to treat tuberculosis and anaemia in residents of the Aral Sea area, and look after civilians affected by drug-resistant disease, famine, and epidemics of cholera and AIDS.[39] They vaccinated 3 million Nigerians against meningitis during an epidemic in 1996[40] and denounced the Taliban's neglect of health care for women in 1997.[41] Arguably, the most significant country in which MSF set up field missions in the late 1990s was Sierra Leone, which was involved in a civil war at the time. In 1998, volunteers began assisting in surgeries in Freetown to help with an increasing number of amputees, and collecting statistics on civilians (men, women and children) being attacked by large groups of men claiming to represent ECOMOG. The groups of men were travelling between villages and systematically chopping off one or both of each resident's arms, raping women, gunning down families, razing houses, and forcing survivors to leave the area.[42] Long-term projects following the end of the civil war included psychological support and phantom limb pain management.[43]
 The Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines was created in late 1999, providing MSF with a new voice with which to bring awareness to the lack of effective treatments and vaccines available in developing countries. In 1999, the organisation also spoke out about the lack of humanitarian support in Kosovo and Chechnya, having set up field missions to help civilians affected by the respective political situations. Although MSF had worked in the Kosovo region since 1993, the onset of the Kosovo War prompted the movement of tens of thousands of refugees, and a decline in suitable living conditions. MSF provided shelter, water and health care to civilians affected by NATO's strategic bombing campaigns.[44]
 A serious crisis within MSF erupted in connection with the organisation's work in Kosovo when the Greek section of MSF was expelled from the organization. The Greek MSF section had gained access to Serbia at the cost of accepting Serb government imposed limits on where it could go and what it could see – terms that the rest of the MSF movement had refused.[45]  A non-MSF source alleged that the exclusion of the Greek section happened because its members extended aid to both Albanian and Serbian civilians in Pristina during NATO's bombing,[46]
The rift was healed only in 2005 with the re-admission of the Greek section to MSF.
 A similar situation was found in Chechnya, whose civilian population was largely forced from their homes into unhealthy conditions and subjected to the violence of the Second Chechen War.[47]
 MSF has been working in Haiti since 1991, but since President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was forced from power, the country has seen a large increase in civilian attacks and rape by armed groups. In addition to providing surgical and psychological support in existing hospitals – offering the only free surgery available in Port-au-Prince – field missions have been set up to rebuild water and waste management systems and treat survivors of major flooding caused by Hurricane Jeanne; patients with HIV/AIDS and malaria, both of which are widespread in the country, also receive better treatment and monitoring.[48] As a result of 12 January 2010 Haiti earthquake, reports from Haiti indicated that all three of the organisation's hospitals had been severely damaged; one collapsing completely and the other two having to be abandoned.[49] Following the quake, MSF sent about nine planes loaded with medical equipment and a field hospital to help treat the victims. However, the landings of some of the planes had to be delayed due to the massive number of humanitarian and military flights coming in.[50]
 The Kashmir Conflict in northern India resulted in a more recent MSF intervention (the first field mission was set up in 1999) to help civilians displaced by fighting in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as in Manipur. Psychological support is a major target of missions, but teams have also set up programmes to treat tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria.[51] Mental health support has been of significant importance for MSF in much of southern Asia since the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.[52]
 MSF went through a long process of self-examination and discussion in 2005–2006. Many issues were debated, including the treatment ""nationals"" as well as ""fair employment"" and self-criticism.[53]
 MSF has been active in a large number of African countries for decades, sometimes serving as the sole provider of health care, food, and water. Although MSF has consistently attempted to increase media coverage of the situation in Africa to increase international support, long-term field missions are still necessary. Treating and educating the public about HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, which sees the most deaths and cases of the disease in the world,[54] is a major task for volunteers. Of the 14.6 million people in need of anti-retroviral treatment the WHO estimated that only 5.25 million people were receiving it in developing countries, and MSF continues to urge governments and companies to increase research and development into HIV/AIDS treatments to decrease cost and increase availability.[55] (See AIDS in Africa for more information)
 Although active in the Congo region of Africa since 1985, the First and Second Congo War brought increased violence and instability to the area. MSF has had to evacuate its teams from areas such as around Bunia, in the Ituri district due to extreme violence,[56] but continues to work in other areas to provide food to tens of thousands of displaced civilians, as well as treat survivors of mass rapes and widespread fighting.[57] The treatment and possible vaccination against diseases such as cholera, measles, polio, Marburg fever, sleeping sickness,[58] HIV/AIDS, and Bubonic plague is also important to prevent or slow down epidemics.[59]
 MSF has been active in Uganda since 1980, and provided relief to civilians during the country's guerrilla war during the Second Obote Period. However, the formation of the Lord's Resistance Army saw the beginning of a long campaign of violence in northern Uganda and southern Sudan. Civilians were subjected to mass killings and rapes, torture, and abductions of children, who would later serve as sex slaves or child soldiers. Faced with more than 1.5 million people displaced from their homes, MSF set up relief programmes in internally displaced person (IDP) camps to provide clean water, food and sanitation. Diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, polio, cholera, ebola, and HIV/AIDS occur in epidemics in the country, and volunteers provide vaccinations (in the cases of measles and polio) and/or treatment to the residents. Mental health is also an important aspect of medical treatment for MSF teams in Uganda since most people refuse to leave the IDP camps for constant fear of being attacked.[60][61]
 MSF first camp set up a field mission in Côte d'Ivoire in 1990, but ongoing violence and the 2002 division of the country by rebel groups and the government led to several massacres, and MSF teams have even begun to suspect that an ethnic cleansing is occurring.[62] Mass measles vaccinations,[63] tuberculosis treatment and the re-opening of hospitals closed by fighting are projects run by MSF, which is the only group providing aid in much of the country.[62]
 MSF has strongly promoted the use of contraception in Africa.
 During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, MSF met serious medical demands largely on its own, after the organisation's early warnings were largely ignored.[64]
 In 2014 MSF partnered with satellite operator SES, other NGOs Archemed, Fondation Follereau, Friendship Luxembourg and German Doctors, and the Luxembourg government in the pilot phase of SATMED, a project to use satellite broadband technology to bring eHealth and telemedicine to isolated areas of developing countries. SATMED was first deployed in Sierra Leone in support of the fight against Ebola.[65]
 MSF first provided medical help to civilians and refugees who have escaped to camps along the Thai-Cambodian border in 1979. Due to long decades of war, a proper health care system in the country was severely lacking and MSF moved inland in 1989 to help restructure basic medical facilities.
 In 1999, Cambodia was hit with a malaria epidemic. The situation of the epidemic was aggravated by a lack of qualified practitioners and poor quality control which led to a market of fake antimalarial drugs. Counterfeit antimalarial drugs were responsible for the deaths of at least 30 people during the epidemic.[66] This has prompted efforts by MSF to set up and fund a malaria outreach project and utilise Village Malaria Workers.[67] MSF also introduced a switching of first-line treatment to a combination therapy (Artesunate and Mefloquine) to combat resistance and fatality of old drugs that were used to treat the disease traditionally.[68]
 Cambodia is one of the hardest hit HIV/AIDS countries in Southeast Asia. In 2001, MSF started introducing  antiretroviral (ARV) therapy to AIDS patients for free. This therapy prolongs the patients' lives and is a long-term treatment.[69] In 2002, MSF established chronic diseases clinics with the Cambodian Ministry of Health in various provinces to integrate HIV/AIDS treatment, alongside hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis which have high prevalence rate. This aims to reduce facility-related stigma as patients are able to seek treatment in a multi-purpose clinic in contrast to a HIV/AIDS specialised treatment centre.[70]
 MSF also provided humanitarian aid in times of natural disaster such as a major flood in 2002 which affected up to 1.47 million people.[71] MSF introduced a community-based tuberculosis programme in 2004 in remote villages, where village volunteers are delegated to facilitate the medication of patients. In partnership with local health authorities and other NGOs, MSF encouraged decentralized clinics and rendered localized treatments to more rural areas from 2006.[72] Since 2007, MSF has extended general health care, counselling, HIV/AIDS and TB treatment to prisons in Phnom Penh via mobile clinics.[73] However, poor sanitation and lack of health care still prevails in most Cambodian prisons as they remain as some of the world's most crowded prisons.[74]
 In 2007, MSF worked with the Cambodian Ministry of Health to provide psychosocial and technical support in offering pediatric HIV/AIDS treatment to affected children.[75] MSF also provided medical supplies and staff to help in one of the worst dengue outbreaks in 2007,[76] which had more than 40,000 people hospitalized, killing 407 people, primarily children.[77]
 In 2010, Southern and Eastern provinces of Cambodia were hit with a cholera epidemic and MSF responded by providing medical support that were adapted for usage in the country.[78]
 Cambodia is one of 22 countries listed by WHO as having a high burden of tuberculosis. WHO estimates that 64% of all Cambodians carry the tuberculosis mycobacterium. Hence, MSF has since shifted its focus away from HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis, handing over most HIV-related programs to local health authorities.[79]
 The 2011 Libyan civil war has prompted efforts by MSF to set up a hospital and mental health services to help locals affected by the conflict. The fighting created a backlog of patients that needed surgery. With parts of the country slowly returning to livable, MSF has started working with local health personnel to address the needs. The need for psychological counseling has increased and MSF has set up mental health services to address the fears and stress of people living in tents without water and electricity. Currently MSF is the only International Aid organisation with actual presence in the country.
 MSF is providing Maritime Search And Rescue (SAR) services on the Mediterranean Sea to save the lives of migrants attempting to cross with unseaworthy boats. The Mission started in 2015 after the EU ended its major SAR operation Mare Nostrum severely diminishing much needed SAR capacities in the Mediterranean.[80] Throughout the mission MSF has operated its own vessels like the Bourbon Argos (2015–2016), Dignity I (2015–2016) and Prudence (2016–2017). MSF has also provided medical teams to support other NGOs and their ships like the MOAS Phoenix (2015) or the Aquarius with SOS Méditerranée (2017–2018).[81] In August 2017 MSF decided to suspend the activities of the Prudence protesting restrictions and threats by the Libyan ""Coast Guard"".[82]
 In December 2018 MSF and SOS Méditerranée were forced to end operations of the Aquarius, the last remaining vessel supported by MSF. This came after attacks by EU states that stripped the vessel of its registration and produced criminal accusations against MSF. Up to then 80,000 people were rescued or assisted since the beginning of the mission.[83]
 MSF is involved in Sri Lanka, where a 26 year civil war ended in 2009 and MSF has adapted its activities there to continue its mission. For example, it helps with physical therapy for patients with spinal cord injuries.[84] It conducts counseling sessions, and has set up an “operating theatre for reconstructive orthopaedic surgery and supplied specialist surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses to operate on patients with complicated war-related injuries.”[85]
 MSF is involved in trying to help with the humanitarian crisis caused by the Yemeni Civil War. The organisation operates eleven hospitals and health centres in Yemen and provides support to another 18 hospitals or health centres.[86] According to MSF, since October 2015, four of its hospitals and one ambulance have been destroyed by Saudi-led coalition airstrikes.[87] In August 2016, an airstrike on Abs hospital killed 19 people, including one MSF staff member, and wounded 24.[86] According to MSF, the GPS coordinates of the hospital were repeatedly shared with all parties to the conflict, including the Saudi-led coalition, and its location was well-known.
 Before a field mission is established in a country, an MSF team visits the area to determine the nature of the humanitarian emergency, the level of safety in the area and what type of aid is needed (this is called an ""exploratory mission"").
 Medical aid is the main objective of most missions, although some missions help in such areas as water purification and nutrition.[88]
 A field mission team usually consists of a small number of coordinators to head each component of a field mission, and a ""head of mission."" The head of mission usually has the most experience in humanitarian situations of the members of the team, and it is his/her job to deal with the media, national governments and other humanitarian organizations. The head of mission does not necessarily have a medical background.
 Medical volunteers include physicians, surgeons, nurses, and various other specialists. In addition to operating the medical and nutrition components of the field mission, these volunteers are sometimes in charge of a group of local medical staff and provide training for them.
 Although the medical volunteers almost always receive the most media attention when the world becomes aware of an MSF field mission, there are a number of non-medical volunteers who help keep the field mission functioning. Logisticians are responsible for providing everything that the medical component of a mission needs, ranging from security and vehicle maintenance to food and electricity supplies. They may be engineers and/or foremen, but they usually also help with setting up treatment centres and supervising local staff. Other non-medical staff are water/sanitation specialists, who are usually experienced engineers in the fields of water treatment and management and financial/administration/human resources experts who are placed with field missions.
 Vaccination campaigns are a major part of the medical care provided during MSF missions. Diseases such as diphtheria, measles, meningitis, tetanus, pertussis, yellow fever, polio, and cholera, all of which are uncommon in developed countries, may be prevented with vaccination. Some of these diseases, such as cholera and measles, spread rapidly in large populations living in close proximity, such as in a refugee camp, and people must be immunised by the hundreds or thousands in a short period of time.[89] For example, in Beira, Mozambique in 2004, an experimental cholera vaccine was received twice by approximately 50,000 residents in about one month.[90]
 An equally important part of the medical care provided during MSF missions is AIDS treatment (with antiretroviral drugs), AIDS testing, and education. MSF is the only source of treatment for many countries in Africa, whose citizens make up the majority of people with HIV and AIDS worldwide.[54] Because antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) are not readily available, MSF usually provides treatment for opportunistic infections and educates the public on how to slow transmission of the disease.[91]
 In most countries, MSF increases the capabilities of local hospitals by improving sanitation, providing equipment and drugs, and training local hospital staff.[92] When the local staff is overwhelmed, MSF may open new specialised clinics for treatment of an endemic disease or surgery for victims of war. International staff start these clinics but MSF strives to increase the local staff's ability to run the clinics themselves through training and supervision.[93] In some countries, like Nicaragua, MSF provides public education to increase awareness of reproductive health care and venereal disease.[94]
 Since most of the areas that require field missions have been affected by a natural disaster, civil war, or endemic disease, the residents usually require psychological support as well. Although the presence of an MSF medical team may decrease stress somewhat among victims, often a team of psychologists or psychiatrists work with victims of depression, domestic violence and substance abuse. The doctors may also train local mental health staff.[95]
 Often in situations where an MSF mission is set up, there is moderate or severe malnutrition as a result of war, drought, or government economic mismanagement. Intentional starvation is also sometimes used during a war as a weapon, and MSF, in addition to providing food, brings awareness to the situation and insists on foreign government intervention. Infectious diseases and diarrhoea, both of which cause weight loss and weakening of a person's body (especially in children), must be treated with medication and proper nutrition to prevent further infections and weight loss. A combination of the above situations, as when a civil war is fought during times of drought and infectious disease outbreaks, can create famine.[96]
 In emergency situations where there is a lack of nutritious food, but not to the level of a true famine, protein-energy malnutrition is most common among young children. Marasmus, a form of calorie deficiency, is the most common form of childhood malnutrition and is characterised by severe wasting and often fatal weakening of the immune system. Kwashiorkor, a form of calorie and protein deficiency, is a more serious type of malnutrition in young children, and can negatively affect physical and mental development. Both types of malnutrition can make opportunistic infections fatal.[97] In these situations, MSF sets up Therapeutic Feeding Centres for monitoring the children and any other malnourished individuals.
 A Therapeutic Feeding Centre (or Therapeutic Feeding Programme) is designed to treat severe malnutrition through the gradual introduction of a special diet intended to promote weight gain after the individual has been treated for other health problems. The treatment programme is split between two phases:[98]
 MSF uses foods designed specifically for treatment of severe malnutrition. During phase 1, a type of therapeutic milk called F-75 is fed to patients. F-75 is a relatively low energy, low fat/protein milk powder that must be mixed with water and given to patients to prepare their bodies for phase 2.[99] During phase 2, therapeutic milk called F-100, which is higher in energy/fat/protein content than F-75, is given to patients, usually along with a peanut butter mixture called Plumpy'nut. F-100 and Plumpy'nut are designed to quickly provide large amounts of nutrients so that patients can be treated efficiently.[100][101] Other special food fed to populations in danger of starvation includes enriched flour and porridge, as well as a high protein biscuit called BP5. BP5 is a popular food for treating populations because it can be distributed easily and sent home with individuals, or it can be crushed and mixed with therapeutic milk for specific treatments.[102]
 Dehydration, sometimes due to diarrhoea or cholera, may also be present in a population, and MSF set up rehydration centres to combat this. A special solution called Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), which contains glucose and electrolytes, is given to patients to replace fluids lost. Antibiotics are also sometimes given to individuals with diarrhoea if it is known that they have cholera or dysentery.[103]
 Clean water is essential for hygiene, for consumption and for feeding programmes (for mixing with powdered therapeutic milk or porridge), as well as for preventing the spread of water-borne disease.[104] As such, MSF water engineers and volunteers must create a source of clean water. This is usually achieved by modifying an existing water well, by digging a new well and/or starting a water treatment project to obtain clean water for a population. Water treatment in these situations may consist of storage sedimentation, filtration and/or chlorination depending on available resources.[105]
 Sanitation is an essential part of field missions, and it may include education of local medical staff in proper sterilisation techniques, sewage treatment projects, proper waste disposal, and education of the population in personal hygiene. Proper wastewater treatment and water sanitation are the best way to prevent the spread of serious water-borne diseases, such as cholera.[106] Simple wastewater treatment systems can be set up by volunteers to protect drinking water from contamination.[107] Garbage disposal could include pits for normal waste and incineration for medical waste.[108] However, the most important subject in sanitation is the education of the local population, so that proper waste and water treatment can continue once MSF has left the area.
 In order to accurately report the conditions of a humanitarian emergency to the rest of the world and to governing bodies, data on a number of factors are collected during each field mission. The rate of malnutrition in children is used to determine the malnutrition rate in the population, and then to determine the need for feeding centres.[109] Various types of mortality rates are used to report the seriousness of a humanitarian emergency, and a common method used to measure mortality in a population is to have staff constantly monitoring the number of burials at cemeteries.[110] By compiling data on the frequency of diseases in hospitals, MSF can track the occurrence and location of epidemic increases (or ""seasons"") and stockpile vaccines and other drugs. For example, the ""Meningitis Belt"" (sub-Saharan Africa, which sees the most cases of meningitis in the world) has been ""mapped"" and the meningitis season occurs between December and June. Shifts in the location of the Belt and the timing of the season can be predicted using cumulative data over many years.[111]
 In addition to epidemiological surveys, MSF also uses population surveys to determine the rates of violence in various regions. By estimating the scopes of massacres, and determining the rate of kidnappings, rapes, and killings, psychosocial programmes can be implemented to lower the suicide rate and increase the sense of security in a population.[112] Large-scale forced migrations, excessive civilian casualties and massacres can be quantified using surveys, and MSF can use the results to put pressure on governments to provide help, or even expose genocide.[113] MSF conducted the first comprehensive mortality survey in Darfur in 2004.[114]
However, there may be ethical problems in collecting these statistics.[115][116]
 The Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines was initiated in 1999 to increase access to essential medicines in developing countries. ""Essential medicines"" are those drugs that are needed in sufficient supply to treat a disease common to a population.[117] However, most diseases common to populations in developing countries are no longer common to populations in developed countries; therefore, pharmaceutical companies find that producing these drugs is no longer profitable and may raise the price per treatment, decrease development of the drug (and new treatments) or even stop production of the drug. MSF often lacks effective drugs during field missions, and started the campaign to put pressure on governments and pharmaceutical companies to increase funding for essential medicines.
 In recent years, the organization has tried to use its influence to urge the drug maker Novartis to drop its case against India's patent law that prevents Novartis from patenting its drugs in India. A few years earlier, Novartis also sued South Africa to prevent it from importing cheaper AIDS drugs. Dr. Tido von Schoen-Angerer, director of DWB's Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines, says, ""Just like five years ago, Novartis, with its legal actions, is trying to stand in the way of people's right to access the medicines they need.""[118]
 On 1 April 2013, it was announced that the Indian court invalidated Novartis's patent on Gleevec. This decision makes the drug available via generics on the Indian market at a considerably lower price.[119]
 Aside from injuries and death associated with stray bullets, mines and epidemic disease, MSF volunteers are sometimes attacked or kidnapped for political reasons. In some countries afflicted by civil war, humanitarian-aid organizations are viewed as helping the enemy. If an aid mission is perceived to be exclusively set up for victims on one side of the conflict, it may come under attack for that reason. However, the War on Terrorism has generated attitudes among some groups in US-occupied countries that non-governmental aid organizations such as MSF are allied with or even work for the Coalition forces. Since the United States has labelled its operations ""humanitarian actions,"" independent aid organizations have been forced to defend their positions, or even evacuate their teams.[120] Insecurity in cities in Afghanistan and Iraq rose significantly following United States operations, and MSF has declared that providing aid in these countries was too dangerous.[121] The organization was forced to evacuate its teams from Afghanistan on 28 July 2004,[122] after five volunteers (Afghans Fasil Ahmad and Besmillah, Belgian Hélène de Beir, Norwegian Egil Tynæs, and Dutchman Willem Kwint) were killed on 2 June in an ambush by unidentified militia near Khair Khāna in Badghis Province.[123] In June 2007, Elsa Serfass, a volunteer with MSF-France, was killed[124] in the Central African Republic and in January 2008, two expatriate staff (Damien Lehalle and Victor Okumu) and a national staff member (Mohammed Bidhaan Ali) were killed in an organized attack[125] in Somalia resulting in the closing of the project.
 Arrests and abductions in politically unstable regions can also occur for volunteers, and in some cases, MSF field missions can be expelled entirely from a country. Arjan Erkel, Head of Mission in Dagestan in the North Caucasus, was kidnapped and held hostage in an unknown location by unknown abductors from 12 August 2002 until 11 April 2004. Paul Foreman, head of MSF-Holland, was arrested in Sudan in May 2005 for refusing to divulge documents used in compiling a report on rapes carried out by the pro-government Janjaweed militias (see Darfur conflict). Foreman cited the privacy of the women involved, and MSF alleged that the Sudanese government had arrested him because it disliked the bad publicity generated by the report.[126]
 On 14 August 2013, MSF announced that it was closing all of its programmes in Somalia due to attacks on its staff by Al-Shabaab militants and perceived indifference or inurement to this by the governmental authorities and wider society.[127]
 On 3 October 2015, 14 staff and 28 others died when an MSF hospital was bombed by American forces during the Battle of Kunduz.[128]
 On 27 October 2015, an MSF hospital in Sa'dah, Yemen was bombed by the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition.[129]
 On 28 November 2015, an MSF-supported hospital was barrel-bombed by a Syrian Air Force helicopter, killing seven and wounding forty-seven people near Homs, Syria.[130]
 On 10 January 2016, an MSF-supported hospital in Sa'dah was bombed by the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition, killing six people.[131]
 On 15 February 2016, two MSF-supported hospitals in Idlib District and Aleppo, Syria were bombed, killing at least 20 and injuring dozens of patients and medical personnel.[132][133] Both Russia and the United States denied responsibility and being in the area at the time.[134]
 On 28 April 2016, an MSF hospital in Aleppo was bombed, killing 50, including six staff and patients.[135]
 Living in Emergency is an award-winning documentary film by Mark N. Hopkins that tells the story of four MSF volunteer doctors confronting the challenges of medical work in war-torn areas of Liberia and Congo. It premiered at the 2008 Venice Film Festival and was theatrically released in the United States in 2010.
 The then president of MSF, James Orbinski, gave the Nobel Peace Prize speech on behalf of the organization.  In the opening, he discusses the conditions of the victims of the Rwandan genocide and focuses on one of his woman patients:[136]
 There were hundreds of women, children and men brought to the hospital that day, so many that we had to lay them out on the street and even operate on some of them there.  The gutters around the hospital ran red with blood.  The woman had not just been attacked with a machete, but her entire body rationally and systematically mutilated.  Her ears had been cut off.  And her face had been so carefully disfigured that a pattern was obvious in the slashes.  She was one among many—living an inhuman and simply indescribable suffering.  We could do little more for her at the moment than stop the bleeding with a few necessary sutures.  We were completely overwhelmed, and she knew that there were so many others.  She said to me in the clearest voice I have ever heard, 'Allez, allez…ummera, ummerasha'—'Go, go…my friend, find and let live your courage.' Orbinski affirmed the organization's commitment to publicizing the issues MSF encountered, stating[137]
 Silence has long been confused with neutrality, and has been presented as a necessary condition for humanitarian action. From its beginning, MSF was created in opposition to this assumption. We are not sure that words can always save lives, but we know that silence can certainly kill. MSF received 2015 Lasker-Bloomberg Public Service Award.[138]
 A number of other non-governmental organizations have adopted names ending in ""Sans Frontières"" or ""Without Borders"", inspired by Médecins Sans Frontières: for example, Engineers Without Borders, Payasos Sin Fronteras (Clowns Without Borders) and Reporters Without Borders."
Mercy Corps	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_Corps	"Mercy Corps is a global non-governmental, humanitarian aid organization operating in transitional contexts that have undergone, or have been undergoing, various forms of economic, environmental, social and political instabilities. The organization claims to have assisted more than 220 million people survive humanitarian conflicts, seek improvements in livelihoods, and deliver durable development to their communities.[3]
 Mercy Corps proposes a mission to ""alleviate suffering, poverty and oppression by helping people build secure, productive and just communities.""[4] Currently, the organization reports to be operating within 38 countries, including Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Myanmar and Somalia, with programs focused in a number of humanitarian sectors ranging from conflict management, children & youth to agriculture and food security.[5]
 Originally established as the Save the Refugee Fund in 1979 to provide first hand post-conflict relief after the Cambodian genocide under the Pol Pot regime, the organization has since expanded its mandate to deliver humanitarian assistance.[6] In 1982, the organization's founders, Ellsworth Culver and Dan O'Neill, chose the name of Mercy Corps to represent the broader international activities of the organization that has since been focusing on delivering durable, long-term solutions to a range of humanitarian and development issues.[7] The organization has been present in varying locations at different times - cumulatively, it reports to have delivered humanitarian assistance in 122 countries.[3]
 Mercy Corps delivered its first development program in Honduras in 1982. The program led to the establishment of the non-profit organization Project Global Village/Proyecto Aldea Global (PAG) in 1984 with a number of initiatives focused on development issues such as ""health & HIV/AIDS prevention, domestic violence, education, agro-industrial development, microcredits, environmental development & infrastructure.""[8][9] In the next decade following the formation of Mercy Corps, the organization would gradually expanded its mandates into the broader international arena, stationing in countries including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Jordan, Bosnia, Kosovo, North Korea, North Macedonia, China, Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Haiti.[7][10]
 Mercy Corps incorporated the Conflict Management Group founded by Roger Fisher in 2004. Three years later, it also moved to incorporate NetAid seeking to broaden its scope of youth engagement in fighting global poverty.
 Its programs have gradually gained structural and facilitating consistency throughout the course of the organization's development, ranging from long-term market system development programs, such as the Resilient Communities Program in Mongolia that would last until 2019, to short-term emergency response programs, such as the organization's post-disaster relief initiatives in Puerto-Rico after Hurricane Maria in the months following September 2017.[11][12]
 Throughout the course of Mercy Corps' history in its deliverance of humanitarian programs, the organization's focus in its overall operational strategies has seen substantial shifts. Starting as a non-government humanitarian aid organization specifically focused in the immediate humanitarian complexity of the refugee dilemma caused by the Cambodian genocide in 1979, the preceding incarnation of the organization, Save the Refugee Fund, focused on providing the means necessary to respond to first-hand emergencies of the grim implications of the genocide: short-term aids in food, water, shelter and other corresponding refugee assistance.[7]
 As Mercy Corps expanded its mandates and progressed into a large humanitarian aid organization with a notable international presence, it has also gradually transformed its main philanthropic focus from solely the deliverance of temporary assistance that contribute short-term impacts to the development of broader socio-economic infrastructures that encourage long-term improvements in the well-being of target beneficiaries. In a nutshell, Mercy Corps programs' main focus has transitioned from direct deliverance of emergency aid to long-term provision of assistance in improving community resilience.[13] Through a presentation published by USAID, Mercy Corps defines ""resilience"" as: ""The capacity of communities in complex socio-ecological systems to learn, cope, adapt, and transform in the face of shocks and stresses."" [14]
 To upkeep its new humanitarian focus on long-term community development, the phrase ""Market System Development"" has become one of the operational concepts of increasing importance for recent and upcoming Mercy Corps programs. Instead of focusing solely upon assisting one type of stakeholder within a community, the organization has dedicated increasing effort into engaging and all related actors and stakeholders in the complete market chain to participate in the improvement of the overall health of the targeted economic sector (agriculture, IT, pasture etc.) to eventually create a self-reliable operational market structure.[15]
 Mercy Corps International is the organization's main branch of operation. It focuses on resolving humanitarian and development challenges currently faced by societies in countries of unstable, transitional backgrounds. Mercy Corps International is commonly considered to be a leading organization in its field, contributing ""close to 94 percent of its resources to the most vulnerable areas in the world.""[16] With primary focuses on disaster relief and capacity building, the organization has also been integrating long-term civil society and human rights initiatives into their humanitarian programs, delivering notable funds and resources to target states of operation. The organization has been gradually expanding its general mandates, and they mainly revolve around 14 main objectives:[5]
 In 38 countries ranging from the Democratic Republic Congo, Haiti and Guatemala to Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Mongolia, Mercy Corps reportedly designs and delivers both temporary and long-term humanitarian assistance programs that are predominantly funded by other partnering international donor institutions. Some of the partnering donors include:[17]
 Mercy Corps accepts contributions from both individual and institutional donors. For instance, the organization received a combined operational grant of more than US$13 million from the United States Agency for International Development's 2016 Emergency Food Security Program in post-Ebola recovery in Liberia and conflict response in Yemen.[18]
 Mercy Corps Northwest operates domestically within the United States with focuses in primary economic development. It mainly aims to stimulate business growth opportunities for individuals and communities in the states of Oregon and Washington. Through different community development programs, Mercy Corps Northwest seeks to offer financial and technical assistance to low-income individuals to start a business, or small local business owners who experience financial hardships to overcome particular challenges, with the ultimate end-goal to enhance community-level economic capacity.[19] Some of the specific target populations include (but not restricted to):
 Mercy Corps Northwest targets several social fronts through a number of programs that deliver education, training and mentoring for prospective small business entrepreneurs. Its Community Investment Trust seeks to mobilize small community investments (ranging from US$10 to US$100) in selected commercial properties that are not only affordable venues for small businesses, but can also generate profit dividends for investors from local community in return.[20] The organization also establishes Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) and provides Small Business Grants of up to US$3000 through established IDAs for eligible families and individuals who complete specific sets of business training offered by the organization. The organization hosts a Women's Business Center that aims to empower start-up female entrepreneurs through training, microloan and grant provisions.[21] For former prisoners seeking re-integration into the community in Portland, Oregon, Mercy Corps Northwest also operates the Reentry Transition Center that offers joint business and social reentry training curricula that assist ex-offenders with managing independent and successful lives after being released from prison.[19]
 A number of Mercy Corps' agriculture-related programs are jointly delivered with objectives in other areas such as water conservation, disaster resilience, emergency crisis response and market system development. For example, Mercy Corps establishes partnerships with local farmers or agribusinesses to stimulate local market exchanges in Uganda, with the ultimate target to not only help farmers gain market competitiveness, but also make affordable food choices more accessible for local populations living in deprived conditions, including incoming refugees within Uganda and from neighboring countries in crisis.[22] In response to the food crisis of the mid-1990s and at the request of North Korea, Mercy Corps began their work in 1996 focusing in the areas of local agricultural development. Throughout the duration of its presence, Mercy Corps has moved from food assistance to working on long-term agricultural and economic solutions: apple trees and fish farms and cross-cultural exchange. The effort involves aid workers living in Pyongyang, and in Chagang and North Pyongan provinces to visit families, monitor distribution and assess impact.[23]
 Mercy Corps offers a number of agriculture-oriented programs in various countries, often delivered with water conservation and disaster prevention focuses. In Timor-Leste, for example, Mercy Corps seeks to build ""market-based incentives to mitigation activities"" so that local farmers are able to exercise different types of farming practices with different weather-resistance characteristics. By providing them with seed and farming assistance, these practices can enable Timorese farmers to contribute more ""nutritious food source to households and to local markets"" all the while diversifying farming practices so that ""communities are not so reliant on one or two key crops for income and nutrition.""[24] In Syria since 2011, it has been supporting an estimate of 9,000 local farmers and small gardeners by providing technical assistance in seasonal planting to mitigate with not only natural weather conditions but also man-made humanitarian crises on the ground. The organization purchases seeds for local farmers to reduce the investment cost of crop production in the post-Syrian war environment with destroyed infrastructure, and provide technical and business training that teach farmers efficient ways of planting and cultivation, as well as exchanging surplus productions in local markets.[25]
 Like most of its other development programs, Mercy Corps work to ""provide communities with the tools and support they need to transform their own lives to support resilient well-being."" With regards to food security, it targets five main areas for development: Pro-Poor Markets, Empowerment, Good Governance, Human Well-Being, and Economic Health.[26] It has been maintaining the main aim to providing its beneficiary population with necessary tools (both technical and material) and assisting them with utilizing these particular tools for the advancement of their own well-being.
 In Niger, Mercy Corps jointly delivered the ""Sawki"" Program with Africare and Helen Keller International.[27] The program, funded by USAID, aimed to respond to the food security needs of a reported 118,000 people in the most vulnerable regions of the country, including Maradi and Zinder. Understanding that 60% of the marginalized population in the program's target areas were children of severe malnutrition, the program sought to "" bring together complementary activities in nutrition, health, agriculture, livestock husbandry, livelihoods promotion, and market development,"" with an emphasized focal point on the empowerment of adolescent girls.[28]
 From 2009 to 2013, Mercy Corps has delivered a SECURE program in Timor-Leste that seeks to relieve and prevent agriculture related damages caused by extreme rainfalls by connecting local blacksmiths who are able to produce effective small and medium-sized metal silos to broader rural farming populations.  In collaboration with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Mercy Corps provided local farmers with subsidies for local farmers to purchase silos, while the FAO provided training and material assistance for blacksmiths to produce.[29][30]
 Mercy Corps has also been operating in post-conflict Uganda since 2009: as the state approaches societal recovery, it has been facing a range of development challenges, one of which being the production under-capacity of the farming sector. The Revitalizing Agricultural Incomes and New markets (RAIN) program was created to target key areas that are detrimental for long-term assurance of food security, including financial services for small and medium agro-businesses at the local level, advising larger food-related enterprises for agricultural investment opportunities at the regional and national level, and technical training for returning farmers at the individual level. In parallel of training programs for the farmer communities that seek to improve land-capacity, growth and cultivation capacity and production efficiency, Mercy Corps has also been facilitating various actors within the domestic market chain to promote better access and more extensive availability of financial services and market platforms to ensure the continuous operation of the agricultural supply and demand chains, with the broader objective to encourage sustainable food security.[31]
 Mercy Corps has been operating the PROSPECTS program in Liberia with the support of Exxon Mobil, the Coca Cola Africa Foundation and the Swedish Government. The program, at its third phase as of 2018, has been focused in improving livelihoods of close to 12,000 vulnerable Liberian youth by providing them pre-employment and entrepreneurial trainings, apprenticeships in 15 partnering host enterprises all the while stimulating overall local markets. It is expected that the program will be able to reach 19,000 youth from Bong, Nimba and Montserrado counties in Liberia with a range of skill training and cash grants to obtain employment or start small businesses.[32]
 In Gaza, Mercy Corps is attentive of the development of young entrepreneurs in the field of Information Technology by creating the working space Gaza Sky Geeks in 2011 with the support of a seed funding from Google, the Coca-Cola Foundation, Skoll and various local donors.[33] The particular initiative seeks to create a stage for new, young talents to grow and share their ideas while improving their skills through receiving professional mentoring and performing hands-on work. It also works to encourage female startup members within the IT community to engage in business and software engineering activities.[34] The Gaza Sky Geeks also provide considerable start-up grants for eligible young IT entrepreneurs to begin their businesses in the challenging market environment of Gaza. It hosts up to 140 people a day, with almost half of those hosted being women, with a prospective second location opening in the near future. Meanwhile, it has promoted local youth startups that receive significant attention from large U.S. technology firms such as Strips and Silicon Valley Bank.[35]
 Mercy Corps has been facilitating programs that deliver micro-financial services to individuals in different community contexts to promote long-term, self-sustainable economic growth. These particular programs offer small, short-term business loans to people of economically deprived conditions for them to start-up local businesses gain financial independence.
 Domestically within the United States, Mercy Corps Northwest partners with the AmeriCorps VISTA and offers small business loans and grants to help eligible individuals with jump-starting their own small enterprises.[36] Internationally, Mercy Corps offers microcredits to people living in transitional or developing contexts through its networks of affiliations with banking sectors across the globe.
 For example, in Indonesia and the Philippines, Mercy Corps announced the Maximizing Financial Access and Innovation at Scale (MAXIS) initiative that would the establishment of Bank Andara, a commercial bank that would partner with a broad network of microfinance institutions in the region to provide access to microfinancial services to, reportedly, 12 million Indonesian and 5 million Filipino nationals living in poverty through innovative strategies.[37][38] The MAXIS initiative, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2008, also provided financial and technical assistance that increased the operational capacity of Indonesia's Microfinance Innovations Center for Resources and Alternatives (MICRA) to provide extended means of assistance to 851 Indonesian poverty-focused microfinancial institutions. Mercy Corps also implemented similar actions in the Philippines to provide technical and research support to  other 359 Filipino microfinancial institutions that provide durable financial capacity-building services.[37][38]
 Another example would be the Asian Credit Fund in Kazakhstan, a microfinancial institution facilitated by Mercy Corps, was able to obtain an operational loan totaled in US$1.8 million from the Grameen Credit Agricole Foundation to deliver microfinancial services to people of deprived conditions individual micro-loans with terms of six months to one year, all the while providing education in financial literacy and environmental sustainability. The Asian Credit Fund is reported to have 37 offices, 21,000 borrowers of which 92% are female, and a US$8.7 million gross loan deliverance profile.[39]
 As of 2018, it is reported that Mercy Corps has distributed US$1.4 billion in forms of micro-loans to 244,315 clients globally.[40]
 Mercy Corps' SAFE (abbreviation of Supporting Adolescent Girls’ Future through Second Chance Education) School program in Niger ensures vital access for young adolescent girls to basic extents of education despite the nation's difficult socio-economic conditions. The program is a part of Mercy Corps' SAFE program series that, together, have the overall aim to improve the well-being of the female population in target areas. In collaboration with Niger's Ministry of Education and a local non-government organization, Organisation Nigerienne des Educateurs Novateurs, the SAFE School program sought to help ""adolescent girls from vulnerable households to enter or re-enter the education system."" Since its launch, it has engaged nearly 500 girls and 27 teachers (mostly female), as well as provided 20 learning centers with diversified management and teaching skills.[42]
 In Kailali, Nepal, Mercy Corps implemented the Education of Marginalized Girls in Kailali from 2013-2017. The program seeks to broaden the spectrum of education for local girls in far western Nepal through organizing girls' education hubs/clubs that encourage girls to continue their  education above the necessary education nationally established time frame (after obtaining the School Leaving Certificate), all the while persuading girls who have dropped out of their education to return to school. In addition, the program has also funded school curriculum in natural sciences, math, English and sexual health education to ensure the targeted adolescent girl population have extensive exposure to knowledge that are necessary for maintaining proper livelihoods.[43] Mercy Corps has also created two tool kits as one of the many elements of its deliverance of programs that encourage inclusive education for children with disabilities in Jordan, including various worksheets, plans, exercises and checklists to aid targeted disabled student populations with better managing their curriculum.[44]
 Mercy Corps has facilitated linkages between gender dimensions and positive aspects of long-term market development. In the United States, Mercy Corps Northwest facilitates the Women's Business Center that seeks to empower, grow and support female entrepreneurs in the state of Oregon by providing them with business training, discussion platform and operation grants/loans.[45]
 In Nigeria, the organization has recognized that a notable percentage of the adolescent girls want to start a small enterprise, of which most were already engaged in various extents of economic activity. Mercy Corps hence implemented the Adolescent Girls in Northern Nigeria: Financial Inclusion and Entrepreneurship Opportunities Profile program to identify key challenges and barriers for adolescent girls to initiate economic activities and gain a stable revenue to pay for their tuition and living expenses. Around 1800 adolescent girls have been profiled in Northern Nigeria.[46] These profiles would assist Mercy Corps and other related development organizations to facilitate future programs that aim to empower female to engage in entrepreneurial actions and contribute to the improvement of the market capacities of their own communities.
 In Afghanistan, Mercy Corps' INVEST program has had a meta-objective on developing durable market capacity of the Southern region of Helmand through introducing vocational education and skills training to local young Afghani population.[47] Funded by the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID), it is specifically designed for the particular demographics of the target region, and has provided specific technical training opportunities for nearly 22,000 young men and women, over 70% of which were able to find employment or self-employment in fields of tailoring, electric, mechanics and plumbing. INVEST's gender-neutral delivery has enabled a significant number of local women to gain a progressive amount of personal autonomy in patriarchal communities where they are still extensively marginalized, all the while contributed to the capacity-building of the overall Afghani market economy.[48][49]
 In Niger, where adolescent girls and women experience increasing exposures to gender-based violence in their communities, Mercy Corps have delivered the SAFE Space and later on, the SAFE Space + Livelihood programs that aims to provide safe platforms for young women and men to have access to accredited information on contraception, sexual health and family planning.[50] Over the life of these programs, Mercy Corps has worked with ""15 health care providers at community pharmacies and health centers to ensure that they have increased knowledge in family planning counselling and stock management to improve access to contraception.""[51]
 In North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mercy Corps delivers the Emergency Assistance to Conflict-Affected Populations (EACAP) program to provide first-hand emergency aid to internally displaced populations in the region created by related domestic instabilities. The program, at its second phase in 2012, operated with the main focuses on economic recovery and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) maintenance. Responding to the socio-political effects of the M23-related armed conflicts in Goma and broader North Kivu, Mercy Corps reached to assist a total of 122,769 internally-displaced populations to respond and mitigate existing instabilities.[52]
 Operating as part of the Better Than Cash Alliance in the Philippines, Mercy Corps sought to take advantage of existing financial technologies to meet the emergency financial needs for the surviving victims of the Haiyan Typhoon in the country. Rather than relying on the traditional physical cash-transfer methods, Mercy Corps partnered with the BPI Globe BanKO to offer a range of electronic financial services that can deliver emergency recover aid to typhoon survivors. Program beneficiaries were ""enrolled in BanKO’s mobile savings accounts, through which they received one to three separate electronic cash transfers totaling 3,950 Philippine Pesos (about $90).""[53] The beneficiaries are provided with a SIM telephone card and an ATM cash withdrawal card so that Mercy Corps can send important context-specific financial tips, advice, literacy information via both voice and SMS messages, while BanKO has the opportunity to reach directly to the beneficiaries through electronic banking means.

Nippon Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Foundation	"The Nippon Foundation (日本財団, Nipponzaidan) of Tokyo, Japan, is a private, non-profit grant-making organization. It was established in 1962 by Ryoichi Sasakawa, a late statesman and businessman. The foundation's mission is to direct Japanese motorboat racing revenue into philanthropic activities, and it uses these monies to pursue global maritime development and assistance for humanitarian work, both at home and abroad. In the humanitarian field, it focuses on such fields as social welfare, public health, and education.
 The current chairman is Yohei Sasakawa, World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination, Special Envoy of the Government of Japan for National Reconciliation in Myanmar, and the son of the foundation's founder, Ryoichi Sasakawa.
 In 1962, The Nippon Foundation was established under the auspices of the Japanese Motorboat Racing Law. The law and the foundation were initiatives of Ryoichi Sasakawa who, as chair, used them to both help rebuild the Japanese shipbuilding sector, and to conduct philanthropic activities around the world. This system of using gambling revenue to provide aid to needy sectors was a novel one in Japan at that time, and came under intense scrutiny. In response, the foundation strove for transparency[4] in conducting its activities, making its records publicly accessible from its earliest days.
 Initiatives pursued in this period include research for the development of super tankers and their engines, direct support for the shipbuilding industry, and the protection of safety in the Strait of Malacca—vital to Japan's national security, due to the fact that more than 80 percent of her oil passes this way.
 In the field of public welfare, the foundation pursued such youth-oriented initiatives as the building of sports facilities, the building of day care centers and the promotion of traffic safety education. In addition, it began donating mobile clinics and blood-mobiles, as well as constructing blood banks around the country.
 In the 1970s, the foundation continued to pursue its efforts to improve social services through such measures as the distribution of ambulances, training in the use of fire fighting equipment, the development of preventative measures for earthquakes and PR for the fire-fighting sector. It also donated medical ships to provide medical aid for people living on remote islands in Japan's inland sea.
 In 1971, it began its overseas work, and in 1974 established the Sasakawa Memorial Health Foundation[5] for the purpose of eliminating leprosy as a public health problem—an effort that has resulted in its elimination in all but 1 of the 122 countries where the disease was initially prevalent.[6]
 Support for the maritime world remained an important focus in the 1980s, building on the work of the previous decade. Examples of projects include ""Swift Wings"", which was a sail system designed for modern cargo ships, and research toward a ""Techno Superliner"", a 1,000-ton cargo vessel that could attain speeds of up to 50 knots.
 On the international cooperative support front, the foundation involved itself heavily in disaster relief, sending aid to help the victims of major disasters in countries around the world, and establishing the United Nations Sasakawa Award for Disaster Relief.[7]
 Health initiatives that began in this decade include the establishment of the WHO Sasakawa Health prize and a massive project to aid the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear power disaster, under which the foundation spent a total of more than US$50 million over ten years, screening over 200,000 children for thyroid cancer.[8]
 Up until 1988, the foundation went by the name the Japanese Shipbuilding Industry Foundation (JSIF), and even donated some supposedly $500,000 worth of fireworks to the Los Angeles 1984 Organizing Committee for use in those Olympics. It was much more than the LA Organizing Committee wanted to use, and they were forced to come up with a 25-minute fireworks show to accommodate the gift and NOT slight the Foundation.  Sometime around 1988–1989, the foundation dropped that moniker and went by several other names including the all-inclusive ""Nippon"" Foundation.
 In response to the Ethiopian famine of the mid-1980s, the foundation began a program of agricultural education throughout sub-Saharan Africa that eventually reached 14 countries, improving farmers’ yields by up to six times in some places.
 Finally, as a part of its human resources development program, the foundation created the Sasakawa Young Leaders’ Fellowship Fund,[9] a program that would eventually establish million-dollar funds at a total of 68 major universities around the world.
 In the 1990s, on the home front, the Nippon Foundation invested heavily in the elderly of Japan, pushing for the improvement of retirement homes, building model retirement homes, and helping the nation to develop its hospice system nearly from the ground up. Related to this field, the foundation also began donating specially equipped vehicles[10] to social welfare facilities and groups, enabling them to provide mobility services to the elderly and those with disability.
 The decade also saw one of Japan's worst earthquakes of the 20th century, and the disorganization of volunteer groups in the wake of the quake lead the foundation to put special attention on bringing these many groups together under one umbrella—the volunteer support center—a central body that coordinated volunteer effort in the event of a major disaster.
 In the maritime development field, the foundation began to turn its eye to the disparity in the level of training received by maritime experts in various countries. As a result, it provided funding for a scholarship for people from developing countries to attend the World Maritime University, in Malmö, Sweden. In perhaps an even broader effort, it created the International Association of Maritime Universities, uniting 50 institutions around the world, in an effort to standardize both the level of education and the materials used.
 The past years have seen the foundation continue to build on its work of the first four decades, working in the maritime, welfare and international cooperation fields.
 Since its origins, the foundation has been interested in aiding the nation's shipbuilding and maritime efforts, leading it to support both a display of a North Korean spy vessel that had been sunk by the Japanese Self Defense Forces, and a survey of Okinotori Island.
In addition, the foundation is providing support toward the establishment of a user-pays system to help the nations surrounding the Strait of Malacca in their efforts to both police the waters and maintain their environmental integrity.
 In international affairs, the foundation has most recently built more than 100 elementary schools in Myanmar and 100 in Cambodia. It has established a novel program to provide Mongolian nomadic families with boxes full of traditional medicines that can be replenished, at the cost only of those medicines used, a few times a year, when they come to market."

 Nobel's will expressed a request, to the surprise of many,[6] that his money be used for prizes in physics, chemistry, peace, physiology or medicine and literature.[7][8] Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last was written a little over a year before he died, and signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895.[9] Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31 million Swedish kronor, to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes.[10] (As of 2008 that equates to 186 million US dollars.)
 The capital shall be invested by my executors in safe securities and shall constitute a fund, the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind. The said interest shall be divided into five equal parts, which shall be apportioned as follows: one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics; one part to the person who shall have made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work of an idealistic tendency; and one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity among nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.
 The prizes for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical works by Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm; and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my expressed wish that in awarding the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the candidates, so that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be Scandinavian or not.
 The executors of his will were Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organize the prizes.[12] Although Nobel's will established the prizes, his plan was incomplete and, because of various other hurdles, it took five years before the Nobel Foundation could be established and the first prizes could be awarded on 10 December 1901 to, among others, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen.[6][13][14] As of 31 December 2015, the assets controlled by the Nobel Foundation amounted to 4.065 billion Swedish kronor (approx. US$443 million as of 12 December 2016).[5][15]
 The Nobel Foundation was founded as a private organisation on 29 June 1900 specifically to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes.[16] It is based on Nobel's last will and testament.[3] At the time Nobel's will led to much specticism and criticism and thus it was not until 26 April 1897 that his will was approved by the Storting.[17] Soon thereafter they appointed the members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that was to award the Peace Prize. Shortly after, the other prize-awarding organizations followed; Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June.[18][19] The next thing the Nobel Foundation did was to try to agree on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900 the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[6][12]
 In 1905 the Union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved which meant the responsibility for awarding Nobel Prizes was split between the two countries. Norway's Nobel Committee became the awarder of the Peace Prize while Sweden became the awarder of the other prizes.[12][17]
 In accordance with Nobel's will, the primary task of the Nobel Foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left after him in a fund.[5][12] Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to represent the Nobel Prize to the outside world and to take charge of informal activities and issues related to the awarding of the Nobel Prizes. The Nobel Foundation is not involved in any way in the process of selecting the Nobel laureates.[12][20] In many ways the Nobel Foundation is similar to an investment company in that it invests money in various ways to create a solid funding base for the prize and the administrative activities. The Nobel Foundation is exempt from all taxes in Sweden (since 1946) and from investment taxes in the United States (since 1953).[21] Since the 1980s the Foundation's investments began to earn more money than previously. At the beginning of the 1980s the award money was 1 million SEK but in 2008 the award money had increased to 10 million SEK.[17][22]
 According to the statutes the Foundation should consist of a Board with its seat in Stockholm. It should consist of five men. The Chairman of the board should be appointed by the King in Council.[23] The other four members should be appointed by the trustees of the prize awarding institutions. The Board's first task was to choose an executive director from among the board members. A deputy director should be appointed by the King in Council and two deputies for the other members were appointed by the Trustees. However, since 1995 all the members of the board have been chosen by the Trustees and the Executive Director and the deputy Director appointed by the board itself.[23]
 Apart from the board, the Nobel Foundation is made up by the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assembly, the Swedish Academy and the Norwegian Nobel Committee), the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions and auditors.[17][23]
 In 1965, the Foundation initiated the Nobel Symposia, a program that holds symposia ""devoted to areas of science where breakthroughs around the world are occurring or deal with other topics of primary cultural or social significance.""[24] The symposia has covered topics such as prostaglandins, chemical kinetics, diabetes mellitus, string theory, cosmology, and the Cold War in the 1980s.[25] The Nobel Symposium Committee consists of members from the Nobel Committees in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine; the Prize Committee for Economics; the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation; and the Wallenberg Foundation.[24]
 In 2007, the Nobel Charitable Trust, founded by Michael Nobel, Gustaf Nobel, Peter Nobel, and Philip Nobel, announced their plans to establish a new Nobel prize, the Michael Nobel Energy Award, that will award innovations in alternative energy technology. It will be the first new Nobel prize established by the Nobel family since Alfred Nobel established his prizes. However, it will be awarded by the Nobel Charitable Trust and not by the Nobel Foundation, although both are organisations founded by the Nobel family.[26][27]
 The plan was announced at nanoTX 07. The Nobel Foundation quickly reacted by threatening legal action for ""clear misuse of the reputation and goodwill of the Nobel Prize and the associations of integrity and eminence that has been created over time and through the efforts of the Nobel Committees"".[28] The Director, Michael Sohlman, of the Nobel Foundation and the elected head of the Nobel family disapproved to the institution of the so-called 'Dr. Michael Nobel Award' as well as the Nobel Charitable Trust (NCT) and Nobel Family Benevolent society.[29]
 After Nobel's death, the Nobel Foundation was set up to carry out the provisions of his will and to administer his funds. In his will, he had stipulated that four different institutions—three Swedish and one Norwegian—should award the prizes. From Stockholm, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences confers the prizes for physics, chemistry, and economics, the Karolinska Institute confers the prize for physiology or medicine, and the Swedish Academy confers the prize for literature. The Norwegian Nobel Committee based in Oslo confers the prize for peace. The Nobel Foundation is the legal owner and functional administrator of the funds and serves as the joint administrative body of the prize-awarding institutions, but it is not concerned with the prize deliberations or decisions, which rest exclusively with the four institutions.

 The NYRR Foundation was founded in 1998 to carry out the youth service mission of the New York Road Runners. NYRR Foundation’s goal is to promote health, well-being, and personal achievement among under-served children with little or no access to athletic programming. Various programs are all designed to help youth of all sizes, fitness levels and athletic talents utilize the discipline of running to improve health, build character and uplift the spirit. In 2007, NYRR Foundation programs serve more than 20,000 kids per week from over 150 schools and community centers participating in NYRR Foundation programs in New York City and across the country.
 The club gives out the Abebe Bikila Award annually in recognition of individuals who have contributed to the sport of running. First awarded in 1978 and named in honor of Olympic marathon winner Abebe Bikila, the award is presented in November immediately before the start of NYRR's International Friendship Run.
 Founded by Deborah Marie King (1947–2000), the Central Park Safety Program is a New York City Official Civilian Observation Patrol Program. Volunteers are trained and patrol in pairs, each wearing an orange vest and equipped with a radio that is linked to the NYPD’s 19th Precinct.  According to Ms. King, ""if we wish to move freely and safely, we should share responsibility with the police, the park’s personnel, and each other. This comprehensive safety program represents community crime prevention at its very best.” Safety Program pairs patrol weekdays from 6:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., and Saturdays and Sundays from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
 NYRR conducts free guided group walks through Central Park of up to 3 miles, starting at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays via the Striders program. Groups meet at the NYRR Information Kiosk.

Oaktree	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaktree_(foundation)	"Oaktree is an Australian-based, non-government organisation that specialises in international youth development. Their mission is to lead, demand and create a more just world. Founded in 2003, the organisation is run by young people aged 16 to 26, and overseen by an advisory board.
 Oaktree collaborates with like-minded youth partners in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and India. Together, they grow the capability and influence of young people across their region.
 In Australia, Oaktree focuses on advocating for the value of youth voices. Their community-driven campaigns connect young Australian voices to decision-makers to influence policy change on issues of justice, like Australian aid.
 Oaktree was founded in Melbourne by Hugh Evans and Nicolas Mackay in 2003. After winning a World Vision contest to visit development programs in the Philippines, aged 13 years, Evans went on  exchange to Woodstock School in the Himalayas in India two years later. A further trip to the rural valley communities of the KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa, where he volunteered with World Vision, saw him return to Melbourne in 2003 and join with Mackay and other young people to establish Oaktree, with the purpose of combating some of the inequalities that Evans had witnessed.[1] In October 2013, Oaktree launched a new brand and website to mark its 10th birthday.
 Oaktree has invested over A$2.5 million into aid development projects between 2003 and 2012.[5][self-published source?]
 The mission statement of Oaktree as of 2018 is ""Oaktree is young people leading, demanding and creating a more just world."" Oaktree aspires to achieve its mission in three ways:[6][self-published source?]
 As of October 2013, Oaktree has an office in every Australian state and in the Australian Capital Territory. With 125,000 supporters and 350 volunteer staff as at 31 December 2011, Oaktree generated A$1.76 million in revenue.[6][7]
 Oaktree supports the following international aid and development:[6]
 Oaktree runs educational programs that aim to transform Australians into dedicated and effective agents of change in acting on extreme poverty.
 Live Below the Line, run in partnership between Oaktree and the Global Poverty Project, is a 5-day extreme poverty awareness and fundraising campaign. The campaign encourages members of the general public in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom to participate in order to develop a better understanding of the daily challenges faced by the 1.4 billion people experiencing extreme poverty. For each of the five days of the campaign the participants are encouraged to limit their food expenditure to the equivalent of the extreme poverty line, set at US$1.25. The participants use their daily experiences to bring extreme poverty to the awareness of others.[7] During 2011, this program generated A$1.4 million from 6,518 participants.
 Other smaller programs include Generate and Schools 4 Schools focused on advocacy and peer-to-peer education respectively.
 In 2009, Oaktree claimed that, together with World Vision and other advocacy groups, their advocacy via the End Child Slavery campaign contributed to an announcement by Cadbury Australia that it will change its milk chocolate range to fair trade sources.[8]
 The Make Poverty History Concert was the brainchild of Daniel Adams from the Oaktree Foundation. He, along with Hugh Evans, John Connor (formally of World Vision), Emeli Paulo of The Reach Foundation and a team of volunteers from the Oaktree Foundation organised the event on behalf of the Make Poverty History Coalition in Australia.[citation needed] Small performances were also held in the regional Victorian cities of Geelong and Ballarat.[citation needed] The purpose of the Make Poverty History Concert was to generate wide public support for the Make Poverty History campaign. Another aim of the concert was to encourage the G20 to make policies that are equitable for developing countries.[citation needed]
 The concert was held on the night of 17 November 2006 produced by Dan Adams, Hugh Evans, Emeli Paulo and John Connor at Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne, Australia. The concert was timed to coincide with the G20 Summit which was being hosted by then-Australian Treasurer, Peter Costello. The aim of the event was to create public awareness of preventable poverty and to get the message to members of the G20 summit that ""more financial aid should be given to poorer nations"". The concert was free to attend, as the focus of the concert was not to raise money, but to raise awareness amongst the Australian public, particularly the younger generation.[citation needed]"

Operation Blessing International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Blessing_International	"Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation (OB) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) humanitarian organization founded in the United States. Beginning in 1978, OBI has worked in more than 90 countries and every state. Implementing programs that provide disaster relief, medical aid, clean water, hunger relief, community development and orphan care, Operation Blessing is governed by a national board of directors.
 Founded on November 14, 1978 by businessman, televangelist, and philanthropist Pat Robertson, Operation Blessing was originally set up to help struggling individuals and families by match ing their needs for items such as clothing, appliances, and vehicles with donated items from viewers of The 700 Club, Robertson's daily television program. Coordinating with local churches and other organizations, OBI expanded their matching funds program to also include food provisions and financial assistance for low-income families. In 1990, Operation Blessing began moving from individual assistance to helping fund outreach centers across the U.S. who provide a broad, community impact through their partnerships with local ministries, food pantries, and shelters. Internationally, OBI continued to expand its medical, hunger and disaster relief efforts and, in 1986, Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation was officially incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.[2]
 According to the organization's official website, Operation Blessing's mission statement is ""...to demonstrate God's love by alleviating human need and suffering in the United States and around the world.""[3] Operation Blessing operates on an ongoing basis in dozens of countries around the world, implementing programs that provide strategic disaster relief, medical aid, hunger relief, clean water and community development.[4]
 Specializing in disaster relief, Operation Blessing has most recently been involved in domestic relief work for victims of severe flooding in Nebraska, tornadoes in Alabama, and Hurricanes Michael and Florence in Florida and North Carolina. Internationally, Operation Blessing is helping victims of the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and Cyclone Idai victims in East Africa. 
 In the wake of a devastating outbreak of the Zika virus in Latin America and the Caribbean, Operation Blessing employed juvenile turtles, fish and copepods to eat mosquito larvae before the insects can spread the virus.[5] Operation Blessing is also fighting the spread of Zika through education, mosquito nets and insect repellent to protect the most vulnerable, especially pregnant women and their unborn children.[6]
 Operation Blessing also provided relief during the April 2015 Nepal earthquake,[7] 2014 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa,[8] and following the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the 2013 Moore tornado in Oklahoma and the tornado outbreak of November 17, 2013 in Illinois, Hurricanes Sandy and Isaac, the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami;[9] the 2011 Horn of Africa famine; 2011 tornadoes in Virginia, Alabama, and Missouri; the 2010-2011 Haiti cholera outbreak;[10] and the 2010 Haiti earthquake.
 Additionally, Operation Blessing funded relief and recovery efforts in response to war torn Iraq, Syria, Israel, South Sudan, Mali, Somalia,[11] and Lebanon;[12]
 Previously, Operation Blessing also aided disaster victims in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake (Indonesian tsunami),[13] as well as recovery efforts in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina;[14][15] and the Niger food crisis.[16]
 Internationally, Operation Blessing medical teams offer free medical care (general medical, optical, dental and surgical services) and medicine to impoverished families, many of whom cannot afford such treatment or live in rural areas without regular access to health clinics. They are also developing teams of community health workers to help prevent and detect illnesses and diseases in rural villages as well as conduct insecticide-treated bed net distributions for children and pregnant women to reduce the risk of being bitten by malaria-carrying mosquitoes.[17]
 Operation Blessing teams drill water wells in impoverished communities to provide villagers with an accessible clean water source, preventing many water-borne diseases and reducing the amount of time women and children spend collecting water. In high altitude areas where wells are not an option, cisterns installed by Operation Blessing collect and store rainwater. Operation Blessing also installs large water purification systems that purify up to 10,000 gallons of water a day, often used during disasters or for high volume areas like hospitals.[18]
 Operation Blessing also manufactures chlorine to disinfect water supplies for hospitals, including the largest hospital in Juba, South Sudan, and Mirebalais Hospital in Haiti. Additional chlorine production is aiding the effort to fight Ebola in Liberia. In several developing countries, Operation Blessing distributes PackH2O water backpacks, installs rural community water systems, and even uses desalination technology to turn seawater into drinking water.
 In the United States, Operation Blessing's Hunger Strike Force trucks deliver an average of almost 2 million pounds of food and product each week to local ministries, food pantries, shelters, and more across America.[19] Internationally, Operation Blessing's food distributions are helping to fight hunger and reduce malnutrition by providing emergency food relief to children and families in crisis. Further, food security efforts like grain banks, agriculture training, and fish farms are working to establish long-term hunger relief in areas affected by drought, famine and poverty.[20]
 Microenterprise projects and loans are helping to equip men and women with marketable job skills and the resources needed to open small businesses in countries like Honduras, the Philippines, Peru and India. Skills training courses in electrical work and baking, as well as community development initiatives such as vegetable gardens and sewing centers are helping to improve the living conditions of impoverished families and develop stronger communities.[21]
 Operation Blessing's Bless-A-Child programs provide nutrition, education, medical care, and more for vulnerable children while also aiding HIV/AIDS orphans, street children living in poverty, and those rescued from child trafficking.[22]
 Operation Blessing partners with numerous other organizations and nonprofits, including Mayo Clinic of Minnesota, International Justice Mission, Free Wheelchair Mission, and Tide Loads of Hope. OBI also conducted annual food distributions with professional sports teams such as the Kansas City Chiefs, Kansas City Royals,[23] Washington Redskins, and Jacksonville Jaguars.[1]
 Operation Blessing is a member of the Association of Evangelical Relief and Development Organizations (AERDO)[24] and is registered with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)[25] and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).[26] OBI is also a national member of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD), Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), Christian Service Charities, Christian Service Organizations of America (CSOA), the Global Compassion Network, the Virginia Trucking Association, and the American Trucking Associations (ATA).[27]
 Operation Blessing is a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA), and is audited annually by KPMG, LLP.
 After making emotional pleas in 1994 on The 700 Club for cash donations to Operation Blessing to support airlifts of refugees from Rwanda to Zaire, it was later discovered, by a reporter from The Virginian-Pilot, that Operation Blessing's planes were transporting diamond-mining equipment for the Robertson-owned African Development Corporation, a venture Robertson had established in cooperation with Zaire's dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, whom Robertson had befriended earlier in 1993.[28][29] According to Operation Blessing documents, Robertson personally owned the planes used for Operation Blessing airlifts.[30]
 Robertson continues to state that Operation Blessing was largely responsible for providing aid to Rwanda following the 1994 genocide, even after an official investigation into Operation Blessing described it as a ""fraudulent and deceptive"" operation that provided almost no aid.[citation needed] A September 2013 article in The Guardian stated that all Operation Blessing volunteers did was recite Bible passages at dying refugees. Robertson was accused of taking credit for work that was actually done by Médecins Sans Frontières.[28]
 In December 2013, The Guardian issued an apology to Operation Blessing, retracting many of their accusations, acknowledging that they had not mentioned a further report that cleared Operation Blessing of any wrongdoing, and agreeing to make a donation to Operation Blessing's ""relief efforts for victims of the typhoon in the Philippines.""[31] A 1999 report concluded that, whilst Robertson's request for donations to Operation Blessing had been misleading, they were not an intentional attempt to commit fraud.[32]"
Operation Smile	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Smile	"Operation Smile is a nonprofit medical service organization founded in 1982 by Dr. William P. Magee, Jr. and his wife Kathy Magee. It is headquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
 In addition to providing cleft lip and palate repair surgeries to children worldwide, Operation Smile works as a non-governmental organization to reduce the occurrence of cleft lips and palates worldwide; develops ambassadorships to raise awareness of cleft issues; sponsors a world care program for international cases requiring special care; organizes foundations worldwide to assist countries in reaching self-sufficiency with cleft surgeries; hosts a U.S. care network to assist families in the U.S. with cleft issues and  develops and administers worldwide education programs related to cleft issues; and organizes student leadership programs.
 Operation Smile has provided over 220,000 free surgeries for children and young adults born with cleft lips, cleft palates, and other facial deformities in over 60 countries since 1982.[1] As of 2018, Operation Smile provided on-going care around the world at 34 smile centers.[2] According to its own tax report, Operation Smile completed 156 medical missions in 80 sites around the world, including 13 new sites in some of the poorest regions of the world - and provided free surgical care for over 12,000 children and adults. [2] During missions, over 35,000 dental procedures were performed in the year 2018. [2]
 Operation Smile was founded by Bill and Kathy Magee (Dr. William P. Magee Jr., D.D.S., M.D. and Kathleen S. Magee, B.S.N., M.Ed., M.S.W.). In 1982 Dr. Magee, a plastic surgeon, and Kathy Magee, who was then a social worker and a nurse, were invited to join a Philippine cleft repair mission with a group of medical volunteers.[3][4] When they realized that this group would not be returning to the Philippines even though there were hundreds of children who needed surgery, they established Operation Smile. Dr. Magee said,[3]
 It was guilt ... We saw hundreds of children and saw many more turned away. We knew that this group was not planning to return. So we planned another trip, but when we saw how many people were suffering because of their facial deformities, we had to keep on going back. You can't help but be touched by things that we take as completely normal and all of a sudden become a monumental event in a child's life.
 The Magee's kept their promise and completed two trips back to Naga City, which resulted in treating 400 children.[5] The scope of the organization increased after Mother Teresa invited Operation Smile to come to India to treat deformed children.[6] In 1987, Operation Smile launched the Physicians’ Program, which brought doctors from the countries in which Operation Smile conducted medical missions to Norfolk, Virginia, to train with Co-Founder Dr. Bill Magee. That same year Operation Smile completed its First medical mission to Kenya. [5] Within the next two years, Operation Smile received a Presidential Citation for Private Sector Initiatives from President Ronald Reagan, and was adopted as a service project by the General Federation of Women’s Clubs. [5] In 1995, Operation Smile opened its first care center, offering patients cleft treatments year-round, in Duitama, Colombia. After establishing the Global Headquarters location in Norfolk, VA, Operation Smile began foundations in different countries like Australia, UK, Italy, Vietnam, and Ireland. [5]
 Dr. Magee is currently employed as the Chief Executive Officer of Operation Smile and is a faculty member of both the Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters and Eastern Virginia Medical School. His wife, Kathy Magee, serves as the president on a full-time, volunteer basis and is a lifetime member of the Board of Directors.
 Operation Smile organizes international volunteer missions to provide cleft lip and cleft palate repair in developing countries, coordinates programs for training physicians from around the world, manages programs to assist host countries in reaching cleft lip and cleft palate repair self-sufficiency, supports education and research programs to eradicate cleft lips and palates, and organizes global volunteer programs for high-school and college students.
 For each mission, Operation Smile verifies the credentials and organizes the participation and travel arrangements for a team of volunteers.[7] The team typically includes a mission site coordinator, plastic surgeons, anesthesiologists, a pediatrician, an intensive care physician, head or coordinating nurse, pre- and post-op nurses, child development specialists, speech pathologists,[8] dentists and/or orthodontists.
 Teams work with local volunteers from the host nation as well as from other nations. Many of the volunteers provide important logistical (non-medical) support to the mission; they may serve as translators, medical records technicians, photographers, or help in such areas as food services, lodging, procurement of supplies, or transportation. The teams also typically include two high school students who fulfill various functions, including giving presentations on health maintenance and dental hygiene to families living near the mission site. Operation Smile coordinates the donation, purchase and delivery of medical provisions (equipment, medications, supplies) for each mission.
 During the fiscal year of 2018, Operation Smile hosted 156 medical missions in 80 unique sites around the world and provided free surgical care for over 12,00 children and young adults. Nearly 82% of medical professionals volunteering with Operation Smile were from low and middle income countries. The medical volunteers provided approximately 397,312 hours of free care for Operation Smile's patients. [2]
 Operation Smile's partner countries include:
 Patients with conditions too serious to treat in their own countries can become World Care patients and come to the United States.[23] On a case by case basis, Operation Smile will bring extraordinary craniofacial cases to Norfolk, Virginia, and all around the U.S. when mission conditions are inappropriate for the severity of the case. As of June 2007, approximately 200 world care patients had been treated.[24]
 Operation Smile has in-country global foundations that raise funds and awareness to support its programs. Mission teams are hosted by international foundations that are responsible for all in-country mission logistics and raise funds and awareness throughout the year. [2]  Through partnerships with the American Heart Association, as well as with medical and teaching institutions, healthcare professionals from developing countries receive evidence based education, and hands on training and mentoring. Operation smile also has sponsored conferences, seminar workshops, rotation programs, visiting professorships, and short and long term fellowships. [2]
 To aid countries in becoming self-sufficient at caring for cleft patients, beginning in early 2007 the organization planned to open comprehensive care medical clinics in Colombia, Honduras, Morocco, China, India, the Philippines and Vietnam.[25] The centers provide surgeries and treatment, educate local volunteers, perform local development activities and manage local communications / administrative services. The center in Vietnam expected to treat 2,000 patients annually and to train about 1,000 medical professionals.[25] As of 2018, Operation Smile now offers over 30 comprehensive care clinics around the world. [2]
 Operation Smile provides a network of resources to assist families in the U.S. with children born with facial deformities. This network is accessed through the Operation Smile website and includes a listing of referral websites and a physicians resource list with the names of doctors available to review a case.
 Operation Smile provides a framework for its partner countries to come together to share knowledge, technology and skills through the use of programs customized to each country's specific medical infrastructure. University partnerships offer Operation Smile medical volunteers training in advanced techniques and provide opportunities including fellowships, emeritus professorships and visiting professorship programs. Education exchange programs are also offered through partnerships with leading medical teaching institutions.
 The annual Operation Smile Physicians' Training Program (PTP) brings surgeons from around the world to the United States for training in specialized surgical skills. The program has helped train more than 650 international physicians in advanced craniofacial techniques.[26]
 Operation Smile has hosted two global summits on medical standards in Norfolk, Virginia.[27][28] Operation Smile attempts to hold yearly summits to offer medical training and advancement for medical workers around the globe. In 2017, they partnered with St. Luke's Medical Center in the Philippines to offer medically-focused skills workshops to its participants. [29]
 Operation Smile student programs encourages students to lead clubs and raise awareness of health in other countries.[30] Operation Smile engages students from around the world through an annual International Student Leadership Conference (ISLC) which convenes high school freshmen, sophomores and juniors who want to make a difference in global health. The International Student Leadership Conference (ISLC) is a big aspect of the Operation Smile student programs. Once every year, 500-700 students from around the world meet to discuss the world's issues and how to solve them with a specific focus on medical care equity. In 2018, the ISLC that took place in Seattle, WA included more than 300 students from across the globe, including China, Vietnam, Ireland, Panama, South Africa and Canada that learned how to advocate for children born with a cleft lip, cleft palate or other facial deformity. During the conference, students also learned about global health, joined in peer-to-peer leadership training and participated in service projects to benefit Operation Smile patients, as well as staff at Seattle Children’s Hospital. [31]
 Operation Smile also offers students to travel internationally once they have experience. Before the students go on a mission, they must apply and be selected to attend the Mission Training Workshop (MTW), which is held twice a year. At MTW students are taught four health modules: dental hygiene, oral re-hydration therapy, nutrition, and burn care and prevention. Students make posters for each of these modules and present them on the missions, delivering critical information teaching families simple things that can save lives. While spending time at OpSmile headquarters in Virginia Beach, they will be trained as Operation Smile ambassadors in developing countries. Upon completion of this training they will be selected for an international mission. [30]
 Since Operation Smile’s founding in 1982, delivering safe surgery to people living with cleft conditions in low-resource settings around the world has been – and will continue to be – its driving force. Operation Smile is applying its expertise in treating cleft conditions to create sustainable solutions that will bring safe and essential surgery to people where it’s needed most. In rural northeastern Nicaragua, this life-saving work is already underway through a pilot project called Cirugía para el Pueblo – “Surgery for the People.” Operation Smile and the Ministry of Health seek to improve the surgical infrastructure of the hospitals and to spread awareness about surgically-treatable conditions to the people of the region. [32] The project will provide places like Nicaragua with education and awareness of common surgical diseases. These manuals will be used at the local health clinics in the remote villages, so people will be able to understand that their condition can be cured by surgery. Another part of this project is to provide needed equipment supplies and possible solutions to the lack of human resources, space to operate, and overall clean water. 
 Operation Smile is also working toward safe surgical conditions in Ethiopia and Rwanda. The organization offers surgical training rotations in Ethiopia and Rwanda. They've been conducting these educational rotations, which train general surgeons skills in reconstructive plastic surgery techniques, since 2012 in Ethiopia and since 2015 in Rwanda. [33]  The two-week training courses for Ethiopian surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses take place at JUSH (Jimma University Specialized Hospital), the only hospital serving the 15 million-plus people living in Ethiopia’s southwestern region. The focus of the rotations isn’t only on cleft surgery, but also teaching general surgeons a wide range of techniques to better heal burn, trauma and surgical wounds, which represent the bulk of the hospital’s need for plastic surgery. [33]
 Starting in 2015, Operation Smile partnered with the University of Rwanda, Partners In Health and the Rwandan Ministry of Health to host twice-annual surgical training rotations.[34] Since then, 17 Rwandan general surgery residents have received hands-on training and education through the rotations. Operation Smile has also been working to improve the skills of anesthesiologists, which is an apparent need in Rwanda. Through a grant secured by Operation Smile Sweden through the Swedish Postcode Lottery, Operation Smile will help establish the country’s first-ever postgraduate reconstructive plastic surgery certification program in partnership with the University of Rwanda and Rwanda’s ministries of education and health. The program is scheduled to begin in September 2019 with its first graduates receiving certifications in 2022.[34]
 On April 2nd, 2019 in the Vietnam Ministry of Health hosted a conference on patient safety and surgical safety that involved Operation Smile's participation. The achievement of collaboration between the Medical Services Administration of Vietnam MoH and Operation Smile comes after a Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 2014 with a goal to increase access to quality standards for safe surgery in Vietnam [35] During the recent conference, Operation Smile worked with the MoH, World Health Organization, and other organizations, to implement the set of eight Quality Standards for Safe Surgery. [36] The project started with the assessment of current surgical capacity in the country and included hospitals representing all socio-economic zones in Vietnam. The assessment results served as the baseline information for specialists to develop appropriate and feasible safe surgery standards for Vietnam. The drafting team used WHOs' document ""Safe Surgery Saves Lives,"" as well as Operation Smile's Global Standards of Care as references for development of the Standards. The adoption of Safe Surgery Standards will have potential to impact three million surgeries annually throughout Vietnam.[36]
 In 1996, Operation Smile was the first recipient of the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize.[37] In 1997, Dr. Bill Magee and Kathy Magee receive the Servitor Pacis Award from The Path to Peace Foundation.[38][39] In 1999, Kathleen Magee was awarded the World of Children Award for her contributions to helping vulnerable children through her efforts with Operation Smile.[40]
Dr. Magee received the 2001 Antonio Feltrinelli Prize (Premi ""Antonio Feltrinelli"") awarded by the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, which represents the National Academy of Science in Italy, for Exceptional Endeavors of Outstanding Moral and Humanitarian Value.[41] Dr. Magee presented the[when?]Honorary Kazanjian Lecture to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, and in 1998 received the Distinguished Service Award from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.[26]  Kathleen Magee received the 1997 Servants of Peace Award from the U.N. Representative to the Vatican.[42]
 In November 1999, specific patient deaths[47] brought criticism on Operation Smile's medical procedures, suggesting the organization prioritized publicity and volume over patient welfare and safety.[48][49] In response, Operation Smile conducted an internal review. Initially, the organization ""promised to make public the full findings of the review"",[citation needed] though later chose not to release the findings, considering the review an internal matter. Several directors disagreed with this choice and left the board. Four months after announcing the review, the organization publicly acknowledged organizational flaws.[50] By 2002, the organization also established medical credential standards, improved medical monitoring of patients, and implemented quality and financial controls.[51]
 Film producer, director, producer, and author Perry Moore (The Chronicles of Narnia, Executive Producer; author of the LAMBDA award-winning HERO) was a student volunteer in 1988 and, trained as a scrub and health care advisor. He was part of the team that traveled to Manila, and then to Naga City in the Philippines.
 Operation Smile announced in late 2007 that it would relocate its world headquarters approximately 16 miles (26 km) from its location in Norfolk, Virginia to a new building in Virginia Beach.[79] The projected 65,000-square-foot (6,000 m2) building is sited adjacent to a projected regional health profession center to be built by Tidewater Community College. The headquarters occupies land owned by the city of Virginia Beach and received funds from the city for site improvements, including landscaping, utility service and sidewalks.
 As of May 2014, the Operation Smile website listed the new address at 3641 Faculty Boulevard, Virginia Beach as its headquarters."
Operation USA	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_USA	"Operation USA (also known as OpUSA, Operation California, or OpCal) is a non profit humanitarian organization dedicated to helping communities alleviate the effects of disaster, disease, and endemic poverty throughout the world by providing privately funded relief, reconstruction, humanitarian aid and development aid. It is exclusively privately funded, receiving no assistance from the United States federal government. OPUSA had a revenue of over $22 million in fiscal year 2012 and has shipped over $425 million worth of ""high-priority medical, nutritional and shelter supplies"" since its inception, including shipments to Haiti, Japan, Chile, Kenya and Pakistan in 2011 and 2011.[1][2]
 Operation USA was part of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines in 1997 when it won the Nobel Peace Prize.[3][4] Operation California was also the winner of the 1983 President's Volunteer Action Award.[4] Operation USA has been named one of America's Best 100 Charities by Worth Magazine[5]  and, in October 2008, was named the top-rated ""exclusively privately funded charity in the U.S."" [6] by Charity Navigator. Operation USA collaborated with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the US National Laboratories at Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos to develop new approaches to land mine detection,[7] is a member of InterAction,[5] and is an AlertNet news partner.[8] In 2014 Operation USA's CEO Richard M. Walden received the Honeywell Hometown Hero Award from the Honeywell Corp.
 Operation California began in 1979 as ""a relief organization created to provide aid to Vietnamese Boat People and Cambodian refugees"",[9] co-founded by Richard Walden (still active as President & CEO) and Llewellyn Werner (who left in early 1980). The organization flew ""the first international relief airlift to Cambodia since 1975"",[10] delivering medicine to Phnom-Penh. Operation California had airlifted more than $3 million worth of aid by October 1979.[11][12][13][14]
 Since then, Operation USA has become a highly acclaimed aid organization that is involved in helping people in different ways around the world. In 1982, Operation California sent ""the first private airlift from the U.S. to Poland"", delivering 200,000 lbs. of medical supplies and medicine;[15] that year Operation California also airlifted medical supplies to Lebanon.[16] In 1983, Operation California delivered aid to the children of Vietnam and Cambodia.[17] Operation California provided aid to the earthquake victims in Mexico City in 1985,[18] as well as working in cooperation with the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee and Oxfam America, to deliver $250,000 worth of medical aid to Nicaragua.[19][20] In 1986 Operation California, in conjunction with Medical Aid to El Salvador, sent ""[t]wo cargo planes carrying $500,000 worth of relief supplies to earthquake-stricken El Salvador"".[21]
 In 1988, Operation California began using the name Operation USA because it better described the effort and intent of the organization to represent the entire American people.[10] In 1989 Operation USA facilitated operations on children in Vietnam who had cleft palates by a Los Angeles-based plastic surgeon, Dr Stanley Frileck.[22] Medical aid and rebuilding effort was delivered to Mexico in 1990, by OPUSA.[23] In 1991 OPUSA delivered aid to Bangladesh.[24] OpUSA delivered aid to war torn Somali's in 1993.[25] In 1994 OpUSA provided earthquake relief.[26] In 1995 the organization provided aid to Hurricane Mitch survivors in Honduras and Nicaragua.[27] In 1999 OpUSA supplied aid to storm victims in Mexico.[28] In 2003 OpUSA delivered aid to Iraq War victims in the Persian Gulf.[29] The tsunami victims in Sri Lanka and Indonesia were aided by OpUSA in 2004,[30] as well as the Mexico City Flood victims.[18]
 In 2008, OpUSA has delivered aid to Myanmar cyclone victims[31] as well as Chinese earthquake victims[32] and flood victims in the Midwest, USA.[33]
 In 2015, OpUsa partners with UniversalGiving to raise funds for its project, which is to deliver recovery aid to Nepal earthquake victims and rebuild schools.
 Operation USA, since the early 1980s, has relied on fundraising efforts featuring singers and celebrities. These include concerts, dinners, and other events. These promotions have featured: 
 Rosario Dawson travelled with Operation USA to Nicaragua in 2008. George Hamilton assisted with relief to The Philippines Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 as did Barbra Streisand, Rosario Dawson, Jackson Browne, Bill Maher and Judd Apatow.
 Operation USA also relies on film and theater promotions to generate funds that pay for aid, including:"
Opportunity International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_International	"Opportunity International is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that is working to end global poverty by creating and sustaining jobs. Through a network of 47 program and support partners, Opportunity provides small business loans, savings, insurance and training to more than 14 million people in the developing world. It has clients in more than 20 countries and works with fundraising partners in the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. Opportunity International has 501(c)(3) status as a tax-exempt charitable organization in the United States of America under the US Internal Revenue Code (Employer Identification Number: 54-0907624).[2]
 In 1971, Al Whittaker left his job as president of Bristol Myers International Corporation in America to found the Institute for International Development Incorporated (IIDI), a micro-enterprise organization. Barry Harper, IIDI's first Executive Director, and development officer Dan Swanson together oversaw establishment of IDII offices in Colombia, Peru, Honduras, Kenya, the Dominican Republic and Indonesia.
 Australian philanthropist David Bussau founded Maranatha Trust and began administering loans in Indonesia in 1977. In 1979, he joined IDII as the director of the Indonesia office and began expanding IDII's work in Asia.[3]
 In 1988, the two merged their efforts under the name Opportunity International. Since that time, the organization has continued to grow.
 In 1991, a group of women supporting Opportunity International called the Women's Opportunity Network created a group-lending methodology called the Trust Group in which groups would be responsible for their peers and hold them accountable for repayment. Opportunity began testing this group lending and Trust Group method in the Philippines in 1992, and in the same year, they began to focus on serving entrepreneurs at even more extreme levels of poverty.
 Realizing that no one group can tackle the issues of poverty alone, Opportunity began developing partners - independent, self-governing organizations with similar motivations - in countries and regions around the world. In 1998, Opportunity formalized these partnerships into the Opportunity International Network - a group of partners that now includes 47 entities in over 20 countries.
 In 2000, Opportunity began building a series of permanent and mobile banks to reach more remote areas of countries and attempt to serve those that had previously lacked access to financial services. These formal financial institutions (FFIs) took the form of commercial banks, development banks or credit unions that could accept deposits, borrow money and/or accept investments.
 In 2002, Opportunity International developed and founded MicroEnsure, a microinsurance entity providing weather-indexed crop insurance, affordable health insurance, and protection against other risks. MicroEnsure was the world's first microinsurance intermediary and received a generous grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2008. MicroEnsure spun off from Opportunity as its own company, and in 2013 it became a for-profit social enterprise.[4]
 On January 24, 2006, David Bussau gave the 10th Australia Day Address with the subject ""A Giving Nation."" [5] And in January, 2008, David Bussau was named Senior Australian of the Year 2008 for his work in the fight against global poverty.[6]
 Al Whittaker passed away in 2006.[7]
 Opportunity was founded as and remains a non-denominational Christian organization that serves all its clients regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity or gender.
 In 2017, Opportunity International's operation in Malawi was sold to southern African banking group FMB Capital.
 [8]
 Like many microfinance organizations, Opportunity often lends to clients through group lending. At Opportunity, these lending groups are called Trust Groups and consist of 10 to 30 entrepreneurs who pledge to guarantee each other's loans. The groups meet regularly to share personal and business advice, receive financial training and vote on loan-related topics.
 Trust Groups are designed to build a safety net by guaranteeing each other's loans - if one member defaults on a weekly payment, everyone else must cover the costs. The idea is that the group guarantee replaces the need for collateral, so that credit becomes available to those previously excluded from formal financial services.
 Each week, as Trust Groups gather to repay their loans, Opportunity provides educational sessions to develop business skills and enhance personal growth.[9]
 The efficacy of group lending has been debated since it was first introduced by the Grameen Bank in the 1970s. As MFIs have become more advanced and increased their scale, it has become less costly for them to monitor borrowers, allowing them to be less reliant on group lending and peer enforcement. According to JPAL, there is little evidence on the relative impacts of individual lending versus group lending on household consumption, income and enterprise creation.[10]
 Today, Opportunity recruits and develops staff from the countries it serves. Its global team has grown to 23,000 employees, 99% of whom are nationals, with over 10,000 loan officers working directly with microfinance clients.[11]
 Over the last 10 years, Opportunity has invested more than $20 million in electronic and mobile technology to reduce transaction costs and bring services to the most marginalized and remote people. Satellite branches and mobile banks reach clients in previously unserved areas, like rural farming villages and sprawling urban markets. Biometric technology provides convenient and secure access to finances, even for those who are illiterate or lack formal identification. Convenient ATMs and point-of-sale (POS) devices offer the only safe method for transactions in many markets and allow clients to make transactions near home, thereby reducing transportation costs, improving their productivity and increasing the safety of their savings deposits. Over half of the developing world's population uses cell phones. Opportunity's banking programs enable clients to repay loans or transfer funds in Opportunity savings accounts from their mobile device. Cell phone technology gives clients in remote locations access to their accounts.
 Opportunity's investment in mobile technology parallels a larger trend in the industry to utilize technology to improve microfinance and development initiatives. Mobile money, in particular, is transforming microfinance and banking around the world. In 2013, the total value of transactions made by mobile phones in Kenya was $24 billion - more than half the country's GDP.[12]
 Challenges of mobile money include security concerns and questions around regulation. As The Guardian notes, cooperation between the technology, policy and NGO communities will be critical moving forward.[13]
 According to UN Women, women make up 60% of the chronically hungry, more than two thirds of the world's illiterate population and receive lower wages for the same work.[14] Opportunity focuses its services, including loans, savings accounts, insurance, training and financial access, on women - providing 95 of their loans to women. Research shows that women are far more likely to reinvest their earnings in their homes and families, extending the benefit of these services to the entire family. Studies suggest that women reinvest 90% of their income back into their families.[15]
 Opportunity EduFinance is a global program partner of Opportunity International, launched in 2007 and based in London UK. [16]
 More than 124 million children and adolescents around the world, half of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa, have never started school or have already dropped out.[17]
 Opportunity invests in parents and educators to help children go to school and receive a high quality education. Opportunity's EduFinance tools include: 
 Alongside financial tools, Opportunity supports educators with other tools and programs including: 
 Opportunity has reached 1.7 million children and distributed $69M in education loans since 2009.
 In October 2016, Opportunity announced that it received a $1 million grant to expand EduFinance from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.[19]
 In November 2016, Opportunity International won the Civil Society Achievement Honor at the Children and Youth Finance International Global Inclusion Awards 2016.[20]
 One in four Africans - about 260 million people - suffer from hunger.[21] Many of them are farmers operating at just 40 percent of their capacity. Farmers in the developing world face many challenges including: limited access to financial resources, high-quality farm inputs, markets and technical assistance and practicing side-selling to cover seasonal cash flows.
 To address these and other challenges, Opportunity International has introduced the following programs, tools and initiatives: 
 Agricultural lending is unique from traditional microfinance because the needs of famers are unique. Research shows that client-centric, responsive approaches have enabled some MFIs to adapt to the needs of farm households and seasonal agricultures. Branchless banking and mobile money have also aided in advancing agricultural finance in rural communities.[23]
 Opportunity works through local program partners to better understand and meet the needs of families they serve. 
Local partners must share Opportunity's values and objectives. Their stated requirements for partners are:
 They also look for partners with:
 The Opportunity Network is made up of 47 organizations, 39 of which are microfinance institutions (program partners) operating in Africa, Eastern Europe, Central and East Asia and Latin America. These program partners provide loans and other support directly to families in need. Funds to support the work of program partners are raised through support partners operating in various countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the USA. These funds are provided to program partners as either equity, loans or grants. While program and support partners have close relationships, each operates as an independent legal entity. No program or support partner acts as agent for any other program or support partner, nor has authority to bind any other program or support partner. Opportunity International was the first organization to approach microfinance using a microfinance network.
 Opportunity serves clients in the following countries in Africa: 
 Opportunity serves clients in the following countries in Asia:
 Opportunity serves clients in the following countries in Eastern Europe:
 Opportunity serves clients in the following countries in Latin America:
 Opportunity partners raise support in the following countries:
 In 2016, Atul Tandon joined Opportunity International as the US CEO. Global CEO Vicki Escarra joined Opportunity in 2012 and served as US CEO before becoming Global CEO.[25]
 Opportunity International Australia Limited is a part of the global Opportunity International Network.[26] Opportunity International Australia Limited was registered as a charity under the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission in January 1989.[27]
 Opportunity International Australia also provides support services to its loan recipients such as business training, financial literacy training and community development initiatives.[28] It currently works in India, Indonesia and the Philippines by funding and supporting local microfinance institutions.[29] These services include loans, savings, fund transfers and insurance. Opportunity International Australia has a repayment rate of 97%.[30] Opportunity International is a signatory to ACFID.[31]
 In 2008, Opportunity International Australia's founder David Bussau was recognized for his long-standing contribution to poverty alleviation by being named Senior Australian of the Year 2008.[32]
 Macro For Micro was a campaign in 2010 to raise funds and awareness for microfinance development.[33] It consisted of a team of Canadian cyclists (Geoff Dittrich, Stu McCrory, Vivian Leung and Isabella Borowiec) that travelled over 5,600 km from Sydney, Australia to Perth, Australia along the southern coast.[34] The campaign aimed to raise A$50,000 for Opportunity Australia to fight poverty. The team stopped at universities, high schools and sponsored venues along the way to share the story of microfinance. They departed Sydney on March 8 (International Women's Day), 2010 and arrived in Perth on 29 May 2010.[35]
 Opportunity International Canada is also part of the global Opportunity International Network.[36] One of the more recent members in the Network, Opportunity International Canada began in 1998, when a dedicated group of entrepreneurial Canadian business people rallied to launch it as a registered charity in Canada. Dale Patterson is the current President and CEO of Opportunity Canada.
 In addition to a National Office in Toronto, Opportunity International Canada has staff members in Vancouver, Montréal and London,[37] as well as a significant volunteer base in Alberta.[38]
 Starting in 2009, Opportunity International Canada staff and volunteers created programs and initiatives like Faces of Opportunity[39] and MarketDay.[40] Faces of Opportunity is a small coffee table book of microfinance client stories. MarketDay is a program in schools, churches, and clubs which aims to involve and educate young people with the microfinance and entrepreneurship.
 
Opportunity International Germany was founded in 1996 by Karl Schock, a businessman, as an independent foundation.[41] Opportunity International Deutschland raises funds and awareness for microfinance services in Ghana, Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda, Mozambique, Dominican Republic, India, Nicaragua and the Philippines.[42] The current CEO is Mark Ankerstein. Opportunity International UK is part of the global Opportunity International Network.  Opportunity UK is currently serving more than 1.2 million African's by raising funds to help develop microfinance in Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania and Ghana.  They also support projects in Rwanda, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and South Africa.
 Opportunity also raises support in:
 In 2012, The Social Performance Task Force (SPTF) launched the Universal Standards for Social Performance Management. These standards incorporate the Smart Campaign's Client Protection Principles and set standards on: defining and monitoring social goals, governance, treatment of clients, development of products and services, treatment of employees, and balancing financial and social performance.[43]
 Opportunity's Social Performance Management (SPM) program is used in India, the Philippines and an expanding number of countries in Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America.
 The Progress Out of Poverty Index (PPI) scorecard is a tool that helps monitor the effects of microfinance on income levels. The scorecard includes simple questions related to the client's income level, such as:
 By assessing the answers to questions such as these, it is possible to gauge the relative income level and poverty status of a family and help ensure they are receiving benefits from interventions in various areas of their life.
 Opportunity has also piloted the Social Return on Investment (SROI) methodology in both India and the Philippines. SROI is a framework for measuring and accounting for the value added to the lives of families served, looking at social, environmental and economic benefits of microfinance and then quantifying the amount of change that has taken place.
 [44]
 There is no evidence presented in Opportunity International (OI) publications of summary-level improvements in household income or jobs created by OI's borrowers.  This is not surprising, since scientific testing of the impact of microcredit is surprisingly difficult.  Dozens of studies have looked at the experience of people who received microloans.  The challenge has been to identify a control group for comparison: it is difficult and expensive to find a group of people who are like the loan recipients in all relevant ways except for not having gotten a loan. Two studies looked at standard microcredit clients over a short period (12–18 months) using randomized controlled trials found no evidence of improvements in household income or consumption.  For now, it seems an honest summary of the evidence to say that we simply do not know yet whether microcredit or other forms of microfinance are helping to lift millions out of poverty.[45]
 Further, one of the least remarked-on problems facing the world's poor living on two dollars a day is that they do not literally get that amount each day.  In other words, economic poverty is not just a matter of low incomes, but also of irregular and uncertain incomes.  To put food on the table every day and meet other basic consumption needs, poor households have to save and borrow constantly.[46]  One research team presented results of year-long financial diaries collected about twice a month from hundreds of rural and urban households in India, Bangladesh, and South Africa.  They consistently found the poor use credit and savings to smooth consumption, to deal with emergencies like health problems and to accumulate the larger sums they need to seize opportunities—occasionally business opportunities—and pay for big-ticket expenses like education, weddings and funerals.[47] Over the year, the average diary household used 8 to 10 different types of financial instruments; most types were used multiple times.  The notion that microcredit brings loans to people who previously had no access to them is widespread but mistaken, as is the notion that the strong majority of microloans are used for business purposes.[48]
 Finally, it seems unlikely that a year of microlending helps poor people as much as a year of girls' primary education, for example.  The true advantage of microfinance is not that each ""dose"" is more powerful, but rather that each dose costs much less than subsidies.  Social programs like primary education and health care usually require large continuing subsidies, using up scarce tax dollars year after year.  Microfinancing is different:  when it is done right, relatively small up-front subsidies lead to permanent institutions that can continue providing services year after year with no further subsidy needed, and can expand those services to reach many millions of low-income clients.[49]
 Opportunity earned the acclaimed Civil Society Achievement Honor at the Children and Youth Finance International (CYFI) Global Inclusion Awards of 2016, held November 28, 2016 in Stockholm, Sweden.[50]

Orbis International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbis_International	"Orbis International is an international non-profit non-governmental organization (NGO) dedicated to saving sight worldwide.[1] Its programs focus on the prevention of blindness and the treatment of blinding eye diseases in developing countries through hands-on training, public health education, advocacy and local partnerships.[2] Since 1982, Orbis capacity-building programs have enhanced the skills of 325,000 eye care personnel and provided medical and optical treatment to more than 23.3 million people in 92 countries.[3]
 Orbis is a registered 501(c)(3) tax-deductible non-profit charity in the United States.[4] It is rated 4 stars on Charity Navigator[4] and is a Guidestar Gold Participant.[5] It is headquartered in New York, with offices in Toronto, London, Dublin, Hong Kong, Macau, Shanghai, Singapore and Cape Town.
 Orbis' programs emphasise skills, training and self-sufficiency. The organisation spends approximately a year planning and coordinating with partner hospitals and local organisations, making preliminary visits to observe the local medical teams.[6] The Flying Eye Hospital not only provides training, but also equipment and surgical supplies to ensure that the local medical teams are equipped with skills and supplies long after the flying eye hospital has left the program site.[7] It ensures that other patients who are in need of treatment are able to get the treatment even after the hospital has departed. Cybersight, Orbis' telemedicine program, continues the training and mentoring relationships even after the Flying Eye Hospital has left the program site.[8] Orbis' intervention are tailored to local needs; Orbis trains local doctors in low-tech, low-cost yet effective methods to correct diseases of the eyes.[9]
 In addition to the Flying Eye Hospital, Orbis operates hospital-based programs in several countries and works with local medical research and health-care organizations on blindness prevention and eye disease treatment.
 Orbis is a founding partner, along with the World Health Organization, of VISION 2020: The Right to Sight, ""a worldwide concerted effort designed to eliminate avoidable blindness by the year 2020.""
 Orbis was founded in 1982 with a grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and a number of private donors. The first Flying Eye Hospital was a Douglas DC-8-21 (N220RB) donated by United Airlines. In its first two years of operation, the Orbis DC-8 visited 24 countries and held programs emphasizing the hands-on transfer of surgical skills.
 By the late 1980s, as replacement parts for the aging DC-8 became more difficult and expensive to obtain, it became clear that a newer, larger aircraft was needed. Funded by private donations, Orbis purchased its current DC-10 in 1992. The DC-10 contained twice the interior space of the original DC-8. After two years of conversion and renovation, it was placed in service in 1994, and the DC-8 was retired and donated to Datangshan museum near Beijing.  That summer, the new Flying Eye Hospital took off on its inaugural mission to Beijing, China.
 In 1998, Orbis embarked on a new path based on the strategy to strengthen the capacity of local partners in the developing world to prevent and treat blindness through full-time, ongoing in-country programs. These programs were designed to respond to the needs of individual ophthalmic communities and local eye care providers. Orbis selected the first initial five countries to work in year round based on need (magnitude of blindness), opportunity (local infrastructure and resources), and safety & stability to operate in-country.
 Orbis launched its first permanent country program in Ethiopia. Country programs in Bangladesh, China, India and Vietnam soon followed. In 2010 Orbis established a country program office in South Africa. Permanent Orbis offices in these countries, run by local staff, develop and implement an array of multi-year projects to improve the quality and accessibility of eye care to residents, particularly in rural area and impoverished urban communities. In addition to permanent country offices, Orbis also engages in long-term program work in several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean as well is in countries including Nepal, Zambia, and Burkina Faso.
 On April 7, 2008,  Orbis announced it would replace its current DC-10 Flying Eye Hospital with a DC-10 Series 30 freighter. United Airlines, with the support of FedEx, is donating the airplane to Orbis. The $2 million donation is based on the plane's estimated value and is being funded equally by United and FedEx.
 On August 8, 2011, FedEx announced that it would donate one of its DC-10-30s, retrofitted with the MD-10-30F upgrade, to Orbis to replace its DC-10-30F. The new MD-10 will feature a modular hospital suite, the first time these units will have been used on an aircraft.[10]
 In 2012, Orbis Celebrated its 30th Anniversary of Saving Sight Worldwide.
 
Orbis is well known for its ""Flying Eye Hospital,"" an ophthalmic hospital and teaching facility located on board a MD-10 aircraft. The Flying Eye Hospital brings training to doctors and nurses in developing countries with little access to professional development and training. Classrooms, operating theatres and laser rooms are aboard the plane and the local medical personnel are able to watch live surgeries as well as simulations.[11] 3D filming and broadcast facilities allow the local ophthalmic professionals to observe the live surgeries through the eyes of the surgeon.[8] Surgeries can also be broadcast to additional classes outside of the aircraft, be it a local hospital or halfway across the world. Participants can ask questions via a two-way audio-visual system.[12] Volunteer pilots donate their time and skills to fly the hospital to the various program sites. In June 2016, Orbis revealed its third-generation Flying Eye Hospital. The hospital is a converted McDonnell Douglas DC-10 donated by FedEx and can fly twice as long as its predecessor. It is similar to a land-based hospital and is outfitted with safety features such as a back-up generator and early alert monitoring systems.[13] The hospital also has its own water treatment plant and air conditioning systems.[14] It also houses a 46-seat classroom, sterilization room and operating room and uses 3D technology and live broadcast systems which allow local participants to observe surgeries while they are taking place.[15] A virtual tour of the plane was created as part of the launch which enables users to virtually explore all areas of the plane including the operating room and cargo hold.
 Orbis's previous DC-10-10, which was the oldest flying example of its type by then, has since been donated to the Pima Air & Space Museum. It arrived at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in November 2016[16] and is currently under restoration.
 In addition to the Flying Eye Hospital, operates long-term country programs and collaborates with local governments and organisations and push for eye care to be integrated into national health programs.[9] It has also worked with local universities and healthcare institutions and manage a team of more than 400 medical volunteers from 29 countries to provide expert training to their local partners.[2]
 In each country, Orbis works with its local partner institutions to increase their capacity to provide comprehensive, affordable and sustainable eye care services over the long term. The programs include developing specialized hospital facilities, eye banks, patient and health care worker training, and prevention and treatment programs.[17]
 In 2015 alone, more than 30,000 medical professionals were trained and more than 2 million patients were examined either on board Flying Eye Hospital or at its partner institutions.[13]
 Cybersight is a telemedicine portal that allows eye health workers in low- and middle-income countries to consult with expert mentors in their field, free of charge. Mentors give their opinion on patient cases, share learning materials, and help local eye health workers develop their skills in blindness treatment and prevention. Since its launch, more than 10,000 electronic cases have taken place.[18] This allows for distance learning and discussion, and ensures that the local medical teams of the various program sites are able to benefit from Orbis' services even after the Flying Eye Hospital has left the site.
 Cybersight also offers regular live lectures, a library of educational material, and allows users to take tests and receive certificates of achievement.[19]
 On September 10th, Orbis announced a new collaboration with AI company Visulytix to apply their automated imaging technology to Cybersight. Visulytix's Pegasus AI system will be used to analyse images of the back of the eye taken with any standard retina camera or smartphone. Eye doctors in low-resource countries will be amongst the first in the world to have free access to this service on the Cybersight platform, helping them detect and diagnose sight-threatening eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, as well as quickly request a second opinion from Orbis’s network of medical experts.

Ormiston Trust	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ormiston_Trust	"Ormiston Trust is a charitable trust based in London, England. It is a grant-making trust that chiefly assists schools and organisations supporting children and young people.[1]
 The trust was established in the memory of Fiona Ormiston Murray who died in a car crash with her husband on their honeymoon in 1969.[2]
 Much of the trust's work is accomplished through its two main subsidiaries - Ormiston Families and Ormiston Academies Trust.
 Ormiston Families (formerly Ormiston Children and Families Trust) is a charitable company limited by guarantee that has some financial support from Ormiston Trust. It delivers children and family-related projects in East Anglia which include Children's Centres, Prisoner Visitor Centres, support for Gypsies and Travellers, and an Emotional Wellbeing Programme which supports children and young people who are at increased risk of experiencing emotional or mental health problems.[3]
 Ormiston Families operates Prisoner Visitor Centres in the following prisons:[4]
 Ormiston Academies Trust is a charity and incorporated company which operates schools with academy status.[5]
 In total, there are 31 secondary schools operated by Ormiston Academies Trust.
 In total, there are 7 primary schools operated by Ormiston Academies Trust. 2 in the North, 4 in the East and 1 in the South
 In total, there is 1 all-through school operated by Ormiston Academies Trust. 1 in the East."
Oxfam	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfam	"Oxfam is a confederation of 20 independent charitable organizations focusing on the alleviation of global poverty, founded in 1942 and led by Oxfam International.[1] It is a major nonprofit group with an extensive collection of operations.   Winnie Byanyima has been the executive director of Oxfam International since 2013.[2]
 Founded at 17 Broad Street, Oxford, as the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief by a group of Quakers, social activists, and Oxford academics in 1942 and registered in accordance with UK law in 1943, the original Oxford Committee for Famine Relief was a group of concerned citizens including Henry Gillett (a prominent local Quaker), Theodore Richard Milford, Gilbert Murray and his wife Mary, Cecil Jackson-Cole and Alan Pim.[3] The Committee met in the Old Library of University Church of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford, for the first time in 1942, and its aim was to help starving citizens of occupied Greece, a famine caused by the Axis occupation of Greece and Allied naval blockades and  to persuade the British government to allow food relief through the  blockade. The Oxford committee was one of several local committees formed in support of the National Famine Relief Committee.[4]
 Oxfam's first paid employee was Joe Mitty, who began working at the Oxfam shop on Broad Street, Oxford on 9 November 1949. Engaged to manage the accounts and distribute donated clothing, he originated the policy of selling anything which people were willing to donate, and developed the shop into a national chain.[5]
 By 1960, it was a major international non-governmental aid organization.[citation needed]
The first overseas committee was founded in Canada in 1963, and in 1965 the organization changed its name to its telegraphic address, OXFAM. The Oxford committee became known as Oxfam Great Britain or Oxfam GB.[citation needed]
In 1995 Oxfam International was formed by a group of independent non-governmental organizations. Their aim was to work together for greater impact on the international stage to reduce poverty and injustice. Stichting Oxfam International was registered as a non-profit foundation at The Hague, Netherlands in 1996.[6]
 Oxfam's programmes address the structural causes of poverty and related injustice and work primarily through local accountable organizations, seeking to enhance their effectiveness. Oxfam's stated goal is to help people directly when local capacity is insufficient or inappropriate for Oxfam's purposes, and to assist in the development of structures which directly benefit people facing the realities of poverty and injustice.[citation needed] In November 2000, Oxfam adopted the rights-based approach as the framework for all the work of the Confederation and its partners. Oxfam recognizes the universality and indivisibility of human rights and has adopted these overarching aims to express these rights in practical terms:
 Oxfam believes that poverty and powerlessness are avoidable and can be eradicated by human action and political will. It believes in the right to a sustainable livelihood, and the right and capacity to participate in societies and make positive changes to people's lives as basic human needs and rights which can be met. Oxfam believes that peace and substantial arms reduction are essential conditions for development and that inequalities can be significantly reduced both between rich and poor nations and within nations.[citation needed] Oxfam has restructured their donation process and supporter-facing digital in response to a fall in fundraising.[8]
 Although Oxfam's initial concern was the provision of food to relieve famine, over the years the organization has developed strategies to combat the causes of famine. In addition to food and medicine, Oxfam also provides tools to enable people to become self-supporting and opens markets of international trade where crafts and produce from poorer regions of the world can be sold at a fair price to benefit the producer. Oxfam's programme has three main points of focus: development work, which tries to lift communities out of poverty with long-term, sustainable solutions based on their needs; humanitarian work, assisting those immediately affected by conflict and natural disasters (which often leads into longer-term development work), especially in the field of water and sanitation; and lobbyist, advocacy and popular campaigning, trying to affect policy decisions on the causes of conflict at local, national, and international levels.
 Oxfam has four main focuses for its resources: economic justice, essential services, rights in crisis, and gender justice. ""Economic justice"" focuses on making agriculture work for farmers and labourers living in poverty, fairer trade rules for poor countries, and reducing the impact of climate change and energy shocks. ""Essential services"" focuses on, inter alia, demanding that national governments fulfil their responsibilities for equitable delivery of good-quality health, education, water, and sanitation. ""Rights in crisis"" focuses on improving the ability to deliver better protection and greater assistance. ""Gender justice"" focuses on supporting women's leadership and education and ending gender-based violence.[citation needed]
 Oxfam works on trade justice, fair trade, education, debt and aid, livelihoods, health, HIV/AIDS, gender equality, conflict (campaigning for an international arms trade treaty) and natural disasters, democracy and human rights, and climate change. Through programmes like ""Saving for Change"", Oxfam helps communities become more self-sufficient financially. The Saving for Change initiative is a programme whereby communities are taught how to form collective, informal credit groups. Through these mutually beneficial groups, members—who tend to be mostly women—pool their savings into a fund which is used to give loans for activities such as paying for medical care and paying school fees, in addition to using the loans to fund small-scale business ventures. Ultimately, the goal of the programme is to leave the community with a self-sustaining organization where people who otherwise would not qualify for formal bank loans can go for financial assistance. In doing so, borrowers can start businesses which benefit not only themselves but also their communities.[9]
 Oxfam has provided relief services during various global crises, including the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, North Korean famine, 2011 East Africa drought, 2012 Sahel drought, Nepal earthquake[10] and Yemeni crisis.[11] The Bosfam NGO was also founded in May 1995 by women participating in an Oxfam GB psycho-social 'radionice' project to support internally displaced women during the Bosnian war. Oxfam has become a globally recognized leader in providing water sanitation to impoverished and war torn areas the world over. In 2012, Oxfam became one of the humanitarian groups that comprise the UK's Rapid Response Facility to ensure clean water in the wake of humanitarian disasters.[12]
 A January 2014 Oxfam  report stated that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people.[13][14][15][16][17] More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016.[18] A 2017-released Oxfam report has stated that 8 billionaires possess the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of humanity.[19][20][21][22]
 The Make Trade Fair  campaign organized by Oxfam International focuses on the elimination of trade practices, like dumping, which occurs when highly subsidized, surplus commodities from developed countries such as rice, cotton, corn, and sugar are sold at low prices and farmers from poor countries have difficulty competing.[23] Another practice Oxfams opposes is the setting of tariffs, where nations enforce high taxes on imported goods, restricting the sales of products from other nations,[24] unbalanced labour rights for women, who often earn lower wages than their male counterparts,[25] and stringent patent issues that prevent the prices of medication, software, and textbooks (e.g. Gene patents, Chemical patents, and Software patents) from being lowered. Thus, such essential goods are often inaccessible to developing nations.[26]
 Oxfam has shops all over the world, which sell many fair-trade and donated items since their first charity shop opened in 1948,[27] although trading began in 1947. The proceeds from these are used to further Oxfam's mission and relief efforts around the globe. Much of their stock comes from public donations but as of 2012 they still sold fair trade products from developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America, including handcrafts, books, music CDs and instruments, clothing, toys, food and ethnic creations. These objects are brought to the public through fair trade to help boost the quality of life of their producers and surrounding communities.[28]
 As of 2010 Oxfam had over 1,200 shops worldwide.[29] More than half of them were in the UK with around 750 Oxfam GB shops including specialist shops such as books, music, furniture and bridal wear. Oxfam Germany has 45 shops including specialist book shops; Oxfam France shops sell books and fair trade products and Oxfam Hong Kong has 2 shops selling donated goods and fair trade products. Oxfam Novib, Oxfam Australia (with over 20 fair trade shops), Oxfam Ireland and Oxfam in Belgium also raise funds from shops.
 Of the 750 Oxfam charity shops around the UK, around 100 are specialist bookshops or book and music shops. Oxfam is the largest retailer of second-hand books in Europe, selling around 12 million per year. In 2008, Oxfam GB worked with over 20,000 volunteers in shops across the UK, raising £17.1 million for Oxfam's programme work.[30]
 Oxfam has several successful fundraising channels in addition to its shops. Over half a million people in the UK make a regular financial contribution towards its work. In April 2017 the Information Commissioner's Office fined 11 charities that breached the Data Protection Act by misusing donors’ personal data. Oxfam was fined £6,000.[31] Funds are also received from gifts left to the organization in people's wills. Christopher McCandless, the subject of the book and film Into the Wild, donated his life savings to Oxfam before leaving society for the Alaskan wilderness.[citation needed] Many London Marathon[32] competitors raise money for Oxfam, and Oxfam also receives funds in return for providing and organising volunteer stewards at festivals such as Glastonbury. In conjunction with the Gurkha Welfare Trust, Oxfam runs several Trailwalker events in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Japan. Every October, Oxfam holds the Oxjam music festival across the UK.
 The Oxfam International Secretariat (OIS) leads, facilitates, and supports collaboration between the Oxfam affiliates to increase Oxfam's impact on poverty and injustice through advocacy campaigns, development programmes and emergency response. The OIS Board comprises the Executive Director, Chair of each Affiliate, and the OI Chair. The Affiliates' Chairs are voting members and are non-remunerated. The Executive Directors and the OI Chair are all non-voting-members. The Board also elects the Deputy Chair and Treasurer from among its voting members. The Board is responsible for ensuring that Oxfam International is accountable, transparent, and fit for purpose. The constitution and Strategic Plan are also approved at Board level. The Board takes recommendations from Executive Directors and ensures that the Confederation is working to its agreed aims. The Board also agrees membership of the Confederation, selects the Honorary President, the Honorary Advisor, the Board Officers and the OI Executive Director. A number of subcommittees with expert members are also mandated by the Board to assist with specific issues. Oxfam International's official languages are English, French and Spanish; English is the working language.[33] In 2009–10 it had approximately 77 staff (including secondment placements and temporary staff e.g. for maternity cover). It is funded by contributions from affiliate organizations and has an operating budget of US$8.7M.[34] As of Oct 2018 Oxfam International – which is registered in Britain as a 'foreign company' and is not answerable either to the Charity Commission or the British Government – has also seized control of the running of Oxfam's global aid schemes funded by its £915million annual income, nearly half of which comes from the UK.
 In 1970, Oxfam America became an independent nonprofit organization and an Oxfam affiliate in response to the humanitarian crisis created by the fight for independence in Bangladesh. Oxfam America's headquarters are located in Boston, Massachusetts with a policy and campaigns office in Washington, D.C. and seven regional offices around the world. A registered 501(c)3 organization, Oxfam America campaigns for climate change adaptation, food security, aid reform, access to medicines, and fair trade. Ray Offenheiser served as the president and CEO of Oxfam America from 1996 until 2016.[35] As of 2017, the president and CEO is Abby Maxman.[36][37]
 Oxfam Australia is an independent, not-for-profit, secular, community-based aid and development organization, and an affiliate of Oxfam International. Oxfam Australia's work includes long-term development projects, responding to emergencies and campaigning to improve the lives of disadvantaged people around the world. They aim to give disadvantaged people improved access to social services, an effective voice in decisions, equal rights and status, and safety from conflict and disaster. Oxfam Australia's activities are mainly funded by community donation.[38]
 Oxfam in Belgium is a co-ordinating body of the Belgian components of the Oxfam movement, namely, Oxfam Solidarity, Oxfam Fair Trade, Magasins du Monde Oxfam and Oxfam Wereldwinkels. Oxfam Solidarity incorporates the activities of Oxfam Belgium (founded in 1964) and those of Oxfam Projects (created in 1976). Oxfam Solidarity supports approximately 200 projects and programmes in the South totalling around 10 million Euro, thanks to co-financing by the Belgian government and the European Union. The income of the organization comes from recycling activities, from the support of donors and as a result of campaigns. Oxfam Wereldwinkels (founded in 1971) and Magasins du Monde-Oxfam (founded in 1975) remain autonomous organizations, focusing on fair trade. With more than 220 outlets, as many groups and 7000 volunteers, they form a movement which, guided by the principles of fair trade, pursues objectives similar to those of Oxfam Solidarity. The president of Oxfam solidarity is since 2013 a Green party politician, Guido Van Hecken[39] and also the person who provided the car for the Church Street bombing.[40] Oxfam Wereldwinkels has also an agreement with the Union of Agricultural Work Committees to sell their products.[41] According to USAID and others, that organisation is affiliated to the terror organisation Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.[42]
 Oxfam Fair Trade received some critics due to a rather suggestive poster campaign in 2005.[43]
 Oxfam Canada is a founding member of Oxfam. It traces its history to 1963, when the British-based Oxford Committee for Famine Relief sought to establish a Canadian branch. Oxfam Canada was independently incorporated in 1966; the first Board of Directors included 21 distinguished Canadians. In 1967, Oxfam Canada became a key organizer of the successful Miles for Millions fundraising walks across the country; Lester Pearson (then Canadian Prime Minister) led Oxfam's first Miles for Millions March. With its revenues, Oxfam began to provide educational materials to schools and undertake advocacy work in public policy development. In 1973, Oxfam-Québec became an independent member of the international Oxfam movement.[44]
 IBIS was founded as an independent organization in 1991, but has its roots in the Danish department of World University Service and has been active since the 1966 (initially mainly against apartheid and similar situations in other southern African nations).[45][46] Since the 1970s, it mainly worked with projects in Africa and Latin America, and usually focused on democracy, education and the causes of poverty.[45][47] In 2014 IBIS became an observer member of Oxfam and in October 2016 it became a full member.[47][48] Around the same time, the name was modified from IBIS to Oxfam IBIS.[46][48]
 Oxfam France was founded in 1988 under the name ""Agir ici pour un monde solidaire"" (Act here for a unified world). Its work was already based on campaign and advocacy, both of which were rare in France at the time. Agir ici became an observer member of Oxfam in 2003, and a fully-fledged member in 2006.[49] Based in Paris, Oxfam France claims its missions are to inform, increase public awareness & mobilize citizens. Oxfam France's work in advocacy and research focuses on Economic Justice (especially tax revenue in developing countries, ODA, tax heavens and innovative financing), Agriculture (speculation and food prizes, biofuels, land grabbing, trade rules), protecting civilians, and health. Oxfam France is funded mostly by public donations and by institutional donors.[50] It has five second-hand shops:[51] three bookshops (two in Paris, one in Lille), a clothes shop in Lille and a shop in Strasbourg.
 Oxfam Germany has its beginnings in an initiative by private citizens who in 1986 opened a secondhand shop in Bonn modelled on the idea of the British charity shops. While not officially associated with Oxfam, the shop was staffed by volunteers and sold donated goods, with all proceeds  given to projects run by Oxfam GB. A second shop, following the same model, was opened in Cologne in 1991.[52] Oxfam officially came to Germany in 1995 with the foundation of the charitable Oxfam Deutschland e. V. and its commercial subsidiary Oxfam Deutschland Shops GmbH. Oxfam Germany became a full affiliate of Oxfam International in 2003.[53] As of February 2017, Oxfam was operating 52 charity shops in 34 German cities,[54] including five Oxfam bookshops and three fashion boutiques. According to the Oxfam Germany website, there are 2,400 volunteers in those shops.[55]
 Oxfam GB's headquarters are in Cowley, Oxford. The finance office is in Newcastle, from where Oxfam shops are managed.[56] Oxfam GB had a total income of £408.6m in 2016/17, had 5,000 employees, and used the services of 23,000 volunteers.[57][58] 
In 2016 it received £31.7m from the British government.[59] Mark Goldring was the chief executive officer from 2013 until January 2019, when he was replaced by Dr Dhananjayan (Danny) Sriskandarajah.[60] In 2017 Oxfam GB advocated an increased migration to the UK through family reunification in recommendations to the government, suggesting that legal aid should cover family-reunification issues.[61]
 Oxfam Hong Kong began in 1976, when volunteers came together, opened a second-hand shop, and raised funds for anti-poverty projects around the world. Some of the first actions in the 1970s and '80s were to advocate for justice in the Vietnamese Boat People/Refugee crisis in Hong Kong, and to help save lives in Ethiopia during the 1984 famine. To date, Oxfam Hong Kong has assisted poor people in more than 70 countries/states around the world.[62]
 Oxfam's involvement in India began when money was granted in 1951 to fight famine in Bihar.  Bihar at the time was one of the poorest and most populated states in India.
 Oxfam had launched an appeal which led to the first report of Oxfam's work in House of Commons in UK. On 31 May 1951, Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations had commended the Bihar appeal, stating ""the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief (then name of Oxfam) has made an appeal for donations and I hope individuals will reply to that generously"". Among the many donations received was one for 100 British pounds from an Indian Rajah in appreciation of what Oxfam was doing for the hungry of his country.[63]
 Bihar and famine would bring Oxfam back to India in 1965 to address drought due to bad monsoons.  Bihar held a population of 53 million, of which 40 million relied on subsistence farming to live.[64][page needed] This would compound for India in the future; production of food had not been parallel to its exploding population.  It is estimated that, over the course of the droughts and famines, 2,400 tons of milk was bought by Oxfam and at the height of this was feeding over 400,000 starving children and mothers.[65]  In 1968 Oxfam's first field director in India, Jim Howard, created the Oxfam Gramdan Action Programme, or OGAP.[65]  This was the first joint rural development programme in Oxfam history and the first step to a new 'operational' Oxfam.  Oxfam India was established on 1 September 2008 under section 25 of the Companies Act, 2005 as a non profitable organization with its head office in Delhi and is now a member of Oxfam International Confederation. This was marked by Oxfam's 60th year in India.[66]
 Oxfam Ireland works with local partner organizations in developing countries to develop effective solutions to poverty and injustice. It is a registered charity in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, with headquarters in Dublin and Belfast. Funds are raised via shops, the government and donors. There are 51 shops throughout Ireland selling goods donated by the public. The Irish government allocated over €3.7m to Oxfam work in 2008–9. Supporters donate regularly via direct debit or to special appeals. Oxfam Ireland is the public title of the two legal bodies registered in the respective jurisdictions as Oxfam Northern Ireland and Oxfam Republic of Ireland. Oxfam Ireland operates coherently on an all-island basis by means of a single management structure and shared membership of associations and councils.
 Oxfam Novib is the Dutch affiliate of the international Oxfam organization. The organization is based in The Hague. Oxfam Novib was founded under the name Novib in 1956. Novib, an abbreviation standing for Nederlandse Organisatie Voor Internationale Bijstand (Dutch organization for international aid), was later changed to Nederlandse Organisatie voor Internationale Ontwikkelingssamenwerking (Dutch organization for international development cooperation) due to a change in approach of the organization's development work.[citation needed] In 1994, Novib became an affiliate of Oxfam and the organization changed its name in 2006 to Oxfam Novib.
 Oxfam New Zealand [67] is an aid and development organization and affiliate of Oxfam International who conduct humanitarian, development and advocacy work to support positive and lasting change for communities living in poverty.[68] Oxfam NZ is also responsible for delivering Cyclone relief in several countries in the Pacific region.[69] Oxfam New Zealand's work is made possible by supporters, interns, staff, volunteers, board and overseas partners. Most of the staff are based in their Auckland office. They also have a policy unit in Wellington.[70] Most of Oxfam New Zealand's funds come from donations, supplemented by New Zealand government funds.
 In 2005, Oxfam Great Britain was criticised by other NGOs for becoming too close to Tony Blair's New Labour government in the UK.[71]
 In October 2005, the magazine New Internationalist described Oxfam as a ""Big International Non-Government Organisation (BINGO)"", having a corporate-style, undemocratic internal structure, and addressing the symptoms rather than the causes of international poverty – especially by acquiescing to neoliberal economics and even taking over roles conventionally filled by national governments.[72] Similar criticism came from Red Pepper magazine in July 2005 [73] and Katherine Quarmby in the New Statesman in May 2005.[74] The latter article detailed growing rifts between Oxfam and other organisations within the Make Poverty History movement.
 In a 2011 Columbia Journalism Review article, journalist Karen Rothmyer accused NGOs in general and Oxfam in particular of being unduly influenced by the priorities of the media, of providing inaccurate information to the press (""stories featuring aid projects often rely on dubious numbers provided by the organisations"") and of perpetuating negative stereotypes which ""have the potential to influence policy"". She drew on earlier work by journalist Lauren Gelfand, who had taken a year away from journalism to work for Oxfam; ""A lot of what Oxfam does is to sustain Oxfam"" and Linda Polman, author of the Crisis Caravan; ""Aid organisations are businesses dressed up like Mother Theresa.""[75]
In 2015, Omaar and de Waal, in Food and Power in Sudan, commented, ""the 1990s have seen growing pressure for humanitarian institutions to become more accountable. There has been a succession of reviews of major operations, growing in independence and criticism.""[76] They quote an OECD report, ""The Joint Evaluation of Emergency Operations in Rwanda"", which stated that its team ""came across examples of Agencies telling, if not falsehoods, then certainly half-truths"" and noted ""a remarkable lack of attempts by agencies to seek the views of beneficiaries on the assistance being provided"".[77]
 Oxfam and others launched the Sphere Project in response, an initiative which aims to ""improve the quality of assistance provided to people affected by disasters"", to ""develop a set of minimum standards in core areas of humanitarian assistance"" and to introduce an element of accountability which had previously been lacking.
 On 26 October 2006, Oxfam accused Starbucks of asking the National Coffee Association (NCA) to block a US trademark application from Ethiopia for three of the country's coffee beans, Sidamo, Harar and Yirgacheffe.[78]  They claimed this could result in denying Ethiopian coffee farmers potential annual earnings of up to £47m. Ethiopia and Oxfam America urged Starbucks to sign a licensing agreement with Ethiopia to help boost prices paid to farmers. At issue was Starbucks' use of Ethiopia's coffee brands—Sidamo, Yirgacheffe and Harar—that generate high margins for Starbucks and cost consumers a premium, yet generated very low prices to Ethiopian farmers.  Robert Nelson, the head of the NCA, added that his organization initiated the opposition for economic reasons, ""For the U.S. industry to exist, we must have an economically stable coffee industry in the producing world ... This particular scheme is going to hurt the Ethiopian coffee farmers economically."" The NCA claimed the Ethiopian government was being badly advised and this move could price them out of the market.[78]
 Facing more than 90,000 letters of concern, Starbucks had placed pamphlets in its stores accusing Oxfam of ""misleading behavior"" and insisting that its ""campaign need[s] to stop"". On 7 November, The Economist derided Oxfam's ""simplistic"" stance and Ethiopia's ""economically illiterate"" government, arguing that Starbucks' (and Illy's) standards-based approach would ultimately benefit farmers more.[79] 
In June 2007,  Ethiopian Government representatives and senior leaders from Starbucks Coffee Company worked out an agreement regarding distribution, marketing and licensing that recognized the importance and integrity of Ethiopia's specialty coffee designations without disclosing financial term.  Starbucks was set to market Ethiopian coffee during two promotional periods in 2008. An Oxfam spokesman said the deal sounds like a ""useful step"" as long as farmers are benefiting, and a big step from a year prior when Starbucks ""wasn't engaging directly (with) Ethiopians on adding value to their coffee"".[80]
 On 28 April 2007 an Australian conservative think tank, the Institute of Public Affairs, lodged a complaint with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission accusing Oxfam of misleading or deceptive conduct under the Trade Practices Act in its promotion of Fairtrade coffee.[81] They claimed that high certification costs and low wages for workers undermine claims that Fairtrade helps to lift producers out of poverty. The complaint was subsequently dismissed by the Commission.[82]
 As of 2013 Oxfam endorsed the two-state solution and wants Israel to lift the blockade of the Gaza Strip and dismantle all of the Israeli settlement infrastructure.[83]
 Oxfam UK has partnered with the Board of Deputies who represent the Jewish Community of the UK. The project, Grow-Tatzmiach, includes sending 25 people to an activist training programme to help fight global hunger. In exchange for partnering, Oxfam has agreed not to ""call for a boycott of Israeli goods or to support groups that do so, and will not partner with organizations that advocate violence or oppose a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict"". Despite this agreement, there are still those on both sides who object to this project.[83]
 In October 2009, Oxfam was accused by Israeli NGO Regavim of aiding Palestinians in illegal activities in Kiryat Arba, including water theft. Oxfam has denied its participation.[84]
 In response to a 2012 Oxfam report which laid the blame for poor economic development in the Palestinian territories solely with Israel, a spokesman for the Israel embassy in the UK said, ""Oxfam's latest report on the situation in the Palestinian territories puts a clearly political agenda above any humanitarian concern. Far from advancing peace, such an approach undermines the prospects of reaching a negotiated resolution to the conflict.""[85]
 On 17 January 2014 Oxfam UK cancelled an exhibition ""Gaza: Through my Eyes"" which had been due to take place at East London Mosque after Left Foot Forward presented information to the charity detailing homophobic and potentially anti-semitic comments by one of the organizers, Ibrahim Hewitt. Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell was reported as welcoming the event's cancellation but to have said of Oxfam UK, ""it is hugely disappointing that it did no proper checks on (Mr. Hewitt) before agreeing his presence.""[86]
 On 29 January 2014 actress Scarlett Johansson resigned as an international spokeswoman for Oxfam after appearing in a TV ad for SodaStream, a company with presence in the West Bank. Her publicist stated that Johansson ""respectfully decided to end her ambassador role with Oxfam after eight years ... She and Oxfam have a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement.""[87]
 In February 2015, Israeli NGO Regavim released a report stating that the European Union had illegally funded the construction of houses; Oxfam and other NGOs participated in the project. Oxfam defended the construction ""on humanitarian grounds.""
 In December 2009 Duncan Green, head of research at Oxfam, attempted to discredit the PopOffsets initiative of Population Matters, (formerly known as the Optimum Population Trust), under which individuals can offset their carbon emissions by funding family planning services in the developing world. Green wrote in an op-ed in the New Statesman that assumptions such as those in the OPT report equating population growth and environmental degradation are a ""gross oversimplification"".[88]
 In response, OPT described the response of parts of the development lobby to the initiative as ""frankly disgraceful"", adding: ""The world badly needs a grown-up, rational discussion of the population issue ... without blame, abuse and hysteria.""[89]
 Oxfam has been criticized[90][91] for aggressively expanding its specialist bookshops, using tactics more often associated with multi-national corporations. The charity has been criticized as some claim this expansion has come at the expense of independent secondhand book sellers and other charity shops in many areas of the UK.
 In May 2013 Oxfam demanded Dole remove its 'Ethical Choice' labels from its bananas in New Zealand until it improved treatment of its workers in the Philippines.[92] A Dole spokesperson said Oxfam's report was a ""commercial move"" aimed at backing a rival supplier which backed Oxfam, and Oxfam was ""trying to destroy the Dole brand"".[citation needed]
 In 2014, Private Eye magazine criticized Oxfam for former Pearson CEO Dame Marjorie Scardino as its trustees, while actively campaigning against corporate tax avoidance as part of the If Coalition, Oxfam . Private Eye claims that during Dame Marjorie's 'reign' at Pearson, 'the company was a prolific tax haven user ... routing hundreds of millions of pounds through an elaborate series of Luxembourg companies (and a Luxembourg branch of a UK company) to avoid tax.'[93]
 Time Inc. Network wrote a reply to an Oxfam study from January 2015[94] on inequality stating that the richest 1% at the end of 2016 will own more than half of the world's assets. However, Time pointed out that the data were based on a study from Credit Suisse. In this study, The Global Wealth Databook 2015, personal assets were calculated in net worth, meaning wealth would be negated by having any mortgages.[95]
 In February 2018 an investigation by The Times newspaper found that Oxfam allowed three men to resign and sacked four for gross misconduct after an inquiry concerning sexual exploitation, the downloading of pornography, bullying and intimidation. A 2011 confidential report by Oxfam had found “a culture of impunity” among some staff in Haiti and concluded that 'it cannot be ruled out that any of the prostitutes were under-aged'. Among the staff who were permitted to resign was the charity's Belgian country director, Roland Van Hauwermeiren.[96] In the internal report, Van Hauwermeiren admitted using prostitutes at a villa whose rent was paid for by Oxfam with charitable funds. Oxfam's chief executive at the time, Dame Barbara Stocking, offered Hauwermeiren “a phased and dignified exit” because sacking him risked “potentially serious implications” for the charity's work and reputation.[97]
 Oxfam did not report any of the incidents to the Haitian authorities, because “it was extremely unlikely that any action would be taken”.[97] Although Oxfam disclosed details of the incident to the Charity Commission,  the Commission revealed after The Times investigation that it had never received Oxfam's final investigation report and Oxfam “did not detail the precise allegations, nor did it make any indication of potential sexual crimes involving minors”. A spokesperson for the Commission commented that: ""We will expect the charity to provide us with assurance that it has learnt lessons from past incidents"".[98] Oxfam later explained it had not given details to the Commission beyond ""inappropriate sexual behaviour"" because using prostitutes in Haiti was not illegal.[99]
 In response to the revelations, Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, described the reports as “shocking, sickening and depressing”. Oxfam issued a statement in which it asserted ""Oxfam treats any allegation of misconduct extremely seriously. As soon as we became aware of a range of allegations — including of sexual misconduct — in Haiti in 2011 we launched an internal investigation. The investigation was announced publicly and staff members were suspended pending the outcome.” The statement also added that the allegations “that under-age girls may have been involved were not proven”.[97]  Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said Oxfam had failed in its ""moral leadership"" over the ""scandal"". Mordaunt also said that Oxfam did ""absolutely the wrong thing"" by not reporting the detail of the allegations to the government.[100]  The incident led the International Development Committee of the UK Parliament to issue a scathing report about rampant sexual harassment and abuse in the humanitarian sector on July 31, 2018.
 Oxfam had been aware that Van Hauwermeiren while director of Oxfam's relief operation in Chad in 2006 and other staff had repeatedly used prostitutes at the Oxfam team house there, and that one of Oxfam's staff members had been fired for his behaviour.[101][102]  Oxfam's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence resigned, taking full responsibility and acknowledging that ""(c)oncerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon"".[102] New allegations were made by a senior staffer, Helen Evans, who had been the lead investigator of organizational sexual misconduct between 2012 and 2015.[103] A commentator in the medical journal Lancet argued the Oxfam sex scandal was not surprising.[104]
 In January 2013, Oxfam was nominated for the Charity of the Year award at the British Muslim Awards.[105]"
The Pew Charitable Trusts	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pew_Charitable_Trusts	"The Pew Charitable Trusts is an independent non-profit, non-governmental organization (NGO), founded in 1948.
 With over US $6 billion in assets, its stated mission is to serve the public interest by ""improving public policy, informing the public, and stimulating civic life"".[1]
 The Trusts, a single entity, is the successor to, and sole beneficiary of, seven charitable funds established between 1948 and 1979 by J. Howard Pew, Mary Ethel Pew, Joseph N. Pew, Jr., and Mabel Pew Myrin — the adult sons and daughters of Sun Oil Company founder Joseph N. Pew and his wife, Mary Anderson Pew. Honoring their parents' religious conviction that good works should be done quietly, the original Pew Memorial Foundation[2] was a grantmaking organization that made donations anonymously. The foundation became the Pew Memorial Trust in 1956, based in Philadelphia, the donors' hometown. Between 1957 and 1979, six other trusts were created, representing the personal and complementary philanthropic interests of the four siblings.[3][4] The Trusts continues to be based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with offices in Washington, D.C., London, and Brussels.
 Although today The Pew Charitable Trusts is non-partisan and non-ideological, Joseph Pew and his heirs were politically conservative. The modern day organization works to encourage responsive government and support scientific research on a wide range of issues, including global ocean governance, correction reform, and antibiotic resistance.
 Early priorities of the Pew Memorial Trust included cancer research, the American Red Cross, and a pioneering project to assist historically black colleges. Later beneficiaries included conservative organizations such as the John Birch Society, the American Liberty League, and the American Enterprise Institute, as well as environmental organizations such as the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Oceana, and mainstream think tanks like the center-left Brookings Institution.[5][6] The Trusts continues to fund charities in Philadelphia.
 In 2004, the Pew Trusts applied to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to change its status from private foundation to nonprofit organization.  Since the Pew's change to a charitable foundation, it can now raise funds freely and devote up to 5% of its budget to lobbying the public sector.
 According to the Pew Trusts's 2009 Annual Report, five of the twelve Directors serving on the Board are named Pew. Two of the five are physicians.[7]
 The Trusts' public policy areas include the environment, state policy, economic policy and health and human services.
 The Trusts, with other groups, backed an effort to create marine protected areas in the Pacific Ocean, near the Mariana Islands.[8] The protected area was officially designated in January 2009, and includes the Mariana Trench, the deepest ocean canyon in the world. Another marine protected area that the Trusts and other groups sought to protect is Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument which was protected by President Bush in 2006[9] and expanded by President Obama in 2016.[10]
 Pew's environmental portfolio is designed to help meet what they view as one of the seminal challenges of our time: saving the natural environment and protecting the rich array of life it supports.[11]
 The aim is to strengthen environmental policies and practices in ways that produce significant and measurable protection for terrestrial and marine systems worldwide. In doing so, Pew works to advance scientific understanding of the causes and consequences of environmental problems, design innovative policy solutions to these problems and mobilize public support for their implementation.
 Efforts are focused on reducing the scope and severity of three major global environmental problems:
 The Trusts also funds the Pew Research Center, the third-largest think tank in Washington, D.C., after the Brookings Institution and the Center for American Progress.
 The Trusts have worked closely with the Vera Institute of Justice on issues related to state correction policies in the Public Safety Performance Project.[12] In 2008, the Pew reported that more than one in 100 adults in the United States is in jail or prison, an all-time high. The cost to state governments is nearly $50 billion a year and the federal government $5 billion more.  The report compiled and analyzed data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and Federal Bureau of Prisons and each state's department of corrections.[13][14]
 Pew reported in 2009 that ""explosive growth in the number of people on probation or parole has propelled the population of the American corrections system to more than 7.3 million, or 1 in every 31 U.S. adults.""  ""One in 31: The Long Reach of American Corrections""[15] examined the scale and cost of prison, jail, probation and parole in each of the 50 states, and provides a blueprint for states to cut both crime and spending by reallocating prison expenses to fund stronger supervision of the large number of offenders in the community.
 ""Based on data, science, and non-partisan research, the Pew works to reduce hidden risks to the health, safety, and well-being of American consumers.""[16] One program, the Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences, is intended to support promising early and mid-career scientists investigating human health, both basic and clinical.[17] The awards provide flexible support ($240,000 over a four-year period). Grantees are encouraged to be entrepreneurial and innovative in their research.[18]
 The trust also helped fund the Gospel and Our Culture Network, which published books such as Missional Church: A vision for the sending of the Church in North America.[19]
 According to the 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements, as of 30 June 2017, the Trusts owned over US$6.6 billion in assets. For the 12 months ending on that date, total revenues were about US$384 million and total expenses were about $317 million, of which about $7 million were for fund raising expenses.[20]
 The Trusts have supported the relocation of the famed Barnes Art Collection from its longtime home in Lower Merion, PA, to Center City. This has been controversial in the art world. ""The Barnes Foundation was established by Albert C. Barnes in 1922 to 'promote the advancement of education and the appreciation of the fine arts. ... the Foundation is home to one of the world's largest collections of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and early Modern paintings, with extensive holdings by Picasso, Matisse, Cézanne, Renoir and Modigliani, as well as important examples of African sculpture."" [21]
 Opponents of relocating the collection to a new museum along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway said that move violates Barnes' will that the collection stay intact at its original location and not be loaned, transferred or sold. Columnist Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote in 2010, ""It is perfectly clear exactly what Barnes specified in his will. It was drawn up by the best legal minds. It is clear that what happened to his collection was against his wishes.""[22] Yet the Barnes Foundation prevailed in a series of legal actions and the new museum opened on May 16, 2012. At the opening Barnes trustee and treasurer Stephen Harmelin noted, ""There were financial challenges to be faced...questions about how the foundation as it existed could go on with its mission, worries about the safety and integrity of the collection in the long run,"" he said. ""We were convinced that the only change that could save the Barnes was to redouble our commitment to its mission, to reach out more widely than ever before, to build, to expand and to move the collection to a more accessible location.""[23]
 The Trusts became involved with the Barnes Collection when the foundation overseeing the art collection had serious financial trouble, ultimately contributing more than $20 million for a new museum. The New York Times' Roberta Smith said of the new building, ""Against all odds, the museum that opens to the public on Saturday is still very much the old Barnes, only better.""[24]
 The controversy involving Pew, other donors, the Barnes trustees and the collection was the subject of a documentary film The Art of the Steal. The Trusts did not participate in the film. Rebecca Rimel, head of The Pew Charitable Trusts, said they believed the film would not be fair.[25]
 Between 2011 and 2015, financial returns show the Pew Charitable Trusts gave $4.7 million to the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF).[26][27] The TPPF has a program called Fueling Freedom,[28] which seeks to ""explain the forgotten moral case for fossil fuels""[29] and is generally hostile to renewable energy, climate change action and environmental regulations.[30][31] Kathleen Hartnett White, President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality, is from the TPPF.[32]"
Pin-ups for Vets	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin-ups_for_Vets	"Pin-ups For Vets is a non-profit charitable organization dedicated to helping injured and ill American Soldiers, Marines, Airmen, Guards, and Sailors—and current active-duty personnel. The project is the work of Gina Elise who sells and distributes the Pin-ups For Vets Calendar, which hearkens back to 1940s and 1950-style vintage pretty-girl images. The calendars are considered very tasteful by today's standards; they contain no frontal nudity, or nudity of any kind. Elise appears in various types of period costume and lingerie. Several other women are involved in the project as models besides Elise. Some of these women have served in the U.S. Armed Forces themselves. To date, the organization has donated over $50,000 to veterans hospitals.
 Vintage hardware often features in Pin-ups For Vets photography, including old bikes, aircraft and military tanks. Elise also takes the time to travel to stateside military hospitals personally, delivering the calendars, posters, and T-shirts to wounded vets, soldiers, airmen, Marines, and seamen at their bedsides, and thanking them for their service.[1]
 Elise was awarded the Volunteer of the Year award by the Los Angeles Business Journal on May 5, 2009 (as part of the newspaper's ""Women Making a Difference"" award series). In November 2010, Gina was featured on an Oprah Winfrey Show episode honoring American volunteers.[2] Also in 2010, the movie Red (Bruce Willis and Helen Mirren, Summit Entertainment) featured Gina Elise in a scene showing her pin-up in a locker in the CIA headquarters.
 Elise has so far raised over $50,000 for rehab programs that have gone to military and VA hospitals, and in 2007 won the Outstanding Young Californian award from the Junior Chamber of Commerce and California Jaycees. Eight flags have been flown in honor of the ""Pin-ups For Vets"" calendar project on various military bases worldwide. Gina hopes to eventually visit a VA hospital in each of the fifty States."
Plan International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_International	"Plan International is an independent development and humanitarian organisation which works in 71 countries across the world, in Africa, the Americas, and Asia to advance children’s rights and equality for girls.[1]

 Plan International focuses on child protection, education, child participation, economic security, emergencies, health, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and water and sanitation. Plan International provides training in disaster preparedness, response and recovery, and has worked on relief efforts in countries including Haiti,[2] Colombia[3] and Japan.[4]
 Plan International also sponsors the Because I Am a Girl campaign, which is envisioned as a global movement to ensure girls everywhere can learn, lead, decide and thrive.
 Plan International was founded in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War by British journalist John Langdon-Davies and aid worker Eric Muggeridge. The organization was founded with the mission of protecting and promoting the rights of children. 
 The organisation was set up by British journalist John Langdon-Davies and refugee worker Eric Muggeridge in 1937, with the original aim to provide food, accommodation and education to children whose lives had been disrupted by the Spanish Civil War.[citation needed]
 Plan International's income comes from supporters who sponsor children and the remainder is raised through donations and grants. An average of 77% of this money goes directly to supporting Plan International’s development and humanitarian work.[6] The remainder is spent on fundraising initiatives and maintaining an international network of support staff. Plan International publishes annual reports detailing its fundraising and spending activity.[7]
 The organization receives funding to implement grants from a range of multilateral institutions, such as the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and other multilateral agencies.[8]
 Plan International adheres to several international standards and quality assurance mechanisms including the International Non-Governmental Organisations (INGO) Commitment to Accountability Charter[9] and the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief.[10]
 Anil Kapoor, who starred in Danny Boyle's film Slumdog Millionaire, is an
ambassador for Plan India.[11] He donated his entire fee for the movie to the NGO’s
Universal Birth Registration campaign.[12] Slumdog Millionaire stars Dev Patel and Freida Pinto were among cast members who attended a screening of the film at
Somerset House in London,[13] where over £2,000 was raised for Plan’s work in Mumbai, the setting of the film.
 In the U.S., notable celebrity endorsers associated with Plan International include Jacqueline Kennedy, David Elliot, Beau Bridges, Dina Eastwood, Scott Bakula,[14] and Nicholas D.

Ratanak International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratanak_International	"Ratanak International (previously The Ratanak Foundation) is a Christian charity founded by Brian McConaghy in 1989 that works exclusively in Cambodia helping the country rebuild after decades of revolution, civil war and genocide. Ratanak, which means 'precious gem' in Khmer, was an 11-month-old Cambodian baby that Brian McConaghy watched die as a result of a basic lack of medicine in a documentary he was shown in 1989. Since 1990 Ratanak has been working in Cambodia to help prevent such needless deaths. To help rebuild Cambodian society which the Khmer Rouge effectively dismantled in the 1970s, Ratanak has partnered on projects that have built schools, clinics and hospitals, opened orphanages, provided shelters for the elderly and AIDS victims, and initiated emergency programs in response to natural and man made disasters. In 2004, these projects plus many more continued, but the work of Ratanak also took on a whole new dimension as it begin partnering on projects that rescue, rehabilitate and reintegrate children sold into sexual slavery.[1][2]
 Based on the forensic and investigational experience of its founder, Brian McConaghy, Ratanak has become involved in assisting Canadian Law Enforcement in the investigation of Canadian pedophiles within Cambodia[3] and providing rehabilitation services to their victims.[4]
 Ratanak International partners with other NGOs on a large number of development projects in Cambodia, including a variety of programs associated with human trafficking prevention and child/woman abuse recovery.[5] Central to the work in Cambodia is a program whereby victims of sexual abuse and human trafficking are prepared (socially, educationally and emotionally) to re-enter society as healthy adults. For work in this field Ratanak International received the R.L. Petersen Award for Non-Profit Innovation in 2008.[6]
 The Vancouver Police Department and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have recognized Ratanak International for its assistance in international pedophile investigations.[7]
 Ratanak International is a Christian organisation,[8] that is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada,[9] and has sister organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia plus an operations office in Cambodia .[10]
 The Wilberforce Award, named after William Wilberforce, is given by Ratanak International to people who fight human trafficking.[11] Joy Smith, a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) in Manitoba, received the award in 2010 for making it her priority as an MP to expose the issue of human trafficking.[12] Brian McConaghy founded Ratanak International.[13] McConaghy is a forensic scientist who left the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in order to fight human trafficking.[14] Ride for Refuge has supported Ratanak International.[15]"
Realdania	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realdania	"Realdania is a private association in Denmark which supports projects in architecture and planning. It was established in 2000 following the sale of Realkredit Danmark to Danske Bank, when a fund of approximately 20 billion kroner (EUR 2.7 billion) was put aside for ""philanthropic"" purposes.[1] Realkredit Danmark was owned and controlled by its members (mortgage lenders), and this set-up was kept in Realdania.
 Realdania is often erroneously called a private charitable foundation, but Realdania's legal structure is that of an association operating as a business and not a foundation.[citation needed] Only owners of real estate in Denmark can become members of Realdania and participate in electing members of the board. Realdania has several subsidiaries. Realdania's closed structure has provoked criticism, and the association's funds has been called ""stray billions"" since they are controlled by a small network of people.[2][3]
 Its activity is concentrated on supporting projects in architecture and the built environment and is focused on three areas: cities, buildings and architectural heritage. The statutes of Realdania state that the association's purpose is to:
 It can be seen that investment activities predominate other ones, so that the avowed ""philanthropic"" or ""charitable"" nature of Realdania does not particularly stand out. At the end of 2011 Realdania's endowment stood at EUR 2.1 billion.
[5]
 Projects supported by Realdania include Bispebjerg Bakke, ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum in Aarhus[6] and the Brewery Site in Copenhagen, commissioned from Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas.[7] This last real estate development, the so-called ""Blox"" building including the Danish Architecture Centre, was inaugurated in 2018. Designed on the assumption that ""the city has become too calm and beautified,"" it has been criticized as a ""gloomy glass monolith.""[8]

 NGOs and/or cooperatives constitute most of the founding partners of the foundation: North American Reggio Emilia Alliance (NAREA; North America), Reggio Emilia Institutet (Sweden), Red Solare Argentina, Cooperativa Italiana di Ristorazione (CIR; Italy), Cooperativa Sociale Coopselios (Italy), and Fondazione Manodori (Italy).[6] Other partners are EFFE 2005 Gruppo Feltrinelli S.p.A, a private holding company for laeffe (an Italian television channel owned by the Feltrinelli media group), and the municipal/city council of Reggio Emilia (Comune di Reggio Emilia).
 The foundation states that its mission and aims include: recognising the potential and rights of children from birth; sharing the educational values of the Reggio Emilia approach through dialogue with other countries and experiences, promoting the Loris Malaguzzi International Centre (Centro Internazionale Loris Malaguzzi) as a place of research, innovation and experimentation; strengthening the educational experience offered by the partners, so that they continue to maintain the quality of their education services; respond to requests for exchange and collaboration; act as a motor for the development of research projects, with national and international partners, and; organizing and developing initiatives in the realm of solidarity and international cooperation in general.[7]
 There are three major projects/foci of the foundation."
REHASWISS	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REHASWISS	"The organisation REHASWISS was founded in 1977 by Joseph Aerthott,[1] a naturalised Swiss of Indian origin, along with few Swiss friends. The idea and goal behind the organisation is to help the disabled people in the third world, particularly on the Indian subcontinent. It is certified by ZEWO as a charity organisation and is authorized to use the ZEWO seal.[2]
 It is a politically and religiously neutral organisation. With the help of donations, membership contributions and patrons as well as contributions from the Swiss government, municipalities, churches and other institutions, it assists around 700 to 1000 disabled people every year in finding a self-supporting job and a livelihood. At present it is working in cooperation with around 25 NGOs in India and Bangladesh.[citation needed]"
Robert Bosch Stiftung	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bosch_Stiftung	"The Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (Robert Bosch Foundation), a charitable institution, is one of the leading private foundations of Europe that is known for its promotion of natural and social sciences, including public health and science, education, society and culture, and international relations. Established in 1964, the Robert Bosch Stiftung aims to advance the philanthropic and social endeavors of founder Robert Bosch (1861–1942).
 The Robert Bosch Stiftung is unique in that it owns Robert Bosch GmbH, one of Germany's largest companies. This charitable foundation holds a 92% stake in the share capital of Robert Bosch GmbH.[1] The foundation channels the share dividend it receives for charitable work exclusively, including to support general medical care, international understanding, social work, training and education.
 The non-profit foundation is both operative and grant-giving. In its activities, the foundation concentrates on six subject areas: Health, Science, Education, Society, International Relations – America and Asia and International Relations – Europe and its Neighbors.
 The foundation operates three facilities for health and research in Stuttgart: the Robert Bosch Hospital (Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus), the Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute for Clinical Pharmacology and the Institute for the History of Medicine, which houses the private papers of the founder of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann.
 The Robert Bosch Stiftung administrates three other foundations: the Hans Walz Stiftung, which funds naturopathic treatment, die Otto und Edith Mühlschlegel-Stiftung, whose funds are used for projects that deal with the topic of aging and enhancing the quality of life of the elderly and the DVA-Stiftung, which is a subsidiary of the Robert Bosch Stiftung since January 2005 and supports Franco-German relations in the fields of culture, literature and theatre.
 In 2014, the Robert Bosch Stiftung established the Berlin-based Robert Bosch Academy, a multidisciplinary institution that invites distinguished public intellectuals and thinkers from across the world to be Richard von Weizsäcker Fellows in Berlin.
 From 1964 to 2017, the foundation provided 1,6 billion euros in funding.[2] In 2017, it issued grants worth 100,5 million euros.[3] It is a member of the Network of European Foundations for Innovative Cooperation (NEF).[4]
 The foundation is involved in work to modernise the German healthcare system. In particular it is trying to develop more small health centres.[5]
 Each year, the Robert Bosch Stiftung issues three Co-Production Prizes for joint film productions by young German filmmakers and their partners from the Arab countries. Until 2015 the Prize was awarded to filmmakers from Germany and Eastern Europe.[6] Former participants were:
 Short Feature Film: I'll Go To War, But First Make Me Coffee
 Animation: Mango Manga
 Documentary: The Chosen Ones

Robert Wood Johnson Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wood_Johnson_Foundation	"The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) is the United States' largest philanthropy focused solely on health; it is based in Princeton, New Jersey.[1][2] The foundation's goal, through the use of grants, is ""to improve the health and health care of all Americans.""[3] The foundation has $11 billion in assets, generating grants approaching $500 million a year.[4]
 The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation makes grants for a range of health issues, including access to care, childhood obesity, and training for doctors and nurses. Other topics of interest to the foundation include social and economic factors that can impact health, including quality of housing, violence, poverty, and access to fresh food.[5]
 Robert Wood Johnson II built the family firm of Johnson & Johnson into the world's largest health products maker. He died in 1968. He established the foundation at his death with 10,204,377 shares of the company's stock.[6][7]
 The foundation is currently headed by Richard E. Besser, who was named president and CEO in April 2017.[8] Besser succeeded Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, the foundation's president between 2002 and 2017. Lavizzo-Mourey worked to advance its vision of building a Culture of Health,[9] including spearheading efforts to reverse the national childhood obesity epidemic. The foundation committed $1 billion toward eradicating this health problem,[10] dedicating $500 million to the mission in 2007 and another $500 million in 2015.
 From 1990 to 2002, Steve Schroeder lead the foundation, playing a major role in curbing tobacco use in the U.S., spending $446 million from 1991 to 2003 toward that goal.
 These interest areas include:
 Childhood Obesity: Backing projects that help reverse the childhood obesity epidemic by improving access to affordable, healthy food and providing more opportunities for children to play and exercise in their schools and communities. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's grants are focused on driving public policy initiatives and changing community environments. These include programs that encourage supermarkets to return to low-income communities and that improve nutrition, physical activity, and staff wellness in schools nationwide.  The foundation partnered with The Food Trust, a non-profit in Philadelphia that helps make fresh, affordable food accessible to the underprivileged and educates children about healthy eating. The Food Trust's research on childhood obesity led the Philadelphia school system to ban soda vending machines from all of its schools, the strongest measure in the country.[11]
 Health Insurance Coverage: Supporting policies and initiatives that expand health care coverage and increase enrollment in programs so that anyone in the U.S. can have affordable health care coverage.
 Health Care Cost, Quality, and Value: Promoting efforts to make high quality care available cost effectively. The foundation funds projects that study the relationships between the cost of care and results, develop ways to cut waste in the health care system, and advance research into how people's health is affected by factors such as education, transportation, income, clean air, and public or business policies. For example, in 2009, the foundation donated $2 million to Health Leads, a national health care organization that works with doctors in participating clinics to ""prescribe"" food, fuel assistance, housing vouchers, or other resources for their patients the same way they might prescribe medication.[12]
 Leadership for Better Health: Supporting projects that help health professionals develop leadership skills, encourage networking between different disciplines, and increase the diversity of people working in health care.
 Pioneer Portfolio: Making grants to promote approaches to entrenched problems, identify emerging health issues, and build new models for providing care. For example, the foundation gave nearly $5 million to Project ECHO, based at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. ECHO uses online videoconferencing to link primary-care doctors, nurses, and physicians' assistants with specialists to train them to treat and help manage complex conditions, such as hepatitis C and opiate addiction.[13]"
Rockefeller Brothers Fund	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Brothers_Fund	"The Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF) is a philanthropic foundation created and run by members of the Rockefeller family. It was founded in New York City in 1940 as the primary philanthropic vehicle for the five third-generation Rockefeller brothers: John D. Rockefeller III, Nelson, Laurance, Winthrop and David. It is distinct from the Rockefeller Foundation. The Rockefellers are an industrial, political, and banking family that made one of the world's largest fortunes in the oil business during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
 The Fund's stated mission is to ""advance social change that contributes to a more just, sustainable, and peaceful world.""[2] The current president of RBF is Stephen Heintz, who was appointed to the post in 2000.[3] Valerie Rockefeller serves as RBF's chairwoman. She succeeded Richard Rockefeller, the fifth child of David Rockefeller, who served as RBF's chairman until 2013.[4]
 The Rockefeller Brothers Fund was established in 1940 by the five sons of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. The five Rockefeller brothers served as the Fund's first five trustees. In 1951, the Fund grew substantially when it received a $58 million endowment from John D. Rockefeller, Jr.[5]
 As the RBF's founding generation passed on, new family members joined the board, moving the Fund's giving further to the political left.[6] In 1999, the Fund merged with the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation.[5]
 In November 2006, David Rockefeller pledged $225 million to the Fund that would create the David Rockefeller Global Development Fund after his death.[7]
 In September 2014, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund announced that it planned to divest its assets from fossil fuels.[8] On disinvesting from fossil fuels, the president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Stephen Heintz, said: ""We see this as both a moral imperative and an economic opportunity"" (30 September 2014).[9]
 The Rockefeller Family Fund and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund are independent, distinct institutions.[10]
 From 1956 to 1960, the Fund financed a study conceived by its then president, Nelson Rockefeller, to analyze the challenges facing the United States. Henry Kissinger was recruited to direct the project. Seven panels were constituted that looked at issues including military strategy, foreign policy, international economic strategy, governmental reorganization, and the nuclear arms race.[11]
 The military subpanel's report was rush-released about two months after the USSR launched Sputnik in October 1957.[12] Rockefeller urged the Republican Party to adopt the finding of the Special Studies Project as its platform. The findings of the project formed the framework of Nelson Rockefeller's 1960 presidential election platform.[13] The project was published in its entirety in 1961 as Prospect for America: The Rockefeller Panel Reports. The archival study papers are stored in the Rockefeller Archive Center at the family estate.[14]"
Rockefeller Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation	"The Rockefeller Foundation is a private foundation based at 420 Fifth Avenue, New York City.[3] It was established by the six-generation Rockefeller family. The Foundation was started by Standard Oil owner John D. Rockefeller (""Senior""), along with his son John D. Rockefeller Jr. (""Junior""), and Senior's principal oil and gas business and philanthropic advisor, Frederick Taylor Gates, in New York State on May 14, 1913, when its charter was formally accepted by the New York State Legislature.[4]
 As of 2015, the Foundation was ranked as the 39th largest U.S. foundation by total giving.[5] By year-end 2016 assets were tallied at $4.1 billion (unchanged from 2015), with annual grants of $173 million.[6]
 On January 5, 2017, the board of trustees announced the unanimous selection of Dr. Rajiv Shah to serve as the 13th president of the foundation.[7] Shah became the youngest person, at 43,[8] and first Indian-American to serve as president of the foundation.[9] He assumed the position March 1, succeeding Judith Rodin who served as president for nearly twelve years and announced her retirement, at age 71, in June 2016.[10] Rodin in turn had succeeded Gordon Conway in 2005. A former president of the University of Pennsylvania, Rodin was the first woman to head the foundation.[11]
 Rockefeller's interest in philanthropy and Public Relations began in 1904, influenced by Ida Tarbell's book published about Standard Oil crimes, The History of the Standard Oil Company, which prompted him to whitewash the Rockefeller image.[12][failed verification]
 His initial idea to set up a large-scale foundation occurred in 1901, but it was not until 1906 that Senior's famous business and philanthropic advisor, Frederick Taylor Gates, seriously revived the idea, saying that Rockefeller's fortune was rolling up so fast his heirs would ""dissipate their inheritances or become intoxicated with power"", unless he set up ""permanent corporate philanthropies for the good of Mankind"".[13]
 It was also in 1906 that the Russell Sage Foundation was established, though its program was limited to working women and social ills.  Rockefeller's would thus not be the first foundation in America (Benjamin Franklin was the first to introduce the concept), but it brought to it unprecedented international scale and scope. In 1909 he signed over 73,000 shares of Standard Oil of New Jersey, valued at $50 million, to the three inaugural trustees, Junior, Gates and Harold Fowler McCormick, the first installment of a projected $100 million endowment.[13]
 They applied for a federal charter for the foundation in the US Senate in 1910, with at one stage Junior even secretly meeting with President William Howard Taft, through the aegis of Senator Nelson Aldrich, to hammer out concessions.[citation needed] However, because of the ongoing (1911) antitrust suit against Standard Oil at the time, along with deep suspicion in some quarters of undue Rockefeller influence on the spending of the endowment, the end result was that Senior and Gates withdrew the bill from Congress in order to seek a state charter.[13]
 On May 14, 1913, New York Governor William Sulzer approved a state charter for the foundation – two years after the Carnegie Corporation – with Junior becoming the first president. With its large-scale endowment, a large part of Senior's fortune was insulated from inheritance taxes. The total benefactions of both him and Junior and their philanthropies in the end would far surpass Carnegie's endowments, his biographer Ron Chernow states, ranking Rockefeller as ""the greatest philanthropist in American history.""[13]
 The first secretary of the foundation was Jerome Davis Greene, the former secretary of Harvard University, who wrote a ""memorandum on principles and policies"" for an early meeting of the trustees that established a rough framework for the foundation's work. On December 5, the Board made its first grant of $100,000 to the American Red Cross to purchase property for its headquarters in Washington, D.C.[14] At the beginning the foundation was global in its approach and concentrated in its first decade entirely on the sciences, public health and medical education.
 It was initially located within the family office at Standard Oil's headquarters at 26 Broadway, later (in 1933) shifting to the GE Building (then RCA), along with the newly named family office, Room 5600, at Rockefeller Center; later it moved to the Time-Life Building in the Center, before shifting to its current Fifth Avenue address.
 In 1913 the foundation set up the International Health Commission (later Board), the first appropriation of funds for work outside the US, which launched the foundation into international public health activities. This expanded the work of the Sanitary Commission worldwide, working against various diseases in fifty-two countries on six continents and twenty-nine islands, bringing international recognition of the need for public health and environmental sanitation. Its early field research on hookworm, malaria, and yellow fever provided the basic techniques to control these diseases and established the pattern of modern public health services.[15]
 The Commission established and endowed the world's first school of Hygiene and Public Health, at Johns Hopkins University, and later at Harvard, and then spent more than $25 million in developing other public health schools in the US and in 21 foreign countries – helping to establish America as the world leader in medicine and scientific research. In 1913 it also began a 20-year support program of the Bureau of Social Hygiene, whose mission was research and education on birth control, maternal health and sex education.
 In the interwar years, the Foundation's support of public health, nursing, and social work in Eastern and Central Europe was a concentrated effort to advance medicine and create a global network of medical research.[16]  After the war, it sent a team to West Germany to investigate how it could become involved in reconstructing the country. They focused on restoring democracy, especially regarding education and scientific research, with the long-term goal of reintegrating Germany to the Western world.[17]
 In 1914, the foundation set up the China Medical Board, which established the first public health university in China, the Peking Union Medical College, in 1921; this was subsequently nationalised when the Communists took over the country in 1949. In the same year it began a program of international fellowships to train scholars at the world's leading universities at the post-doctoral level; a fundamental commitment to the education of future leaders.
 Also in 1914, the trustees set up a new Department of Industrial Relations, inviting William Lyon Mackenzie King to head it. He became a close and key advisor to Junior through the Ludlow Massacre, turning around his attitude to unions; however the foundation's involvement in IR was criticized for advancing the family's business interests.[18] The foundation henceforth confined itself to funding responsible organizations involved in this and other controversial fields, which were beyond the control of the foundation itself.[19]
 During the late-1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation created the Medical Sciences Division, which emerged from the former Division of Medical Education. The division was led by Dr. Richard M. Pearce until his death in 1930, to which Alan Gregg to succeeded him until 1945.[20] During this period, the Division of Medical Sciences was known for making large contributions to research across several fields of psychiatry. The 1930s was one of the most prominent decades in Rockefeller Foundation philanthropy to psychiatric research, as the foundation set a goal to find, train, and encourage scholars for research and practice.[21] One of the first large contributions from the Foundation to psychiatric research was in 1935, with the appropriation of $100000 to the Institute for Psychoanalysis in Chicago.[22] This grant was renewed in 1938, with payments extending into the early-1940s.[23]
 Through the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial (LSRM), established by Senior in 1918 and named after his wife, the Rockefeller fortune was for the first time directed to supporting research by social scientists. During its first few years of work, the LSRM awarded funds primarily to social workers, with its funding decisions guided primarily by Junior. In 1922, Beardsley Ruml was hired to direct the LSRM, and he most decisively shifted the focus of Rockefeller philanthropy into the social sciences, stimulating the founding of university research centers, and creating the Social Science Research Council. In January 1929, LSRM funds were folded into the Rockefeller Foundation, in a major reorganization.[24]
 Junior became the foundation chairman in 1917. One of the many prominent trustees of the institution since has been C. Douglas Dillon, the United States Secretary of the Treasury under both Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
 Beginning in 1930 the Rockefeller Foundation provided financial support to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics,[25] which later inspired and conducted eugenics experiments in the Third Reich.
 The Rockefeller Foundation funded Nazi racial studies even after it was clear that this research was being used to rationalize the demonizing of Jews and other groups. Up until 1939 the Rockefeller Foundation was funding research used to support Nazi racial science studies at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics (KWIA.) Reports submitted to Rockefeller did not hide what these studies were being used to justify, but Rockefeller continued the funding and refrained from criticizing this research so closely derived from Nazi ideology. The Rockefeller Foundation did not alert ""the world to the nature of German science and the racist folly"" that German anthropology promulgated, and Rockefeller funded, for years after the passage of the 1935 Nuremberg racial laws.[26]
 The Rockefeller Foundation, along with the Carnegie Institution, was the primary financier for the Eugenics Record Office, until 1939.
[27]
 The foundation also supported the early initiatives of Henry Kissinger, such as his directorship of Harvard's International Seminars (funded as well by the Central Intelligence Agency) and the early foreign policy magazine Confluence, both established by him while he was still a graduate student.[28]
 Through the years the foundation has expanded greatly in scope. Historically, it has given more than $14 billion in current dollars[29] to thousands of grantees worldwide and has assisted directly in the training of nearly 13,000 Rockefeller Fellows.
 Its overall philanthropic activity has been divided into five main subject areas:[30]
 In the 1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation started a program to eradicate hookworm in Mexico. The program exemplified the time period's confidence in science as the solution for everything.[31] This reliance on science was known as scientific neutrality. The Rockefeller Foundation program stated that there was a crucial correlation between the world of science, politics and international health policy. This heavy reliance of scientific neutrality contradicted the hookworm program's fundamental objective to invest in public health in order to develop better social conditions and to establish positive ties between the United States and Mexico.[32] The Hookworm Campaign set the terms of the relationship between Mexico and the Rockefeller Foundation that persisted through subsequent programs including the development of a network of local public health departments. The importance of the hookworm campaign was to get a foot in the door and swiftly convince rural people of the value of public health work. The roles of the RF's hookworm campaign are characteristic of the policy paradoxes that emerge when science is summoned to drive policy. The campaign in Mexico served as a policy cauldron through which new knowledge could be demonstrated applicable to social and political problems on many levels.[33]
 A major program beginning in the 1930s was the relocation of German (Jewish) scholars from German universities to America. This was expanded to other European countries after the Anschluss occurred; when war broke out it became a full-scale rescue operation. Another program, the Emergency Rescue Committee was also partly funded with Rockefeller money; this effort resulted in the rescue of some of the most famous artists, writers and composers of Europe. Some of the notable figures relocated or saved (out of a total of 303 scholars) by the Foundation were Thomas Mann, Claude Lévi-Strauss and Leó Szilárd, enriching intellectual life and academic disciplines in the US. This came to light afterwards through a brief, unpublished history of the Foundation's program.[34]
 Another significant program was its Medical Sciences Division, which extensively funded women's contraception and the human reproductive system in general. Other funding went into endocrinology departments in American universities, human heredity, mammalian biology, human physiology and anatomy, psychology, and the studies of human sexual behavior by Dr. Alfred Kinsey.[35]
 In 1950 the Foundation mounted a major program of virus research, establishing field laboratories in Poona, India; Port of Spain, Trinidad; Belém, Brazil; Johannesburg, South Africa; Cairo, Egypt; Ibadan, Nigeria; and Cali, Colombia.[citation needed] In time, major funding was also contributed by the countries involved, while in Trinidad the British government and neighbouring British-controlled territories also assisted. Sub-professional staff were almost all recruited locally and, wherever possible, local people were given scholarships and other support to be professionally trained. In most cases, locals eventually took over management of the facilities. Support was also given to research on viruses in many other countries. The result of all this research was the identification of a huge number of viruses affecting humans, the development of new techniques for the rapid identification of viruses, and a quantum leap in our understanding of arthropod-borne viruses.[36]
 In the arts it has helped establish or support the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada, and the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut; Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.; Karamu House in Cleveland, Ohio; and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York. In a recent shift[when?] in program emphasis, President Rodin eliminated the division that spent money on the arts, the creativity and culture program. One program that signals the shift was the foundation's support as the underwriter of Spike Lee's documentary on New Orleans, When the Levees Broke. The film has been used as the basis for a curriculum on poverty, developed by the Teachers College at Columbia University for their students.[37]
 Thousands of scientists and scholars from all over the world have received foundation fellowships and scholarships for advanced study in major scientific disciplines. In addition, the foundation has provided significant and often substantial research grants to finance conferences and assist with published studies, as well as funding departments and programs, to a vast range of foreign policy and educational organizations, including:[citation needed]
 The Rockefeller Foundation has accomplished some notable achievements, such as:
 The foundation also funded several infamous projects:
 Agriculture was introduced to the Natural Sciences division of the foundation in the major reorganization of 1928. In 1941, the foundation gave a small grant to Mexico for maize research, in collaboration with the then new president, Manuel Ávila Camacho. This was done after the intervention of vice-president Henry Wallace and the involvement of Nelson Rockefeller; the primary intention being to stabilise the Mexican Government and derail any possible communist infiltration, in order to protect the Rockefeller family's investments.[51]
 By 1943 this program, under the foundation's Mexican Agriculture Project, had proved such a success with the science of corn propagation and general principles of agronomy that it was exported to other Latin American countries; in 1956 the program was then taken to India; again with the geopolitical imperative of providing an antidote to communism.[51] It wasn't until 1959 that senior foundation officials succeeded in getting the Ford Foundation (and later USAID, and later still, the World Bank) to sign on to the major philanthropic project, known now to the world as the Green Revolution. It was originally conceived in 1943 as CIMMYT, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico. It also provided significant funding for the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. Part of the original program, the funding of the IRRI was later taken over by the Ford Foundation.[51]
 Costing around $600 million, over 50 years, the revolution brought new farming technology, increased productivity, expanded crop yields and mass fertilization to many countries throughout the world. Later it funded over $100 million of plant biotechnology research and trained over four hundred scientists from Asia, Africa and Latin America. It also invested in the production of transgenic crops, including rice and maize. In 1999, the then president Gordon Conway addressed the Monsanto Company board of directors, warning of the possible social and environmental dangers of this biotechnology, and requesting them to disavow the use of so-called terminator genes;[52] the company later complied.
 In the 1990s, the foundation shifted its agriculture work and emphasis to Africa; in 2006 it joined with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation[53] in a $150 million effort to fight hunger in the continent through improved agricultural productivity. In an interview marking the 100 year anniversary of the Rockefeller Foundation, Judith Rodin explained to This Is Africa that Rockefeller has been involved in Africa since their beginning in three main areas – health, agriculture and education, though agriculture has been and continues to be their largest investment in Africa.[54]
 The foundation also owns and operates the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center in Bellagio, Italy. The Center comprises several buildings, spread across a 50-acre (200,000 m2) property, on the peninsula between lakes Como and Lecco in Northern Italy. The Center is sometimes colloquially referred to as the Villa Serbelloni. The Villa is only one of the many buildings in which residents and conference participants are housed. The property was bequeathed to the Foundation in 1959 under the presidency of Dean Rusk (who was later to become U.S. President Kennedy's secretary of state).
The Bellagio Center operates both a conference center and a residency program.[55] The residency program is a highly competitive program to which scholars, artists, writers, musicians, scientists, policymakers and development professionals from around the world can apply to work on a project of their own choosing for a period of four weeks. The essence of the program is the synergy obtained by the interaction between people coming from the most diverse backgrounds.
Numerous Nobel laureates, Pulitzer winners, National Book Award recipients, Prince Mahidol Award winners and MacArthur fellows, as well as several acting and former heads of State and Government, have been in residence at Bellagio.
 The network is enabled by the Rockefeller Foundation for collaboration between experts and communication professionals that include grassroots/community-based and international non-governmental organizations, as well as multilateral and bilateral entities. Its involvement in AIDS prevention, was based on promoting deep-rooted social changes that stem from informed and inclusive public engagement. However, it recognized that wide-scale educational campaigns focused on altering individual behavior played a critical role.
 The strategy and principles linked with the network are listed below:
 In December 2013, The Rockefeller Foundation launched the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, which is dedicated to promoting urban resilience, defined as ""the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.""[57]
 Through its program, 100 Resilient Cities offers cities the following resources:[58]
 A total of 100 cities across six continents are part of the program, as of May 2016.[59] All 100 cities have developed individual City Resilience Strategies with technical support from a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO). The CRO ideally reports directly to the city's chief executive and helps coordinate all the resilience efforts in a single city.
 In January 2016, The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development announced winners of its National Disaster Resilience Competition (NDRC), awarding three 100RC member cities – New York, NY; Norfolk, VA; and New Orleans, LA – with more than $437 million in disaster resilience funding.[60] The grant was the largest ever received by the city of Norfolk.
 The Cultural Innovation Fund is a pilot grant program that is overseen by Lincoln Center for the Arts. The Rockefeller Foundation selected Lincoln Center to administer the fund based on the institutions steady track record in creating community based partnerships and implementing art based programs.[61][62] The grants are to be used towards innovative ideas that would bring art access and foster cultural opportunities in the underserved areas of Brooklyn and the South Bronx[63] with three overarching goals. 
 The Rockefeller family helped lead the foundation in its early years, but later limited itself to one or two representatives, to maintain the foundation's independence and avoid charges of undue family influence. These representatives have included the former president John D. Rockefeller 3rd, and then his son John D. Rockefeller, IV, who gave up the trusteeship in 1981. In 1989, David Rockefeller's daughter, Peggy Dulany, was appointed to the board for a five-year term.
 In October 2006, David Rockefeller, Jr. joined the board of trustees, re-establishing the direct family link and becoming the sixth family member to serve on the board. By contrast, the Ford Foundation has severed all direct links with the Ford family.[citation needed]
 Stock in the family's oil companies is a major part of the foundation's assets, beginning with Standard Oil and now with its corporate descendants, including Exxon Mobil.[64][65][66]
 The second-oldest major philanthropic institution in America, after the Carnegie Corporation, the foundation's impact on philanthropy in general has been profound. It has supported United Nations programs throughout its history, such as the recent First Global Forum On Human Development, organized by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1999.[67]
 The early institutions it set up have served as models for current organizations: the UN's World Health Organization, set up in 1948, is modeled on the International Health Division; the U.S. Government's National Science Foundation (1950) on its approach in support of research, scholarships and institutional development; and the National Institute of Health (1950) imitated its longstanding medical programs.[68]"
Rotary Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Foundation	"The Rotary Foundation is a non-profit corporation that supports the efforts of Rotary International to achieve world understanding and peace through international humanitarian, educational, and cultural exchange programs. It is supported solely by voluntary contributions from Rotarians and friends of the Foundation who share its vision of a better world.
 The Foundation was created in 1917 by Rotary International's sixth president, Arch C. Klumph, as an endowment fund for Rotary ""to do good in the world."" It has grown from an initial contribution of US$26.50 to more than US$1billion. It has one of the largest and most prestigious international fellowship programs in the world.
 PolioPlus:[1][2]Rotarians have mobilized by the hundreds of thousands to ensure that children are immunized against this crippling disease and that surveillance is strong despite the poor infrastructure, extreme poverty and civil strife of many countries. The Polio Plus program has been promoted by Sergio Mulitsch di Palmenberg President and founder of Rotary Club Treviglio e Pianura Bergamasca in Rome during the June 1979 3H Promotion convention.  Mulitsch, thanks to the 204 District Governo VALMIGI, began the fundraising and, thanks to the own professionally in packaging technology solved the temperature shipping issue,  starting the first immunization campaign in the Philippines on 1980.  Since the PolioPlus program’s inception in 1985 more than two billion children have received oral polio vaccine. To date, 209 countries, territories and areas around the world are polio-free. As of January 2012, India was declared polio free for the first time in history, leaving just Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan with endemic polio.[3]  As of June 2011, Rotary has committed more than US$850 million[4] to global polio eradication. Rotary has received $355 million in challenge grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation: Rotary committed to raising $200 million by June 30, 2012 and met that goal by January 2012. This represents another $555 million toward polio eradication.[5]
 PolioPlus Fund:[6] Grants supported out of the PolioPlus Fund that are primarily geared towards national level and supra-national efforts. For example, National PolioPlus Committee chairs or a major partner agency, such as the World Health Organization or UNICEF may apply for these funds.[7] Support is available for eradication efforts in polio-endemic, recently endemic, and high-risk countries, including National Immunization Days, poliovirus transmission monitoring, and other activities.[5]
 PolioPlus Partners is a program that allows Rotarians to participate in the polio eradication effort by contributing to specific social mobilization and surveillance activities in polio-endemic countries. In 2003–2004, grants were approved in Africa and South Asia for a total of $330,000.
 Disaster Recovery:[8] Facilitates club efforts to support disaster preparedness and recovery.
 District Simplified Grants:[9] Support for short-term service activities or humanitarian endeavors of districts in communities locally or internationally. This program began in 2003–2004 and, projects in 44 countries at a cost of US$5.2 million were awarded.
 Health, Hunger and Humanity (3-H) Grants:[10] Support for large-scale, two- to four-year projects that improve health, alleviate hunger, or promote human development. Since 1978, projects in 74 countries have been funded at a cost of US$74 million. As of 1 July 2009, the Foundation will no longer award 3-H grants, with the exception of projects being developed to support water and sanitation projects in Ghana, the Philippines, and the Dominican Republic.
 3-H Planning Grants: Support for the planning activities of Rotary clubs and districts designing 3-H projects of a significant size and impact. Also in moratorium in conjunction with 3-H Grants program.
 Matching Grants:[11] – Provide matching funds for the international service projects of Rotary clubs and districts. Since 1965, more than 20,000 Matching Grants projects in 166 countries have been funded at a cost of more than US$198 million.
 Scholarships:
[12] Founded in 1947, the Ambassadorial Scholarships program was the largest non-governmental and most international scholarship program in the world. Scholars studied in a country other than their own where they serve as unofficial ambassadors of goodwill. Over 37,000 scholars from some 110 countries received scholarships at a cost of almost US$446 million. The program ended in 2013. Scholarships are now funded by district and global grants and are offered directly through Rotary clubs.
 Group Study Exchange (GSE):[13] These annual awards are made to paired Rotary districts to provide travel expenses for a team of non-Rotarians from a variety of vocations. Rotarian hosts organize a four- to six-week itinerary of educational and cultural points of interest. Since 1965, almost 48,000 individuals in more than 11,000 teams from more than 100 countries have participated at a cost of US$85 million.
 Rotary Peace Fellowships:[14] Up to 100 fellows are selected every year in a globally competitive process based on personal, academic, and professional achievements. Fellows earn a master’s-level degree or a professional development certificate in peace and conflict studies at one of six Rotary Peace Centers at leading universities in Australia, England, Sweden, Japan, the United States and Thailand.
 Rotary Grants for University Teachers: Awarded to faculty members to teach in a developing nation for three to ten months. Since 1985, 377 university teachers have shared their expertise with a college or university in a developing country. As of 1 July 2009, the Foundation has discontinued this program."
Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Doctor_Service_of_Australia	"The Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia (RFDS, informally known as The Flying Doctor) is one of the largest and most comprehensive aeromedical organisations in the world. It provides emergency and primary health care services for those living in rural, remote and regional areas of Australia. It is a non-profit organisation which provides health care to people who cannot access a hospital or general practice due to the vast distances of the Outback.
 The Reverend John Flynn had worked in rural and remote areas of Victoria and was commissioned by the Presbyterian Church to look at the needs of Outback people. His report to the Presbyterian Assembly in 1912 resulted in the establishment of the Australian Inland Mission (AIM),[1] of which he was appointed Superintendent. In 1928, he formed the AIM Aerial Medical Service,[2] a one-year experiment based in Cloncurry, Queensland. This experiment later became The Royal Flying Doctor Service.
 Flynn's missionary work involved the establishment of hospitals in bush communities. This, however, did not help those who lived far from any major community. In his public speaking he would often retell the tragic circumstances that had befallen several bush settlers. The fate of Jimmy Darcy, in 1917, was one of these stories.
 It was from stories such as this that Flynn, and his following at the AIM, became inspired to develop a route of communications that could solve the problem of remoteness. However, no feasible technology seemed apparent.
 Victorian pilot Lieutenant (John) Clifford Peel had heard Flynn's public speeches, and on being shipped out to France for World War I in 1917, sent Flynn a letter explaining how he had seen a missionary doctor visiting isolated patients using a plane. Assisted by costing estimates by Peel, Flynn immediately took the idea of using aircraft to begin his idea, and published Peel's idea in the church's newsletter. Peel died in combat in September 1918, probably not even knowing the impact he had in the creation of an Australian icon.[3]
 Along with motorised flight, another new technology was being developed that could replace the complicated means of communication by telegraph. Together with Alfred Traeger, Flynn began experiments with radio in the mid-1920s to enable remote outposts to contact a centralised medical base. The pedal radio was the first result of this collaboration. These were distributed gradually to stations, missions and other human residences around Cloncurry, the base site for a 50-watt transmitter.
 Experimental aerial medical services commenced in 1926 and an injured miner was transported by air from Mount Isa to Cloncurry in November 1927.[4]
 By 1928, Flynn had gathered sufficient funds through fundraising activities to launch the experiment of the AMS on 15 May. Its supporters included industrialist HV McKay, medical doctor George Simpson, and Hudson Fysh, one of the founders of Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services, the company which would go on to become Qantas. Qantas supplied the first aircraft to the fledgling organisation, VH-UER a De Havilland DH.50, dubbed ""Victory"". On 17 May 1928,[5] two days after inception, the service's first official flight piloted by Arthur Affleck departed from Cloncurry, 85 miles to Julia Creek in Central Queensland, where the plane was met by over 100 people at the airstrip. Qantas charged two shillings per mile for use of the Victory during the first year of the project.[5]
 Within the first year of operations, the service flew approximately 20,000 miles in 50 flights, becoming the first comprehensive air ambulance service in the world.[6] The service persisted through difficult first years, dealing with postwar Australia and the Great Depression of the 1930s. During its first few decades the service relied heavily on community fundraising, volunteer support and donations. Nowadays, the service is supported by the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, but still relies heavily on fundraising and donations from the community to purchase and medically equip its aircraft, and to finance other major capital initiatives. Until the 1960s the service predominantly hired aircraft, pilots and service technicians from contractors. After this point, the service moved on to purchasing its own equipment and employing its own pilots and mechanics.
 In 1932, the success from its operations in Cloncurry, and the increasing public awareness to this vital rural service, resulted in a push for a national network of flying doctors, hopefully with sponsorship from the government. In 1934 this was realised with the new Australian Aerial Medical Service opening up ""Sections"" across the nation. Bases were set up in Wyndham, Port Hedland, Kalgoorlie, Broken Hill, Alice Springs and Meekatharra. The Queensland experiment was expanded with two additional bases opening in Charters Towers and Charleville. An official Federal Council for the organisation was formed in 1936. In 1937, Dr Jean White became the first female flying doctor in Australia, and the world, when she started work at Normanton.[7] In 1942 the service was again renamed as the Flying Doctor Service, with Royal being bestowed upon the service in 1955. On 22 October 1958, Holden car manufacturers donated their 500,000th vehicle to the service in Melbourne.
 Sister Myra Blanch was one of the first nurses, known as ""Flying Sisters"", to join the service. She was key in the New South Wales Section operations during the 1940s and 50s, even though Flying Nurses didn't actually become regular until the 1960s. Many patient transports are conducted with an RFDS nurse and pilot only on board. Nurses have been responsible for many innovations to the service, including an addition to the RFDS medical chest to incorporate a ""body chart"" (1951). The chart was an anatomical representation of a human being, with areas clearly numbered. With such a chart, a remote doctor can ask the patient ""where is the pain felt?"" and receive a comprehensible reply. The medicines contained in the chest are similarly numbered for ease in communicating medical instructions.
 The service is still heavily reliant on community support for funding, and is well respected across the country as an organisation that has contributed much to rural, regional and remote communities.[8]
 Its services include:[9]
 The service also uses not just aircraft but also four-wheel drives and other utility land vehicles to aid in transportation and communications.
 The RFDS is made up of seven legal entities – RFDS of Australia, Central Operations, Queensland Section, South Eastern Section, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Operations. The RFDS operates in a federated structure and each of the seven entities has its own Board and Management. Each entity operates independently, both financially and operationally.[11]
 The Flying Doctor operates from numerous bases, health services and other facilities (including marketing, fundraising and public relations as well as the national office) across Australia.[12]
 RFDS Bases are operated by:
 Bases at Carnarvon, Geraldton, Derby, and Wyndham have closed, while the original base at Cloncurry was moved to Mount Isa in 1965 and the early base at Charters Towers moved to Cairns in 1972. The most recent new base was opened in Broome in 2016.
 The first aircraft operated by the ""Aerial Medical Service"" in 1928 was a de Havilland DH.50 hired from the fledgling Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Service (Qantas). It was replaced in 1934 by a DH.83 Fox Moth.[5]
 During the 1930s and 1940s the fleet consisted of a mix of de Havilland DH.50s, DH.83 Fox Moths, DH.84 Dragons, DH.104 Doves and the de Havilland Australia DHA-3 Drover.
 From the 1950s to 1970s, the fleet included the Beechcraft Baron, Beechcraft Travel Air, Beechcraft Queen Air, Beechcraft Duke, Cessna 180, Cessna 182, Cessna 421, Piper Cherokee and Piper PA-31 Navajo.
 Aircraft were provided by contractors until the 1960s. Subsequently, the RFDS owned its own aircraft and employed its own pilots and engineers.
 In the 1970s and 1980s the RFDS base at Broken Hill operated the Australian-made GAF Nomad.
 From the 1980s to 2000s, the fleet included the Cessna 404 and Cessna 441.[8]
 For a time in the mid-2000s the aeromedical evacuation aircraft used were either the Pilatus PC-12 or the Beechcraft King Air 200 series. The internal configuration of these two aircraft varies in the different RFDS sections. Typically they are configured with two rear-facing seats which look onto two stretchers. In some aircraft, one stretcher can be removed quickly and two seats slipped into place instead.
 Both the PC-12 and King Air are pressurised and so can be used to safely transport patients who would not otherwise tolerate the decreased atmospheric pressures involved in non-pressurised aircraft. By flying at a lower altitude than usual, the internal cabin pressure can be maintained throughout the flight at sea level. This is important for patients critically sensitive to pressure changes.
 In addition, pressurised aircraft can fly at a sufficiently high altitude to be above turbulent weather conditions. This is of great benefit in providing an environment safe for the patient and staff, and also limits complications of aeromedical transport such as motion sickness and exacerbation of injuries such as unstable fractures.
 In October 2009 the standardisation on the two aircraft types ended when two Cessna 208B Grand Caravans and a Hawker 800XP[13][14] joined the fleet.
 The South Eastern Section operates 18 King Airs (9 B200, 7 B200C and 2 B300C); the Queensland Section operates 16 King Airs (8 B200, 6 B200C and 2 B200SE), 3 PC-12s and the 2 Grand Caravans; Western Operations operates 15 PC-12s and the Hawker 800XP; and Central Operations operates a PC-12 fleet numbering 14 aircraft.[15]
 In early 2019, The RFDS have so far received all of their 3 Pilatus PC-24 jets, which will be replacing their Hawker 800XP jet. They are based at Jandakot Airport and made a debut at the Avalon Air Show 2019. The PC-24 can fit 3 stretcher beds and 4 doctors. The aircraft can cruise at 45,000 feet (14,000 m) and halves the time of flight compared to the existing propeller driven fleet. The PC-24 can also operate out of paved and unpaved runways. The RFDS have purchase rights for 1 more aircraft. [16]
 The RFDS uses a wide range of contemporary emergency medical equipment to provide aeromedical retrieval services.[8] These include transport ventilators, critical care monitors, infusion devices, point-of-care testing, portable diagnostic ultrasound and a range of other splints and devices.[17]
 According to the RFDS of Australia 2015/16 Annual Report[15] the service owns 67 aircraft, and operates 23 bases with 1,225 employees.
Each day, on average, the service:
 The School of the Air, which links outback students with centralised teachers, until recently used the same radio equipment as the RFDS. This has been superseded with the availability of internet services.
 Notable people associated with the RFDS include:
 The First and Second Australian Inland Mission Hospitals in Birdsville are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.[24][25]
 In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Royal Flying Doctor Service was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an iconic ""innovation and invention"".[26]
 In 2011 the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia (Queensland Section) was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in recognition of its iconic contribution to rural health and rural community building in Australia through exceptional standards of service and innovation.[27]"
Royal London Society for Blind People	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_London_Society_for_Blind_People	"The Royal London Society for Blind People (RLSB) was a UK charity that has existed for 175 years to help blind and partially sighted young people in London and the South East through a blend of sports, education, and creative and developmental services.[1]
 On 1 January 2017, the Royal Society for Blind Children (RSBC) and Royal London Society for Blind People (RLSB) joined together to create a charity in England & Wales under the name of the Royal Society for Blind Children.
 On 12 January 1838, Thomas Lucas established The London Society for Teaching the Blind to Read in the city of London, where he introduced his Lucas Type, an early form of embossed text.
 Funds for the school were raised largely through the efforts of the Ladies' Committee under the secretaryship of Mrs Lydia Johnson. Her husband, Percival Norton Johnson, founder of what is now Johnson Matthey plc, also took a prominent role in the affairs of the Society for many years.
 Over the years the school slowly expanded, moving to locations across London, before heading to Aylesbury during World War II and eventually Seal in Kent. A college and nursery were later established to allow RLSB to reach out to more young people.
 To help vision impaired people gain employment, RLSB also ran a home workers scheme and workshops through the 1900s to allow people to learn a trade and find work.
 RLSB continued evolved and expanded to meet new needs of vision impaired young people.  Supporters and donors have included the Royal family, playwright J. B. Priestley and Charlie Chaplin.
 On 1 January 2017, the Royal Society for Blind Children (RSBC) and Royal London Society for Blind People (RLSB) joined together to create a charity in England & Wales under the name of the Royal Society for Blind Children.
 The original day school opened in Fitzroy Street, London, on 12 January 1839.  In 1840, it moved to a larger premises in 6 Gloucester Place, where resident pupils were accepted. In 1842, the organisation moved to larger premises in Bloomsbury; in 1847, a purpose-built school in Swiss Cottage was completed at a cost of £4,500.
 In 1938, the RLSB's 100th anniversary year, the prefix 'Royal' was added to the Society's title by order of HM King George VI; it became the 'Royal London Society for Teaching the Blind to Read'.
 At the start of World War II, the children were evacuated from London to a large manor house in Buckinghamshire called 'Dorton House'.
 In 1954, the Society purchased 'Wildernesse' in Seal and it became the new permanent home of the School. The name 'Dorton House' was transferred to the new property and the school was officially opened in 1956.  The RLSB's purpose-built Dorton House School was opened by the Duchess of Gloucester in 1983. Costing £1.75 million to build, it was designed for the education of 140 pupils.
 In 1989, the Queen opened Dorton's College of Further Education; in 1996, a purpose-built nursery was opened.  In 2009, Hollybank Farm was officially opened by the Duchess of Gloucester at Dorton House Campus in Seal.  In 2010, Tom Pey joined the RLSB as their Chief Executive Officer.
 RLSB conducts an education initiative called Learning and Living with Dorton, which allows young people to continue their education in a semi-independent living environment, accessing a post 16 curriculum in a nearby mainstream college, augmented with specialist support.  Students live in one of RLSB's community houses in London and the south-east.
 RLSB partners with local further education colleges to support students to access a wider range of courses, combined with elements of RLSB's JIGSAW Curriculum (a skills for independent living curriculum) in their community living setting.
 RLSB runs a network for blind and partially sighted young people called RLSB Connections, through which they can access a range of opportunities.
 Working across all London Boroughs, RLSB provides support people who are blind or partially sighted find employment.  The organisation also works with employed people who have concerns over their deteriorating eyesight, helping them continue to work in an effective manner, as well as identifying employment opportunities for clients and provide training and support services to help employers better meet the needs of
their blind and partially sighted employees and customers.
 RLSB maintains a programme called Sport Without Limits, intended to give visually impaired young people aged 8–25 the chance to experience a range of sporting activities including cricket, football, tennis, goalball, athletics, judo and even rock climbing.  The programme features activity days that take place across London, Kent and Sussex.
 RLSB also works with teachers and teaching assistants in mainstream education, attempting to equip them with the skills they need to work with blind and visually impaired young people"
Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_for_the_Prevention_of_Cruelty_to_Animals	"The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) is a charity operating in England and Wales that promotes animal welfare. In 2017, the RSPCA investigated 141,760 cruelty complaints and secured 1,492 convictions. The charity also rescued and collected 114,584 animals, carried out 222,664 microchippings and rehomed 44,611 animals.[2] Founded in 1824, it is the oldest and largest animal welfare organisation in the world[3] and is one of the largest charities in the UK.[4] The organisation also does international outreach work across Europe, Africa and Asia.[5]
 The charity's work has inspired the creation of similar groups in other jurisdictions, starting with the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (founded in 1836), and including the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1839), the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1840), the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1866), the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (1882), and various groups which eventually came together as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Australia (1981), the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Hong Kong) (1997) — formerly known as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Hong Kong) (1903–1997).
 The RSPCA is funded primarily by voluntary donations. In 2017, RSPCA total income was £140,900,000 and total expenditure was £129,400,000.[6] Its patron is Queen Elizabeth II.
 The emergence of the RSPCA has its roots in the intellectual climate of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century in Britain where opposing views were exchanged in print concerning the use of animals. The harsh use and maltreatment of animals in hauling carriages, scientific experiments (including vivisection), and cultural amusements of fox-hunting, bull-baiting and cock fighting were among some of the matters that were debated by social reformers, clergy, and parliamentarians.[7] At the beginning of the nineteenth century there was an unsuccessful attempt by William Johnstone Pulteney on 18 April 1800 to pass legislation through England's Parliament to ban the practice of bull-baiting.[8] In 1809 Lord Erskine (1750–1823) introduced an anti-cruelty bill which was passed in the House of Lords but was defeated in a vote in the House of Commons.[9] Erskine in his parliamentary speech combined the vocabulary of animal rights and trusteeship with a theological appeal to biblical passages opposing cruelty.[10] A later attempt to pass anti-cruelty legislation was spearheaded by the Irish-born parliamentarian Richard Martin and in 1822 an anti-cruelty to cattle bill (sometimes called Martin's Act) became law.[11]
 Martin's Act was supported by various social reformers who were not parliamentarians and an informal network had gathered around the efforts of Reverend Arthur Broome (1779–1837) to create a voluntary organisation that would promote kindness toward animals. Broome canvassed opinions in letters that were published or summarised in various periodicals in 1821.[12] Broome organised a meeting and extended invitations to various reformers that included parliamentarians, clergy and lawyers. The meeting was held on Wednesday 16 June 1824 in Old Slaughter's Coffee House, London. The meeting was chaired by Thomas Fowell Buxton MP (1786–1845) and the resolution to establish the society was voted on. Among the others who were present as founding members were Sir James Mackintosh MP, Richard Martin, William Wilberforce, Basil Montagu, John Ashley Warre, Rev. George Bonner, Rev. George Avery Hatch, Sir James Graham, John Gilbert Meymott, William Mudford, and Lewis Gompertz.[13] The organisation was founded as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Broome was appointed as the society's first honorary secretary.[14] The foundation is marked by a plaque on the modern day building at 77–78 St Martin's Lane.[15]
 The society was the first animal welfare charity to be founded in the world.[16] In 1824 it brought sixty three offenders before the courts.[17] It was granted its royal status by Queen Victoria in 1840 to become the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, as it is today.[18] The origins of the role of the RSPCA inspector stem from Broome's efforts in 1822 to personally bring to court some individuals against whom charges of cruelty were heard.[19] Broome employed and personally paid the salary for an inspector to monitor the abuse of animals at the Smithfield Market.[20] The inspector hired by Broome, Charles Wheeler, served in the capacity of an inspector from 1824–1826 but his services were terminated when the society's revenue was exceeded by its debts. The accrued debts led to a suspension of operations when Broome as the society's guarantor for debts was imprisoned.[21] When operations resumed there was some divided opinions in the Committees that steered the society about employing inspectors, which resulted in a resolution in 1832 to discontinue employing an inspector. The permanent appointment of a salaried inspector was settled in 1838, and the inspector is the image best known of the organisation today.[22]
 Broome's experience of bankruptcy and prison created difficulties for him afterwards and he stood aside as the society's first secretary in 1828 and was succeeded by the co-founding member Lewis Gompertz.[23] Unlike the other founder members who were Christians, Gompertz was a Jew and despite his abilities in campaigning against cruelty, fund-raising and administrative skills, tensions emerged between him and another committee member. The tensions led to the convening of a meeting in early 1832 which led to Gompertz resigning.[24] His resignation coincided with a resolution adopted in 1832 that ""the proceedings of the Society were entirely based on the Christian faith and Christian principles.""[25]
 Alongside the society's early efforts to prosecute offenders who maltreated animals, there were efforts made to promote kindly attitudes toward animals through the publication of books and tracts as well as the fostering of annual sermons preached against cruelty on behalf of the society. The first annual anti-cruelty sermon that was preached on behalf of the society was delivered by Rev Dr Rudge in March 1827 at the Whitechapel Church.[26] In 1865 the RSPCA looked for a way to consolidate and further influence public opinion on animal welfare by encouraging an annual ""Animal Sunday"" church service where clergy would preach sermons on anti-cruelty themes and the very first sermon was delivered in London on 9 July 1865 by Rev. Arthur Penryhn Stanley (1815–1881), the Dean of Westminster.[27] The ""Animal Sunday"" service became an annual event in different church gatherings in England, which was later adopted by churches in Australia and New Zealand in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and it was the forerunner of the ""pet blessing"" services that emerged in the 1970s.[28] In the twentieth century the RSPCA widened the horizons in the public domain by promoting an annual ""animal welfare week.""[29]
 The RSPCA also had annual accounts published in newspapers, like The Londoner, where the secretary would discuss improvements, report cases, and remind the public to watch over their animals' health.[30]
 
During the second half of 1837 the society sponsored an essay-writing competition with a benefactor offering a prize of one hundred pounds for the winning entry. The terms of the competition stipulated: ""The Essay required is one which shall morally illustrate, and religiously enforce, the obligation of man towards the inferior and dependent creatures--their protection and security from abuse, more especially as regards those engaged in service, and for the use and benefit of mankind-on the sin of cruelty--the infliction of wanton or unnecessary pain, taking the subject under its various denominations-exposing the specious defence of vivisection on the ground of its being for the interests of science--the supplying the infinite demands on the poor animal in aid of human speculations by exacting extreme labour, and thereby causing excessive suffering--humanity to the brute as harmonious with the spirit and doctrines of Christianity, and the duty of man as a rational and accountable creature.""[31]
 There were thirty-four essays submitted and in December 1838 the prize was awarded to the Congregational minister Rev John Styles.[32] Styles published his book-length work, The Animal Creation; its claims on our humanity stated and enforced, and all proceeds of sale were donated to the society.[33] Other contestants, such as David Mushet and William Youatt, the society's veterinarian, also published their essays.[34] One entrant whose work was submitted a few days after the competition deadline, and which was excluded from the competition was written by the Unitarian minister William Hamilton Drummond and he published his text in 1838, The Rights of Animals: and Man's Obligation to Treat Them with Humanity.[35] This competition set a precedent for subsequent RSPCA prize-winning competitions.
 The role of women in the society began shortly after the organisation was founded. At the society's first annual meeting in 1825, which was held at the Crown and Anchor Tavern on 29 June 1825, the public notice that announced the gathering specifically included appropriate accommodation for the presence of women members.[36] Several women of social standing were listed as patronesses of the society, such as the Duchess of Buccleuch, Dowager Marchioness of Salisbury, Dowager Countess Harcourt, Lady Emily Pusey, Lady Eyre and Lady Mackintosh.[37] In 1837 the novelist Catherine Grace Godwin (1798–1845) described in her novel Louisa Seymour an incident where two leading female characters were aghast at the behaviour of a driver abusing a horse pulling a carriage that they subsequently discussed the problem of cruelty with other characters one of whom, called Sir Arthur Beauchamp, disclosed that he was a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.[38] In 1839 another female supporter of the society, Sarah Burdett, a relative of the philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts and a poet, published her theological understanding of the rights of animals.[39] However it was not until 12 July 1870 that the RSPCA Ladies' Committee was established.[40] Through the Ladies Committee various activities were sponsored including essay-prize competitions among children, and the formation of the Band of Mercy as a movement to encourage children to act kindly toward animals.[41]
 In the nineteenth century the RSPCA fostered international relations on the problem of cruelty through the sponsoring of conferences and in providing basic advice on the establishment of similar welfare bodies in North America and in the colonies of the British Empire.[42] The RSPCA celebrated its jubilee in June 1874 by holding an International Congress on Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Queen Victoria delivered a letter of congratulations to the RSPCA on its anniversary.[43] Although the society was founded by people who were mostly Christian social reformers, and in 1832 presented itself as a Christian charity concerned with welfare as well as moral reform, the RSPCA gradually developed into a non-religious, non-sectarian animal welfare charity.[44]
 The RSPCA lobbied Parliament throughout the nineteenth century, resulting in a number of new laws. The Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 amended Martin's Act and outlawed baiting. There was a public groundswell of opinions that were divided into opposing factions concerning vivisection, where Charles Darwin (1809–1882) campaigned on behalf of scientists to conduct experiments on animals while others, such as Frances Power Cobbe (1822–1904) formed an anti-vivisection lobby.[45] The stance adopted by the RSPCA was one of qualified support for legislation.[46] This qualified support for experiments on animals was at odds with the stance taken by Society's founder Broome who had in 1825 sought medical opinions about vivisection and he published their anti-vivisection sentiments.[47] It was also a departure from the 1837 essay-competition (discussed above) where the essayists were obliged to expose ""the specious defence of vivisection on the ground of its being for the interests of science."" In 1876 the Cruelty to Animals Act was passed to control animal experimentation. In 1911 Parliament passed Sir George Greenwood's Animal Protection Act. Since that time the RSPCA has continued to play an active role, both in the creation of animal welfare legislation and in its enforcement. An important recent new law has been the Animal Welfare Act 2006.[48][49]
 During the First World War the RSPCA provided support for the Army Veterinary Corps in treating animals such as donkeys, horses, dogs and birds that were co-opted into military service as beasts of burden, messengers and so forth.[50] The RSPCA's centenary in 1924 and its one hundred and fiftieth anniversary in 1974 were accompanied by books telling the society's story.[51] Since the end of the Second World War the development of intense agricultural farming practices has raised many questions for public debate concerning animal welfare legislation and the role of the RSPCA. This development has included debates both inside the RSPCA (e.g. the RSPCA Reform Group) as well as among ethicists, social activists and supporters of claims for animal rights outside of it concerning the society's role in ethical and legal issues involving the use of animals.[52]
 RSPCA centres, hospitals and branches operate throughout England and Wales. In 2012 RSPCA centres and branches assisted and rehomed 55,459 animals.[53]
 In 2013 the society owned four animal hospitals, Birmingham, Greater Manchester, Putney (south London) and the Harmsworth Memorial Hospital in Holloway (north London),[54] and a number of clinics which provide treatments to those who could not otherwise afford it, neuter animals and accept animals from the RSPCA inspectorate.
 RSPCA animal centres deal with a wide range of injured and rescued animals, working alongside its inspectorate, volunteers, and others to ensure that each animal is found a new home. There are currently 17 RSPCA animal centres across the UK and a further 42 centres ran independently by Branches.[55]
 In 2013 the society had four wildlife centres at East Winch (Norfolk), West Hatch (Somerset), Stapeley Grange (Cheshire) and Mallydams Wood (East Sussex), which provide treatment to sick, injured and orphaned wild animals to maximise their chances of a successful return to the wild.[56]
 
 At the national level, there is a 'National Control Centre', which receives all calls from members of the public, and tasks local Inspectors, some information AWOs or ACOs to respond to urgent calls.[57]
 Additionally the £16 million[58] 'National Headquarters' located at Southwater in West Sussex houses several general 'Departments', each with a departmental head, consistent with the needs of any major organisation. The current Chief Executive Officer is Chris Sherwood.[59]
 There are five 'Regions' (North, East, Wales & West, South & South West, South East), each headed by a Regional Manager (responsible for all staff and RSPCA HQ facilities) assisted by a Regional Superintendent who has responsibility for the Chief Inspectors, Inspectors, AWOs and ACOs. The Regional Managers are expected to have a broad understanding of operations throughout their regions.
 RSPCA branches operate locally across England and Wales. Branches are separately registered charities operating at a local level and are run by volunteers. Some RSPCA branches are self-funding and raise money locally to support the animal welfare work they do. They find homes for about three-quarters of all animals taken in by the RSPCA. RSPCA branches also offer advice, microchipping, neutering and subsidised animal treatments. In 2013 there were also about 1000 RSPCA shops.
 Each Region of the RSPCA contains 'Groups' of Inspectorate staff. A Group is headed by a Chief Inspector. Each Chief Inspector might typically be responsible for around 8 or more Inspectors, 3 Animals Welfare Officers (AWOs) and 2 Animal Collection Officers (ACOs), working with several local Branches. There are also a small number of Market Inspectors across the country.[60]
 The RSPCA is a registered charity (no. 219099) that relies on donations from the public. The RSPCA states that its mission as a charity is, by all lawful means, to prevent cruelty, promote kindness and to alleviate the suffering of animals.
 RSPCA inspectors respond to calls from the public to investigate alleged mistreatment of animals. They offer advice and assistance to improve animal welfare, and in some cases prosecute under laws such as the Animal Welfare Act 2006.
 Animals rescued by the RSPCA are treated, rehabilitated and rehomed or released wherever possible.[61]
 The RSPCA brings private prosecution (a right available to any civilian) against those it believes, based on independent veterinary opinion, have caused neglect to an animal under laws such as the Animal Welfare Act 2006. The society has its own legal department and veterinary surgeons amongst the resources which facilitate such private prosecutions. All prosecutions are brought via independent solicitors acting for the RSPCA, as the association has no legal enforcement powers or authority in its own right.
 In May 2012 the RSPCA launched their own mobile virtual network operator service, RSPCA Mobile in partnership with MVNO whitelabel service Shebang. RSPCA Mobile claimed to be the first charity mobile phone network in the UK.[62] The agreement included provisions such that the RSPCA would receive up to 15% of top-ups made on the network and it was expected the network would raise £50,000 in the first year of operations.[63] RSPCA Mobile ceased service in October 2014.
 In 1829 when the first recognisable police force was established in England,[64][65] they adopted a similar uniform to that of RSPCA inspectors who had been wearing uniforms since the charity's beginning in 1824. This adoption has led to similarities in the RSPCA rank names and rank insignia with British police ranks, which has led some critics (such as Chris Newman, chairman of the Federation of Companion Animal Societies)[66] to suggest an attempt to ""adopt"" police powers in the public imagination.
 An RSPCA inspector may also verbally caution a member of the public, similar to that used by the police, i.e. ""You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence""; this may strengthen the perception that the RSPCA has statutory powers. 
When Richard Girling of The Times asked about their lack of powers, a spokesman for the RSPCA said ""We would prefer you didn’t publish that, but of course it's up to you"".[66] Chris Newman claimed that the RSPCA ""impersonate police officers and commit trespass. People do believe they have powers of entry"";[66] however, he did not produce any evidence of such impersonation of police officers, and the society strongly deny the charge of impersonation.
 Sally Case, former head of prosecutions, insisted that RSPCA inspectors are trained specifically to make clear to pet-owners that they have no such right. They act without an owner’s permission, she says, ""only if an animal is suffering in a dire emergency. If the court feels evidence has been wrongly obtained, it can refuse to admit it"".[66]
 One recent trial was halted and charges relating to nine dogs were thrown out of court after District Judge Elsey ruled that they had been wrongly seized and that the police and RSPCA acted unlawfully when they entered private property and seized the animals.[67]
 While the Protection of Animals Act 1911 provided a power of arrest for police, the British courts determined that Parliament did not intend any other organisation, such as the RSPCA, to be empowered under the Act and that the RSPCA therefore does not possess police-like powers of arrest, of entry or of search (Line v RSPCA, 1902). Like any other person or organisation that the law deems to have a duty to investigate — such as HM Revenue and Customs and Local Authority Trading Standards — the RSPCA is expected to conform to the rules in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 so far as they relate to matters of investigation. RSPCA officers are trained to state, following giving the caution, that the person is ""not under arrest and can leave at any time"".
 The Animal Welfare Act 2006[68] has now replaced the Protection of Animals Act 1911, and it empowers the police and an inspector appointed by a local authority. Such inspectors are not to be confused with RSPCA Inspectors who are not appointed by local authorities. In cases where, for example, access to premises without the owner’s consent is sought, a local authority or Animal Health inspector or police officer may be accompanied by an RSPCA inspector if he or she is invited to do so, as was the case in previous law.[69]
 Following a series of Freedom of Information requests in 2011, to police constabularies throughout England and Wales[70] it was revealed that the RSPCA has developed local information sharing protocols with a number of constabularies, allowing designated RSPCA workers access to confidential information held on the Police National Computer (PNC). Although RSPCA workers do not have direct access to the PNC, information is shared with them by the various police constabularies which would reveal any convictions, cautions, warnings, reprimands and impending prosecutions. Information regarding motor vehicles can also be accessed. The Association of Chief Police Officers released a statement clarifying that the RSPCA had no direct access to the PNC, and that in common with other prosecuting bodies, it may make a request for disclosure of records. This indirect access does not include any information that the RSPCA does not need in order to prosecute a case at court.[71]
 The RSPCA is an opponent of badger culling; in 2006 there was controversy about a ""political"" campaign against culling, with the Charity Commission being asked to consider claims that the charity had breached guidelines by being too overtly 'political'. The charity responded saying that it took ""careful account of charity law and the guidance issued by the Charity Commission"".[72] Years later, an advertisement published by the RSPCA in the Metro newspaper said: ""The UK Government wants to shoot England's badgers. We want to vaccinate them — and save their lives.""
But more than 100 people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), saying the use of the term ""exterminate"" was misleading. The advertising standards watchdog judged that the advert was likely to mislead the general public who had not taken an active interest in the badger cull saying, ""The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told the RSPCA not to use language that implied the whole badger population in the cull areas would be culled in future advertising.""[73] An RSPCA spokesman said it ""welcomed"" the judgement of the ASA to dismiss three of the areas of complaint about their advert but ""respectfully disagreed"" with the complaint which had been upheld.[74]
 In September 2013 the RSPCA deputy chairman Paul Draycott said that 'too political' campaigns threatened the charity's future and could deter donors.[75] Draycott said that the RSPCA could go insolvent ""We have spent months discussing where we want to be in 10 years time, but unless we develop a strategy for now we won't be here then"". In response the chairman Mike Tomlinson said ""The trustee body continues to place its full support behind the RSPCA's chief executive, management and all our people who do such outstanding work"". The accusations of politicization remain unsubstantiated.
 Paul Draycott also warned that the RSPCA fears an exodus of ""disillusioned staff"" with ""poor or even non-existent management training and career paths"" for employees. In response the RSPCA’s chief executive, Gavin Grant denied suggestions in the memo that there was ""no strategy"" in some areas, stating that there was no difficulty in attracting trustees or serious internal concerns about management.[76]
 In June 2014 RSPCA campaigner Peta Watson-Smith compared the conditions livestock are brought up in across the country to that of the Jews during the Holocaust. The comments were condemned by countryside campaigners and Jewish groups.[77] In 2015 Peta Watson-Smith was elected to the RSPCA ruling council saying more money should be spent prosecuting farmers. At the same election the RSPCA members also voted to give a seat on the ruling council to Dan Lyons, who has previously called for pet owners to sit an exam.[78]
 In 2016 the new head of the RSPCA, Jeremy Cooper, made a dramatic, public apology for the charity’s past mistakes and vowed to be less political and bring fewer prosecutions in the future.[79] The new Chief Executive admitted that RSPCA had become ""too adversarial"" and will now be ""a lot less political"".[80] Mr Cooper said that the charity had alienated farmers in its aggressive campaign against the Government’s badger cull and disclosed that it would be “very unlikely” to ever bring another prosecution against a hunt. CEO Jeremy Cooper later resigned after just on year in charge.[81]
 In April 2019 the RSPCA has faced a new fraud investigation held at south-east London branch over the alleged mishandling of funds by two men,who were arrested on suspicion of fraud. The suspected fraud was exposed during a financial  audit of the south-east London branch.[82]
 The RSPCA also state that whilst a few of their own branches operate ""no kill"" policies themselves,[83] its policy on euthanasia is:
 The RSPCA is working for a world in which no rehomable animal is put to sleep. Currently the RSPCA accepts, with great reluctance that in certain circumstances euthanasia may be necessary, when the animal is not rehomable, because it is sick or injured, for behavioural reasons or occasionally because there are no appropriate homes available and the animal would therefore endure long-term suffering through deprivation of basic needs.[84]
 There have been incidents where the RSPCA has apologised for decisions to euthanise animals.[85] In 2008, the RSPCA was sued by Hindu monks over the killing of a sacred cow at the Bhaktivedanta Manor Hindu temple and 200 people protested at the RSPCA headquarters. On 13 December 2008, the RSPCA admitted culpability, apologised for the euthanising of the cow, and donated a pregnant cow to the temple as a symbol of reconciliation.[86][87][88][89]
 The RSPCA admitted that in 2014 it had euthanised 205 healthy horses. In one particular case 12 horses from a Lancashire farm that had been assessed by vets as being ""bright, alert and responsive"" and suffering no life-threatening issues were killed by the RSPCA.[90] In a 2016 court case the RSPCA admitted that in 2015 it had illegally euthanised 11 healthy horses and attempted to charge the owner for 100 days of stabling fees for the period after the horses were already dead. The charge was overturned in a court decision.[89]
 In May 2013 former RSPCA employee Dawn Aubrey-Ward was found hanged at her home when suffering from depression after leaving the animal charity.[91] Aubrey-Ward was described by The Daily Telegraph as a whistleblower for the RSPCA's prosecution practices. The RSPCA subsequently had a meeting with the Charity Commission over its approach to prosecutions.[92]
 On 7 August 2013 the BBC Radio 4 Face the Facts radio programme broadcast an episode called ""The RSPCA – A law unto itself?""[93]
The programme presented a number of cases of where the RSPCA has sought to hound vets and expert witnesses who had appeared in court for the defence in RSPCA prosecutions. In one case it sought to discredit the author of the RSPCA Complete Horse Care Manual (Vogel) after he appeared as an expert witness for the defence team in an RSPCA prosecution.[94] The RSPCA later released a statement saying that this is untrue and that they do not persecute vets and lawyers who appear for the defence and as defence experts. There have been thousands of lawyers taking defence cases against the RSPCA and they have only ever made a complaint about one.[95]
 In November 2013 the RSPCA was accused of instigating police raids on small animal shelters with insufficient evidence that animals were being mistreated. The owners claimed that they were being persecuted because of their ""no kill"" policy of only putting animals down if they cannot be effectively treated.[83] The RSPCA stated that their inspectors will offer advice and guidance to help people improve conditions for their animals, and it only seeks the help of the police where it considers there is no reasonable alternative to safeguard animal welfare.[96]
 The RSPCA has been criticised by the Scottish SPCA for fund-raising in Scotland and thereby ""stealing food from the mouths of animals north of the border by taking donations intended for Scotland.""[97] The RSPCA insists that it does not deliberately advertise in Scotland but that many satellite channels only enabled the organisation to purchase UK-wide advertising. In a statement, the RSPCA said it went ""to great lengths"" to ensure wherever possible that adverts were not distributed outside England and Wales, and ""Every piece of printed literature, television advertising and internet banner advertising always features the wording 'The RSPCA is a charity registered in England and Wales'"". ""All Scottish donors, who contact us via RSPCA fundraising campaigns, are directed to the Scottish SPCA so that they can donate to them if they so wish.""[97] The Scottish SPCA changed its logo in 2005 to make a clearer distinction between itself and the RSPCA in an attempt to prevent legacies being left to its English equivalent by mistake when the Scottish charity was intended.[98]
 One PIF by the RSPCA gained controversy when it was aired in cinemas. In it, a dog is shown while a somber instrumental rendition of ""How Much Is That Doggie In The Window?"" is played before a revolver is pointed at the dog's head. A voiceover then intones, ""Please give us a pound - or we'll have to pull the trigger."" The PIF reportedly horrified so many viewers that the RSPCA was forced to pull it off the air and replace with a tamer version warning about the cost of giving a pet for Christmas, with a new rendition of ""How Much Is That Doggie In The Window?"" being sung by a young child and the shots of the revolver removed.
 Another PIF by the RSPCA called ""My Little Puppy"" was made in 2001. The PIF shows why getting a dog is fun and exciting, then large words shows up saying ""My Little Puppy"". The voiceover then talks about the disadvantages of the dog, and shows it abandoned in a very unsanitary closet. Lastly, it shows the dog being put in a gym bag by its owner, who then proceeds to throw the bag in a river, with the words ""Pets aren't toys."" onscreen.[citation needed]"
Royal Society for the Protection of Birds	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_for_the_Protection_of_Birds	"The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) is a charitable organisation registered in England and Wales[2] and in Scotland.[3] It was founded in 1889. It works to promote conservation and protection of birds and the wider environment through public awareness campaigns, petitions and through the operation of nature reserves throughout the United Kingdom.[4]
 The RSPB has over 1,300 employees, 18,000 volunteers and more than a million members (including 195,000 youth members), making it the largest wildlife conservation charity in Europe.[5] The RSPB has many local groups and maintains 200 nature reserves.[6]
 The origins of the RSPB lie with two groups of women, both formed in 1889. The Plumage League[7] was founded by Emily Williamson at her house in Didsbury, Manchester, (now in Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden),[8] as a protest group campaigning against the use of great crested grebe and kittiwake skins and feathers in fur clothing. The Fur, Fin and Feather Folk was founded in Croydon by Eliza Phillips, Etta Lemon, Catherine Hall and others. The groups gained in popularity and amalgamated in 1891 to form the Society for the Protection of Birds in London.[9] The Society gained its Royal Charter in 1904.[10]
 The original members of the RSPB were all women[11] who campaigned against the fashion of the time for women to wear exotic feathers in hats, and the consequent encouragement of ""plume hunting"". To this end the Society had two simple rules:[9]
 At the time of founding, the trade in plumage for use in hats was very large: in the first quarter of 1884, almost 7,000 bird-of-paradise skins were being imported to Britain, along with 400,000 birds from West India and Brazil, and 360,000 birds from East India.[12]
 In 1890, the society published its first leaflet, entitled Destruction of Ornamental-Plumaged Birds,[13] aimed at saving the egret population by informing wealthy women of the environmental damage wrought by the use of feathers in fashion. A later 1897 publication, Bird Food in Winter,[14] aimed to address the use of berries as winter decoration and encouraged the use of synthetic berries to preserve the birds food source. By 1898 the RSPB had 20,000 members and in 1897 alone had distributed over 16,000 letters and 50,000 leaflets.[15]
 The Society attracted support from some women of high social standing who belonged to the social classes that popularised the wearing of feathered hats, including the Duchess of Portland (who became the Society's first President) and the Ranee of Sarawak. As the organisation began to attract the support of many other influential figures, both male and female, such as the ornithologist Professor Alfred Newton, it gained in popularity and attracted many new members. The society received a Royal Charter in 1904[9] from Edward VII, just 15 years after its founding, and was instrumental in petitioning the Parliament of the United Kingdom to introduce laws banning the use of plumage in clothing.[8]
 At the time that the Society was founded in Britain, similar societies were also founded in other European countries.[16][which?] In 1961, the society acquired The Lodge in Sandy, Bedfordshire as its new headquarters.[8] The RSPB's logo depicts an Avocet. The first version was designed by Robert Gillmor.[17]
 Today, the RSPB works with both the civil service and the Government to advise Government policies on conservation and environmentalism.[18] It is one of several organisations that determine the official conservation status list for all birds found in the UK.
 The RSPB does not run bird hospitals nor offer animal rescue services.[19]
 The RSPB maintains over 200 reserves throughout the United Kingdom,[6] covering a wide range of habitats, from estuaries and mudflats to forests and urban habitats.[20] The reserves often have bird hides provided for birdwatchers and many provide visitor centres, which include information about the wildlife that can be seen there.[21]
 The RSPB confers awards, including the President's Award, for volunteers who make a notable contribution to the work of the society.
 According to the RSPB:
 The RSPB Medal is the Society's most prestigious award. It is presented to an individual in recognition of wild bird protection and countryside conservation. It is usually awarded annually to one or occasionally two people.[22] The RSPB has published a members-only magazine for over a century.

 The title changed to Bird Notes in 1947. In the 1950s, there were four copies per year (one for each season, published on the 1st of each third month, March, June, September and December). Each volume covered two years, spread over three calendar years. For example, volume XXV (25), number one was dated Winter 1951, and number eight in the same volume was dated Autumn 1953.
 From the mid-1950s, many of the covers were by Charles Tunnicliffe. Two of the originals are on long-term loan to the Tunnicliffe gallery at Oriel Ynys Môn, but in 1995 the RSPB sold 114 at a Sotheby's auction, raising £210,000, the most expensive being a picture of a partridge which sold for £6,440.[23]
 From January 1964 (vol. 31, no. 1), publication increased to six per year, (issued in the odd-numbered months, January, March and so on, but dated ""January–February"", ""March–April"", etc.). Volumes again covered two years, so vol. 30, covering 1962–63, therefore included nine issues, ending with the ""Winter 1963–64"" edition instead of eight. The final edition, vol. 31 no. 12, was published in late 1965.
 Bird Notes' successor Birds (ISSN 1367-983X) replaced it immediately, with volume 1, number 1 being the January–February 1966 edition. Issues were published quarterly, numbered so that a new volume started every other year.
 The Autumn 2013 edition, dated August–October 2013, being vol. 25 no. 7, was the last.[24]
 In Winter 2013 Birds was replaced by a new magazine, Nature's Home. The editor was Mark Ward. The magazine had an ABC-certified circulation of 600,885.[25]
 The RSPB has two separate groups for children and teenagers: Wildlife Explorers (founded in 1943 as the Junior Bird Recorders' Club; from 1965–2000 the Young Ornithologist's Club or YOC[8]) and RSPB Phoenix. Wildlife Explorers is targeted at children aged between 8 and 12, although it also has some younger members,[26] and has two different magazines: Wild Times for the under 8s and Bird Life for those over 8. RSPB Phoenix is aimed at teenagers, and produces Wingbeat magazine, although members also receive Bird Life magazine.[27] The RSPB is a member of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services.[28]
 RSPB organises bird record data collection in annual collective birdwatching days in Britain. RSPB claims this is the ""world's biggest wildlife survey"" and helps that society to get a better knowledge on bird population trends in Britain.[29] That activity was launched in 1979 as an activity for kids, although from 2001 is a survey open to adults too. In 2011 over 600,000 people took part, being only 37% RSPB's members. The usual date for this birdwatching collective activity is the January's last weekend. From the start of this annual survey records for sparrows show a decline of 60%, while starling population's decline is about 80% from 1979 to 2012.[29]
 BirdTrack is an online citizen science website, operated by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) on behalf of a partnership of the BTO, the RSPB, BirdWatch Ireland, the Scottish Ornithologists' Club and the Welsh Ornithological Society (Welsh: Cymdeithas Adaryddol Cymru).[30][31]
 The RSPB is funded primarily by its members; in 2006, over 50% of the society's £88 million income came from subscriptions, donations and legacies, worth a total of £53.669 million.[1] As a registered charity, the organisation is entitled to gift aid worth an extra £0.28 on every £1.00 donated by income tax payers.[32] It also receives contractual payments from clean energy utilities and financiers of renewable energy solutions, when its members sign up as clients.[33] The bulk of the income (£63.757 million in 2006) is spent on conservation projects, maintenance of the reserves and on education projects, with the rest going on fundraising efforts and reducing the pension deficit, worth £19.8 million in 2006.
 It was reported in an article in The Daily Mail on 2 November 2014 that claims that the charity ""was spending 90 per cent of its income on conservation"" by the UK Advertising Standards Authority were incorrect. The article claimed that the true figure was closer to 26%. The Charity Commission investigated the claims, and contacted the RSPB to get it to clarify its web statement. The RSPB complied, with the clarification that 90% of its net income (after expenses, not gross income as received) was spent on conservation, and that conservation activities were diverse, not limited to spending on its own nature reserves. This was accepted by the Charity Commission.[34]
 Over time, the organisation's chief officers have been given different titles.[8][35]
 The RSPB is a member of Wildlife and Countryside Link.[38] The RSPB is the UK Partner of BirdLife International[39] and manages the South Atlantic Invasive Species Project on behalf of the partner governments.

Saint Camillus Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Camillus_Foundation	"The Saint Camillus Foundation of Thailand is a charitable organization in Thailand, set up and run by the Camillian monastic order.[1]
 In 1995, the foundation, with the participation of an Italian priest Father Giovanni Contarin, established a Camillian Social Centre in the Rayong Province. The center was built to provide shelter and care to homeless, indigent, and rejected people living with HIV/AIDS.[2][3] Special emphasis was placed on women and children, as they were most vulnerable.[4]
 Saint Camillus Foundation also operates Camillian Social Center Sampran, caring for elders; Camillian Social Center Prachinburi, caring for lepers; Camillian Social Center Chantaburi, caring for elders; Camillian Social Center Chiangrai, caring for tribal children; and two hospitals, including Camillian Hospital in Bangkok and San Camillo Hospital in Ban Pong, Ratchaburi Province.[5]"
The Salvation Army	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army	"The Salvation Army (TSA) is a Protestant Christian church and an international charitable organisation. The organisation reports a worldwide membership of over 1.7 million,[3] consisting of soldiers, officers and adherents collectively known as Salvationists. Its founders sought to bring salvation to the poor, destitute, and hungry by meeting both their ""physical and spiritual needs"". It is present in 131 countries,[4] running charity shops, operating shelters for the homeless and disaster relief and humanitarian aid to developing countries.
 The theology of the Salvation Army is derived from that of Methodism, although it is distinctive in institution and practice. A peculiarity of the Army is that it gives its clergy titles of military ranks, such as ""lieutenant"" or ""major"". It does not celebrate the rite of Baptism and Holy Communion. However, the Army's doctrine is otherwise typical of holiness churches in the Wesleyan-Arminian tradition. The Army's purposes are ""the advancement of the Christian religion ... of education, the relief of poverty, and other charitable objects beneficial to society or the community of mankind as a whole"".[5]
 The Army was founded in 1865 in London by one-time Methodist circuit-preacher William Booth and his wife Catherine as the East London Christian Mission, and can trace its origins to the Blind Beggar tavern. In 1878 Booth reorganised the mission, becoming its first General and introducing the military structure which has been retained as a matter of tradition.[6] Its highest priority is its Christian principles. The current international leader of The Salvation Army and chief executive officer (CEO) is General Brian Peddle, who was elected by the High Council of The Salvation Army on 3 August 2018.[7]
 The Salvation Army refers to its ministers as ""officers"". When acting in their official duties, they can often be recognized by the colour-coded epaulettes on their white uniform dress shirts. The epaulettes have the letters SA embroidered on them in white.  Officers ranks include lieutenant, captain, major, colonel and the general. Promotion in rank up to the rank from lieutenant to major depends primarily on years of service.
 The ordination of women is permitted in the Salvation Army. Salvation Army officers were previously allowed to marry only other officers (this rule varies in different countries); but this rule has been relaxed in recent years. Husbands and wives usually share the same rank and have the same or similar assignments. Such officer-couples are then assigned together to act as co-pastors and administer corps, Adult Rehabilitation Centers and such.
 As of 2017 the organisation will not appoint homosexual people to posts as ministers, preferring individuals ""whose values are consistent with the church's philosophy"".[8] (See also § Criticism by LGBT activists section.) See also LGBT clergy in Christianity.
 The Army has churches located throughout the world. They are known as Salvation Army corps. They may be implemented as part of a larger community center. Traditionally many corps buildings are alternatively called temples or citadels.
 The Salvation Army is well known for its network of thrift stores or charity shops, colloquially referred to as ""the Sally Ann"" in Canada, ""Salvos Stores"" in Australia, and ""Sally's"" in New Zealand, which raise money for its rehabilitation programs by selling donated used items such as clothing, housewares and toys.  Clothing collected by Salvation Army stores that are not sold on location are often sold wholesale on the global second hand clothing market.
 The Salvation Army's fundraising shops in the United Kingdom participate in the UK government's Work Programme, a workfare programme where benefit claimants must work for no compensation for 20 to 40 hours per week over periods that can be as long as 6 months.[9][10][11][12]
 When items are bought at the Salvation Army thrift stores, part of the proceeds go towards The Salvation Army's emergency reliefs efforts and programs.[13] Items not sold are recycled and turned into other items such as carpets and rugs, instead of being thrown away in landfills.[13] The Salvation Army also helps their employees by hiring ex-felons depending on the circumstances because they believe in giving people second chances. There are many job opportunities available for them nationwide and are able to move their way up to become a manager or even work in one of their corporate offices.[14]
 Some shops are associated with an Adult Rehabilitation Centers (ARC) where men and women make a 6-month rehabilitation commitment to live and work at the ARC residence. They are unpaid, but they are provided with comfortable room and board. Many ARCs are male-only. The program is primarily to combat addiction. They work at the warehouse, store or residence. This is referred to as ""work therapy"". They attend classes, twelve-step programs and chapel services as a part of their rehabilitation. The Army advertises these programs on their collection trucks with the slogan ""Doing the Most Good"".[15] The general design pattern is that an ARC is associated with a main store and warehouse. Donations are consolidated from other stores and donation sites and then sorted and priced and then distributed back out to the branch stores. Low-quality donated items are sold at the warehouse dock in a ""dock sale"".
 Farmland at Hadleigh in Essex was acquired in 1891 to provide training for men referred from Salvation Army shelters. It featured market gardens, orchards and two brickfields. It was mentioned in the Royal Commission report of 1909 appointed to consider Poor Laws. 7,000 trainees had passed through its doors by 1912 with more than 60% subsequently finding employment.[16] It is still operating today and has a Twitter feed @SalArmyHFE[17] and website.
 The Salvation Army operates summer camps for children, Silvercrest Residences, and adult day care centers. It has headquarter offices internationally, nationally and for each territory and division. Some of the other facilities include:[3]
 Their mission statement reads:
 The Salvation Army, an international movement, is an evangelical part of the universal Christian church. Its message is based on the Bible. Its ministry is motivated by the love of God. Its mission is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and to meet human needs in His name without discrimination. Early beliefs of the Salvation Army were influenced by a book Helps to Holiness,[18] which was to influence spiritual life of the Army for a generation.[19] The sacred text of the Salvation Army is the Bible[20] and the beliefs of the Salvation Army rest upon these eleven doctrines:[21]
 The denomination does not celebrate the Christian sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion. The International Spiritual Life Commission opinion on Baptism is that enrolment as a Soldier by accepting the call to discipleship should be followed by a lifetime of continued obedient faith in Christ.[22] The Commissions considered option of Holy Communion is that God's grace is readily accessible in all places and at all times, although Salvationists may participate in Holy Communion if attending a service of worship in another Christian denomination if the host Church allows.[23] Although its officers conduct marriages, it holds a traditional Protestant belief that marriage was not instituted by Christ and therefore is not a sacrament. The mercy seat is a focal point in a Salvation Army Church, symbolising God's call to his people, and a place for commitment and communion, and is available for anyone to kneel at in prayer.[24]
 There is no requirement for anyone attending a service to be a member of the Salvation Army in any capacity (as a Soldier, Adherent or Officer) and services in Salvation Army churches feature a variety of activities:[25]
 Local corps usually sing contemporary worship music songs in Sunday worship services, as well as traditional hymns and music accompanied by the brass band. These are usually from the official Songbook Of The Salvation Army. They sometimes use Christian songs in the popular music genre. The American corps have adopted a mainstream Christian format with video screens showing words to music so that the audience and sing along typical of modern megachurches. Worship services usually no longer have a traditional brass band. This is reflective for many social and cultural reasons.[citation needed] Some Salvation Army corps make use of smaller ensembles of musicians. Often this ensemble consists simply of a guitar, piano or a keyboard, drums and sometimes a bass guitar and other instruments, especially during ""Youth Fellowships"".[citation needed] The music played does tend to also take on a more contemporary style as is reflected in modern music today. The early Salvation Army bands were known for their excitement and public appeal, and the modern ensemble keeps to this ideology. Traditional hymns are still used in worship services and these are blended with other musical pieces from Christian Music Publishers such as Vineyard Music, Hillsong, and Planet Shakers to name but a few.
 The Soldiers Covenant[27] is the creed of the Salvation Army.  All members of the church and congregants are required to subscribe to this creed; every person has to sign the document before they can become enrolled as a Soldier.[28] Members have traditionally been referred to as ""soldiers"" of Christ.[29][30][31] These were formerly known as the Articles of War and include: Having received with all my heart the salvation offered to me by the tender mercy of God, I do here and now acknowledge God the Father to be my King; God the Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, to be my Savior; and God the Holy Spirit to be my Guide, Comforter and Strength, and I will, by His help, love, serve, worship and obey this glorious God through time and in eternity.[32]
 Positional Statements[33] describe Salvation Army policy on various social and moral issues, are carefully considered and subject to review. They are derived from work by the International Moral and Social Issues Council. The Salvation Army opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide. Its official stance on abortion is that ""The Salvation Army believes in the sanctity of all human life and considers each person to be of infinite value and each life a gift from God to be cherished, nurtured and redeemed. Human life is sacred because it is made in the image of God and has an eternal destiny. (Genesis 1:27) Sacredness is not conferred, nor can it be taken away by human agreement."" The Salvation Army official stance admitted in 2010 exceptions in cases such as rape and incest: ""In addition, rape and incest are brutal acts of dominance violating women physically and emotionally. This situation represents a special case for the consideration of termination as the violation may be compounded by the continuation of the pregnancy.""[34] It is also against the death penalty: ""The Salvation Army recognises that the opinions of Salvationists are divided on the moral acceptability of capital punishment and its effectiveness as a deterrent. However, to advocate in any way the continuance or restoration of capital punishment in any part of the world would be inconsistent with the Army's purposes and contrary to the Army's belief that all human life is sacred and that each human being, however wretched, can become a new person in Christ.""
 In 2012, the Salvation Army published a ""Positional Statement on Homosexuality"" after receiving adverse publicity about their position on homosexuality.[35]
 The Bible teaches that God's intention for humankind is that society should be ordered on the basis of lifelong, legally sanctioned heterosexual unions. ... A disposition towards homosexuality is not in itself blameworthy nor is the disposition seen as rectifiable at will. ... Homosexual practice however, is, in the light of Scripture, clearly unacceptable. Such activity is chosen behaviour and is thus a matter of the will. It is therefore able to be directed or restrained in the same way heterosexual urges are controlled. Homosexual practice would render any person ineligible for full membership (soldiership) in the Army.[36]
 In the United States, the Salvation Army's first major forays into disaster relief resulted from the tragedies of the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The Salvationists' nationwide appeals for financial and material donations yielded tremendous support, enabling the Army to provide assistance to thousands. General Evangeline Booth, when she offered the services of Salvationists to President Woodrow Wilson during the First World War, thrust Salvation Army social and relief work to newer heights. Today the Salvation Army is best known for its charitable efforts.
 The Salvation Army is a non-governmental relief agency and is usually among the first to arrive with help after natural or man-made disasters. They have worked to alleviate suffering and help people rebuild their lives. After the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, they arrived immediately at some of the worst disaster sites to help retrieve and bury the dead. Since then they have helped rebuild homes and construct new boats for people to recover their livelihood. Members were prominent among relief organisations after Hurricane Hugo and Hurricane Andrew and other such natural disasters in the United States. In August 2005, they supplied drinking water to poor people affected by the heat wave in the United States. Later in 2005 they responded to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. They have helped the victims of an earthquake in Indonesia in May 2006.
 Since Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, the Salvation Army has allocated donations of more than $365 million to serve more than 1.7 million people in nearly every state. The Army's immediate response to Hurricane Katrina included the mobilisation of more than 178 canteen feeding units and 11 field kitchens which together have served more than 5.7 million hot meals, 8.3 million sandwiches, snacks and drinks. Its SATERN (Salvation Army Team Emergency Radio Network)[37] network of amateur ham-radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25,000 survivors. Salvation Army pastoral care counsellors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277,000 individuals. As part of the overall effort, Salvation Army officers, employees and volunteers have contributed more than 900,000 hours of service.
 The Salvation Army was one of the first relief agencies on the scene of the September 11 attacks in New York City in 2001. They also provided prayer support for families of missing people.
 The Salvation Army, along with the American National Red Cross, Southern Baptist Convention, and other disaster relief organisations, are national members of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD).[38]
 Also among the disaster relief capabilities is the Red Shield Defence Services, often called the SallyMan for short. The effort that they put in is similar to that of a chaplain, and reaches many more, offering cold drinks, hot drinks, and some biscuits for the soldiers of the military to have, though, if a SallyMan is on deployment, the locals are offered a share in the produce.
 Around the world the Salvation Army have Emergency Services Support Units throughout the country. These are mobile canteen vehicles[39] providing food and other welfare to members of the Emergency Services such as bushfires, floods, land search, and other both large- and small-scale emergency operations undertaken by Police, Fire, Ambulance and State Emergency Service members, and the general public affected by these events. Volunteers and officers run the canteen service and the response policy is to respond when emergency services have been on the scene for more than four hours or where four or more Fire vehicles are responding.
 The Family Tracing Service (sometimes known as the Missing Persons Service) was established in 1885, and the service is now available in most of the countries where The Salvation Army operates. The Tracing Service's objective is to restore (or to sustain) family relationships where contact has been lost, whether recently or in the distant past. Thousands of people are traced every year on behalf of their relatives.
 The Salvation Army includes many youth groups, which primarily consist of its Sunday schools and the Scout and Guide packs that are sometimes set up. The Scout and Guide packs are affiliated and sponsored by the Salvation Army but are open units allowing anyone to join, these units/pack observe Christian standards and encourage the young people to investigate and develop in their Christian faith. Some territories have Salvation Army Guards and Legions Association (SAGALA). In the United States these internal youth groups that are specifically for females are known as Girl Guards (older females) and Sunbeams (younger females). Adventure Corps serves boys who are enrolled in school for first through eighth grade, and is sometimes separated into Rangers (6th-8th Grade) and Explorers (5th Grade and younger).
 In the 21st century, the Salvation Army in the United Kingdom created a branch for the youth, called Alove,[40] the Salvation Army for a new generation. Its purpose is to free the youth of the church and their communities to express themselves and their faith in their own ways. Its mission statement is ""Calling a generation to dynamic faith, radical lifestyle, adventurous mission and a fight for justice"", and it emphasises worship, discipleship, missions, and social action. Alove is a member of the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS).[41]
 The Salvation Army was founded in London's East End in 1865 by one-time Methodist Reform Church minister William Booth and his wife Catherine as the East London Christian Mission,[1] and this name was used until 1878.[42] The name ""The Salvation Army"" developed from an incident on 19 and 20 May. William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary George Scott Railton and said, ""We are a volunteer army."" Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, ""Volunteer! I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!"" Railton was instructed to cross out the word ""volunteer"" and substitute the word ""salvation"".[43] The Salvation Army was modelled after the military, with its own flag (or colours) and its own hymns, often with words set to popular and folkloric tunes sung in the pubs. Booth and the other soldiers in ""God's Army"" would wear the Army's own uniform, for meetings and ministry work. He became the ""General"" and his other ministers were given appropriate ranks as ""officers"". Other members became ""soldiers"".[44]
 When William Booth became known as the General, Catherine is known as the ""Mother of The Salvation Army"".  William Booth's early motivation for The Salvation Army was to convert poor Londoners such as prostitutes, gamblers and alcoholics to Christianity,[45] while Catherine spoke to the wealthier people, gaining financial support for their work. She also acted as a religious minister, which was unusual at the time; the Foundation Deed of the Christian Mission states that women had the same rights to preach as men. William Booth described the organisation's approach: ""The three 'S's' best expressed the way in which the Army administered to the 'down and outs': first, soup; second, soap; and finally, salvation.""[46]
 In 1880, the Salvation Army started its work in three others countries: Australia, Ireland, and the United States. Salvationists set out for the United States in 1880, and when George Scott Railton and his team arrived they started work in Harry Hill's Variety Theatre on 14 March 1880. The first notable convert was Ashbarrel Jimmie who had so many convictions for drunkenness that the judge sentenced him to attend the Salvation Army.[47] The corps in New York were founded as a result of Jimmys' rehabilitation. It was not always an Officer of The Salvation Army who started the Salvation Army in a new country; sometimes Salvationists emigrated to countries and started operating as ""the Salvation Army"" on their own authority. When the first official officers arrived in Australia and the United States, they found groups of Salvationists already waiting for them and started working with each other. Australia was the place where the Army's organised social work began on 8 December 1883 with the establishment of a home for ex-convicts.[48] In 1891 Booth established a farm colony in Hadleigh, Essex.
 The Salvation Army's main converts were at first alcoholics, morphine addicts, prostitutes and other ""undesirables"" unwelcome in polite Christian society, which helped prompt the Booths to start their own church.[49]  The Booths did not include the use of sacraments (mainly baptism and Holy Communion) in the Army's form of worship, believing that many Christians had come to rely on the outward signs of spiritual grace rather than on grace itself.[50] Other beliefs are that its members should completely refrain from drinking alcohol (Holy Communion is not practiced), smoking, taking illegal drugs and gambling.[51] Its soldiers wear a uniform tailored to the country in which they work; the uniform can be white, grey, navy, fawn and are even styled like a sari in some areas. Any member of the public is welcome to attend their meetings.
As the Salvation Army grew rapidly in the late 19th century, it generated opposition in England. Opponents, grouped under the name of the Skeleton Army, disrupted Salvation Army meetings and gatherings, with tactics such as throwing rocks, bones, rats, and tar as well as physical assaults on members of the Salvation Army. Much of this was led by pub owners who were losing business because of the Army's opposition to alcohol and targeting of the frequenters of saloons and public houses.[52]
 The Salvation Army's reputation in the United States improved as a result of its disaster relief efforts following the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The familiar use of bell ringers to solicit donations from passers-by ""helps complete the American portrait of Christmas.""[according to whom?] In the U.S. alone, over 25,000 volunteers with red kettles are stationed near retail stores during the weeks preceding Christmas for fundraising.[49] The church remains a highly visible and sometimes controversial presence in many parts of the world.
 In 1994, the Chronicle of Philanthropy, an industry publication, released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organisation popularity and credibility. The study showed that The Salvation Army was ranked as the 4th ""most popular charity/non-profit in America"" of over 100 charities researched, with 47% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing 'Love' and 'Like A Lot' for The Salvation Army.[53]
 Charity Watch rates the Salvation Army an ""A-"" to an ""A"",[54] indicating a high level of financial efficiency and organisational transparency.
 In 1917, over two hundred-fifty Salvation Army volunteers went overseas to France to provide supplies and baked goods, including donuts, to American soldiers. The women who served donuts to the troops fried them in soldiers' helmets. They were known as ""Donut Lassies"" and are credited with popularising donuts in the United States.[55] National Doughnut Day is now celebrated on the first Friday of June every year, starting in Chicago of 1938, to honour those who served doughnuts to soldiers during World War l.[56]
 As of 23 October 2016 the Salvation Army operates in 128 countries[4] and provides services in 175 different languages. For administrative purposes, the Salvation Army divides itself geographically into 5 zones[57] and the zonal departments at International Headquarters[58] in London, United Kingdom are the main administrative link with territories and commands[59]
 These are further divided into territories, which are then sub-divided into divisions. Some territories cover several countries (like Italy and Greece)[60] while some countries may have several territories (Australia Eastern and Australia Southern)[61] In larger areas, regional and area commands are also introduced as subdivisions of divisions. Each territory has an administrative hub known as territorial headquarters (THQ). Likewise, each division has a divisional headquarters (DHQ). Each of these territories is led by a territorial commander who receives orders from the Salvation Army's international headquarters in London. A territory is normally led by an officer holding the rank of colonel (for small territories) or commissioner for larger territories. In some countries, the work of The Salvation Army may be called a command, led by a command commander. A larger command is typically led by an officer holding the rank of colonel. There is a Women's Ministries[62] division devoted to supporting women in ministry which has 766,369 members,[63] founded as the Home League[64] in 1907. Red Shield Defence Services[65] work with the Armed Services in order to provide assistance such as refreshments, soap, chewing gum, toothpaste and sewing kits. ""Waves Of Transformation""[66] is a water resources project assisting deprived communities. The International Spiritual Life Commission, is convened by the General to examine and identify aspects essential to the spiritual growth of both the Church and individual Salvationists.[67] Reliance Bank is the financial services arm of the Salvation Army, offering bank accounts, loans and mortgages. It is registered with the UK banking regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority,[68] registration number 204537. SAGIC Insurance[69] is the insurance services arm of the Army, offering various types of policy, a nationwide removals service[70] and a conveyancing service for buying and selling houses.
 Heritage Centres are museums run by the Salvation Army which have exhibits and historical documents related to the history and work of the organisation. Heritage Centres collect, preserve, catalog, research and share material about the life and work of The Salvation Army. The International Heritage Centre in London can provide details of premises in any specific territory.[71] Much of what happens at the High Council is governed by British Law, as set out in the Salvation Army Acts (1931 to 1968). The 2013 High Council consists of 118 members (62 women and 56 men) made up of the Chief of Staff, all the active commissioners and territorial leaders (some territories are led by colonels), each of whom was summoned by the Chief of the Staff for the sole purpose of electing a new General.[72] The International Heritage Centre in London, England is located at the William Booth Memorial Training College and can provide details of premises in any specific territory[73] and runs the @SalvArmyArchive Twitter feed. Another training college for officers is the Catherine Booth Bible College based at Winnipeg, Canada[74] which was authorised in August 1983 by the Manitoba Legislature to grant academic degrees. International Development Services team[75] work with some of the pooest communities around the world and run the official @TSA_Projects Twitter feed.
 National Salvation Army week was created by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on November 24, 1954, telling people to honor the Salvation Army during that week for its work in the United States in the past seventy-five years.[76] The Salvation Army was one of the original six organizations that made up the USO along with YMCA, YWCA, National Catholic Community Services, National Jewish Welfare Board, and National Travelers Aid Association.[77]
 An early precursor to the Salvation Army becoming involved in safeguarding work was Catherine Booth writing to Queen Victoria regarding a Parliamentary bill for the protection of girls.[78] Safeguarding legislation was strengthened by a new Act of Parliament, the ""Public General Act, An Act to make further provision for the Protection of Women and Girls, the suppression of brothels, and other purposes, (otherwise known as the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885)"", which received Royal Assent on 14 August 1885[79]
The Salvation Army was involved in getting this Act passed.[80] Work included a petition (numbering 340,000 signatures deposited on the floor of the House of Commons by 8 uniformed Salvationists),[81] mass meetings and an investigation into child prostitution. W. T. Stead of the Pall Mall Gazette launched a campaign in 1885 by writing articles on The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon to expose the extent of child prostitution[82] which involved procuring a girl, Eliza for £5. She was cared for by the Army, taken to France and subsequently testified as a key witness at the trial of Stead and Rebecca Jarrett (the prostitute who had arranged the ""sale"" of Eliza) at Bow Street. Both were sentenced to 6 months in prison. The newly founded Salvation Army in Japan also encountered child prostitution, derived from a system of Debt Bondage. While an imperial ordinance (written in classical Japanese which few could understand) declared the girls right to freedom, the pioneer Salvationist Gunpei Yamamuro rewrote it in colloquial speech.[83] His wife Kiye took charge of a girls home to provide secure accommodation for any girl wishing to give up prostitution. An imperial ordinance passed on 2 October 1900 stated that any woman who wished to give up prostitution only had to go to the nearest Police station and ask.
 The involvement of the Salvation Army in work to combat slavery and people trafficking can be traced back to William Booth publishing a letter in The War Cry in 1885.[84] The same year an escapee from a prostitution house turned up on the door of the Salvation Army headquarters and sought help from Bramwell Booth.[85] Work with people at risk of exploitation continues today, with a specialist team, and working in partnership with the UK service Modern Slavery Helpline (telephone 0800 0121 700). Work is also done assisting homeless people by running 461 hostels[86] and 20 Refugee programmes.
 Various Constituting Instruments apply to different aspects of the work of the Salvation Army. Legislation passed in the United Kingdom Parliament covered the following:
 The most recent statistics for membership[93] from the 2018 Year Book[94] are 111,859 employees, 17,168 Active Officers, 9,775 Retired Officers, 1,050 Cadets, 175,811 Adherents, 411,327 Junior Soldiers and 1,182,100 Senior Soldiers. Previous membership statistics (as quoted from 2010 year book) includes 16,938 active and 9,190 retired officers, 39,071 Corps Cadets and more than 4.5 million volunteers. Members of the Salvation Army also include ""adherents""; these are people who do not make the commitment to be a soldier but who recognise the Salvation Army as their church. (According to the 2006 Salvation Army year book, in the United States there are 85,148 senior soldiers and 28,377 junior soldiers, 17,396 adherents and around 60,000 employees.) Further information is available from the Salvation Army International website.[95]
 General Brian Peddle has been world leader of the Salvation Army since August 3, 2018.
 The Salvation Army is one of the world's largest providers of social aid,[citation needed] with expenditures including operating costs of $2.6 billion in 2004, helping more than 32 million people in the U.S. alone. In addition to community centres and disaster relief, the organisation does work in refugee camps, especially among displaced people in Africa. The Salvation Army has received an A− rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy. In the United Kingdom, the Salvation Army is no longer the largest nongovernmental provider of social services; however, it still provides a significant service to people in need. The Salvation Army is the second largest charity in the United States, with private donations of almost $2 billion for the fiscal year ending 30 September 2007.[96] and is a member of the American organisation Christian Churches Together.[97]
 In 2004, the Army in the United States received a $1.6 billion donation in the will of Joan B. Kroc, third wife of former McDonald's CEO Ray Kroc. This donation was among the larger individual philanthropic gifts ever given to a single organisation. The donation came with certain restrictions that caused some controversy.[98]
 The International Congress of the Salvation Army is normally held every 10 years[99] as a conference for all Salvationists from around the world to meet. The first such conference took place in London, UK, from 28 May to 4 June 1886, and subsequent Congressional meetings were held sporadically until 1904 and then 1990.[100] The seventh International Congress in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, from 28 June to 2 July 2000, was the first held outside of the UK.[101]
The latest International Congress was held in London on 1–5 July 2015, in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the Salvation Army's founding.
 Officers are given Marching Orders to change ministries within the Salvation Army. Usually, officers are given new marching orders every two to five years and reassigned to different posts, sometimes moving great distances.
 In Russia the Army was founded around 1917[102] and the Army struggled on until 1922 at which point the situation had become extremely challenging.[103] A Moscow court ruled that the Salvation Army was a paramilitary organisation subject to expulsion. In October 2006, the European Court of Human Rights ruled the decision illegal.[104] The Salvation Army International website[105] lists the Russian Federation, now part of the Territory of Eastern Europe.[106]
William Booth's dying wish for the Salvation Army to be established in China[107] was fulfilled in a pledge made in 1912 Bramwell Booth to his father.[108] In 1915 the first officers were sent, and during the 1931 famine fed 100,000 people daily. Following political difficulties by 1952 the Army withdrew from the country but work still continues in the provinces of Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
In 1882 the Salvation Army was established in Asia with the first outpost in India.[109] The Army also established outposts in Australia in 1879, Japan in 1895 and China in 1915.
 The Salvation Army flag is a symbol of the Army's war against sin and social evils. The red on the flag symbolises the blood shed by Jesus Christ, the yellow for the fire of the Holy Spirit and the blue for the purity of God the Father.
 The oldest official emblem of The Salvation Army is the crest.
 In 1878 Captain W.H. Ebdon suggested a logo, and in 1879 it was to be found on the letterhead of the Salvation Army Headquarters. The captain's suggested design was changed only slightly and a crown was added.
 The Army's crest contains Biblical references though its symbolism:
 1  – The existence of a Holy God;  2 – The evil of sin are against God and man;  3  – There will be punishment for sin that is fair and everlasting;  4  – Jesus died on the cross for the human race;  5  – Salvation is for all mankind and is free to all who accept Jesus Christ;  6 – It is the responsibility of every Christian to do whatever they can do to spread the Gospel;  7 – God rewards those who are faithful with eternal life in Heaven with Him. The Red Shield has its origins in Salvation Army work during wartime. At the end of the 19th century, Staff-Captain Mary Murray was sent by William Booth to support British troops serving in the Boer War in South Africa. Then, in 1901, this same officer was given the task of establishing the Naval and Military League, the forerunner of the Red Shield Services.
 Salvation Army officers serving in the Red Shield Services in wartime performed many functions. The Doughnut Girls of World War I are an early example, serving refreshments to troops in the trenches. They also provided first aid stations, ambulances, chaplaincy, social clubs, Christian worship and other front-line services.[110]
 This symbol is still used in Blue Shield Services that serve the British Armed Forces but it is widely used as a simple, more readily identifiable symbol in many Salvation Army settings. It is common to see the Red Shield used on casual Salvation Army uniform. It is now official Salvation Army policy in the UK that the red shield should be used as the external symbol of the Salvation Army, with the Crest only being used internally. Therefore, any new Salvation Army building will now have the red shield on the outside rather than the crest which certainly would have been used on its Corps (church) buildings.[111]
 In Australia, the Red Shield has become one of the country's most identified and trusted symbols, leading the Australian Salvation Army to prefer to use this symbol over the logo on its uniform, corps buildings and advertising materials. In the 5th volume of Australian Superbrands it was recorded that ""Research reveals that the popular Salvation Army slogan 'Thank God for the Salvos' has almost total recognition amongst the Australian public, achieving 93 per cent aided awareness"".[112]
 Salvation Army officers, cadets[113] (trainee officers) and soldiers often wear uniforms. The idea that they should do so originated with Elijah Cadman who, at the Salvation Army's 'War Congress' in August 1878 said ""I would like to wear a suit of clothes that would let everyone know I meant war to the teeth and salvation for the world"". The uniform identifies the wearer as a Salvationist and a Christian. It also symbolises availability to those in need. The uniform takes many forms internationally but is characterised by the 'S' insignia for 'Salvation' and carries the meaning 'Saved to Serve', or 'Saved to Save'. Different colors and styles represent different ranks including soldiers, cadets, lieutenants, captains, majors, colonels, commissioner, and even the General.
 Characteristics of the uniform vary between ranks where accessories (the official term is ""trimings"") comprise epaulettes and hexagonal lapel patches.[114][citation needed] 
The uniform varies with the position and rank:
 Other letters are substituted to conform with local language. The words ""The Salvation Army"" are woven into the fabric of the uniform as a logo on shirts, blouses and jackets.
 Since 1983 there has been an official Salvation Army tartan. It was designed by Captain Harry Cooper, for the Perth Citadel Corps centenary commemoration in Scotland. It is based upon the colours of the Salvation Army flag, with which it shares the same symbolism. It is rarely seen outside Scotland.[115]
 The Salvation Army has a unique form of salute which involves raising the right hand above shoulder-height with the index finger pointing upwards. It signifies recognition of a fellow citizen of heaven, and a pledge to do everything possible to get others to heaven also.[116] In the case of saluting in response to applause, in circumstances such as a musical festival or being applauded for a speech, it also signifies that the Salvationist wishes to give Glory to God and not themselves. In some instances, the salute is accompanied with a shout of 'hallelujah!'
 In many countries, the Salvation Army is recognised during the Christmas season with its volunteers and employees who stand outside of businesses and play/sing Christmas carols, or ring bells to inspire passers-by to place donations of cash and cheques inside red kettles. A tradition has developed in the United States in which, in some places, gold coins or rings or bundles of large bills are anonymously inserted into the kettles. This was first recorded in 1982, in Crystal Lake, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[117][118]  The red kettles are not only used during the Christmas season though.  They are used throughout the year at other fundraising events, such as on National Doughnut Day in the U.S.  On this day, some donut shops that teamed up with the Salvation Army have a red kettle set up for donations. Each corps has a specific goal chosen for them by DHQ [Divisional Headquarters] which differs based on size and capability [119]
 The Red Shield Appeal and Self-Denial Appeal are annual fundraising campaigns in some territories, such as the UK and Australia. Each year, officers, soldiers, employees and volunteers take to the streets worldwide to participate in door-to-door or street collections. The money raised is specifically channelled towards The Salvation Army's social work in each respective territory. Within the territory defined by the United Kingdom and Ireland (UKIT) this collection is known as the Annual Appeal, and it often carries another name that the generally public would more readily know – in 2012 becoming The Big Collection.
 As the popularity of the organisation grew and Salvationists worked their way through the streets of London attempting to convert individuals, they were sometimes confronted with unruly crowds. A family of musicians (the Frys, from Alderbury, Wiltshire) began working with the Army as their ""bodyguards"" and played music to distract the crowds.[120] In 1891 a Salvation Army band attempted to parade and play music in Eastbourne, Sussex, England.  This was in contravention of local by-laws and resulted in the arrest of 9 Salvationists. Unperturbed the Army continued to parade in defiance of the law, with the aim of gathering support for a change in legislation.  Over the next few months the situation in the town escalated to such an extent that there were riots, and mounted police had to be called in from surrounding areas to try and maintain order.[121][122]
 The tradition of having musicians available continued and eventually grew into standard brass bands. These are still seen in public at Army campaigns, as well as at other festivals, parades and at Christmas. Across the world the brass band has been an integral part of the Army's ministry and an immediately recognisable symbol to Salvationists and non-Salvationists alike. The Salvation Army also has choirs; these are known as Songster Brigades, normally comprising the traditional soprano, alto, tenor and bass singers. The premier Songster Brigade in the Salvation Army is the International Staff Songsters (ISS). The standard of playing is high and the Army operates bands at the international level, such as the International Staff Band (a brass band) which is the equal of professional ensembles although it does not participate in the brass band contest scene, and territorial levels such as the New York Staff Band. Some professional brass players and contesting brass band personnel have Salvation Army backgrounds. Many Salvation Army corps have brass bands that play at Salvation Army meetings, although not all. The Salvation Army also fielded large concertina bands.  From the turn of the (20th) century to the Second World War between a third and a half of all SA officers in Britain played concertina.  For an evangelist the concertina's portability, its ability to play both melody and chords, and most especially the fact that the player can sing or speak while playing, were all distinct advantages over brass instruments.[123][124][125]
 The Army tradition in music is to use the popular idiom of the day to reach people for Jesus. The Army's Joy Strings were a hit pop group in the 1960s and early 1970s in the UK and beyond, reaching the charts and being featured on national television. Another popular band is The Insyderz, an American ska-core group popular in the 1990s and early 2000s. Hundreds of bands carry on this Salvation Army tradition, such as New Zealand's Moped, Chamberlain, Vatic, Agent C, and The Lads; England's Electralyte; Australia's Soteria Music Ministries, Summer Carnival Band, Crown of Thorns and Escape; and America's transMission, The Singing Company, HAB, BurN, and CJD – Cookies, Juice, & Donuts. Saytunes is a website designed to encourage and promote these contemporary Salvation Army bands and artists. Another significant musical feature of the Salvation Army is its use of tambourines. With coloured ribbons representing the colours of the Salvation Army flag, timbrels play an integral facet of music in the Salvation army. They are mainly played by women.
 In addition to books and magazines, the Salvation Army publishes sheet music[126] and Facebook groups run by Territories and Corps officers, and unofficial fan groups. Due to the way in which the Salvation Army is constituted, copyright of some Army publications is vested in the General of The Salvation Army, and not necessarily the original authors.[127]
 There are official social media accounts run by the Salvation Army on Twitter and Facebook.
 This is a list of books and magazines:
 General Bramwell Booth instituted the Order of the Founder on 20 August 1917[148] and the first awards were made in 1920 to one Soldier and 15 Officers.
General George Carpenter founded the Order Of Distinguished Auxiliary Service in 1941 to express the Salvation Army's gratitude for service given to the organisation by non-Salvationists.[149]
 Because the Salvation Army is a church, Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964 allows it to inquire into people's religious beliefs in its hiring practices. The Salvation Army states that it does not ""discriminate against hiring gays and lesbians for the majority of its roughly 55,000 jobs,""[150] but it has supported legislation which would allow it to deny employment and federally-funded services to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals.[151][152]
 In 1997 the city of San Francisco enacted a law requiring all companies doing business with the city government to extend domestic benefits to same-sex partners of employees.  In refusing to do so, the Salvation Army declined a US$3.5 million contract.[153] In 2001, the Salvation Army pressed the Bush Administration to exempt it and other religious groups from anti-discrimination legislation which it felt infringed on the organization's religious freedoms. This request was denied, and was sharply rebuked by David Smith, then-spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign. ""Gays and lesbians are taxpayers, too,"" said Smith. ""Their money should not be used by religious groups to fund discriminatory practices against them.""[150][154][155]
 The Salvation Army Western Territory approved a plan in October 2001 to start offering domestic partnership benefits to employees in same-sex relationships.[156] Members of various evangelical Christian interest groups protested the decision.  Focus on the Family founder James Dobson excoriated the Salvation Army for abandoning its ""moral integrity"" and urged his radio listeners to bombard the organisation's offices with phone calls and letters. The American Family Association also accused the Salvation Army of a ""monstrous ... appeasement of sin"" that resulted in a ""betrayal of the church"". In November 2001 the Salvation Army US-wide rescinded the Western Territory's decision with an announcement that it would only provide benefits coverage for different-sex spouses and dependent children of its employees.
 In 2004, the Salvation Army said that it would close operations in New York City unless it was exempted from a municipal ordinance requiring them to offer benefits to gay employees' partners. The City Council refused to make the exemption. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s administration chose not to enforce the ordinance. The administration's right to decline to enforce the ordinance was upheld by the New York State Court of Appeals in 2006.[157]
 On 15 December 2012, in Canada, Andrea Le Good noticed a Salvation Army bell-ringer carrying a sign reading ""if you support gay rights: please do not donate"". While the bell-ringer claimed he had permission from the charity to wear the sign, Salvation Army spokeswoman Kyla Ferns said that it had no part in the sign, and that the bell-ringer was pulled away immediately when the charity learned about it.[158] The charity's website describes marriage as heterosexual by definition, and a published document called on homosexuals to embrace celibacy as a way of life. The same document also states that there is no scriptural support for the mistreatment of homosexuals.[158]
 In February 2000, the Salvation Army in the United Kingdom publicly opposed the repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, which prevented local authorities from ""intentionally promot[ing] homosexuality"".[159] However, the organisation's UK website states that it offers ""unconditional assistance and support regardless of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, respecting the identity and choices of all those referred to them. ... As well as having a right to be dealt with professionally, people can expect from us encouragement and a respect for their individual beliefs, ambitions and preferences"".[160]
 Before the passing of the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986 by the New Zealand Parliament, the Salvation Army was active throughout New Zealand gathering signatures for a petition seeking to prevent the bill's passing. In 2006, the Army released a statement regretting the ill feelings that persisted following this activity. It stated in part ""We do understand though that The Salvation Army's official opposition to the Reform Bill was deeply hurtful to many, and are distressed that ill-feeling still troubles our relationship with segments of the gay community. We regret any hurt that may remain from that turbulent time and our present hope is to rebuild bridges of understanding and dialogue between our movement and the gay community.""[161]
 Despite documented events of Salvation Army's volunteers and their views, the organisation has issued an LGBT Statement as a response. The statement does not address any documented news events of discrimination and claims to debunk these events as urban myth.[162]
 In November 2013 it was made known that the Salvation Army was referring LGBT individuals to one of several conversion therapy groups.[162]  As a response the Salvation Army removed such referrals from their website.[163]
 A positional statement on the Salvation Army UK and Ireland site stated (but has since been taken down):
 The Salvation Army teaches that sexual acts should take place only in a monogamous heterosexual marriage, believing that this reflects God's intentions for sexual behaviour and provides the best environment for raising children.[164]
 The positional statement is, however, intended explicitly for members of the Salvation Army[165] and the Salvation Army mission statement as of 2013 states:
 The Salvation Army stands against homophobia, which victimises people and can reinforce feelings of alienation, loneliness and despair. We want to be an inclusive church community where members of the LGBT community find welcome and the encouragement to develop their relationship with God ... Our international mission statement is very clear on this point when it says we will ""meet human needs in [Jesus'] name without discrimination"". Anyone who comes through our doors will be welcomed with love and service, based on their need and our capacity to provide.[166]
 As of late 2013, activists were still calling on the Salvation Army to change its stance on LGBT issues, citing ongoing discrimination.[167][168]
 As of April 2018, the Inclusion page on the official UK website states that the Salvation Army stands against homophobia and does not permit discrimination in its employment practices or delivery of care.[169]
 On its USA Central Territory website, it explicitly claims that it serves and welcomes the LGBT community.[170]
 During the 2010 Christmas season, the Salvation Army in Calgary, Alberta, refused to accept toys based on the Harry Potter and Twilight franchises because of a perceived conflict with the organisation's religious principles. One volunteer claimed that the toys were destroyed instead of being given to other agencies. The volunteer also criticised the Salvation Army for accepting violence-themed toys such as plastic rifles while not accepting Harry Potter or Twilight toys. A Salvation Army captain said that the toys were given to other organisations, not disposed of.[171] This policy is however, not universal, as the Wetaskiwin chapter of the Salvation Army has accepted Harry Potter toys. One captain called the series ""a classic story of good winning over evil"".[172]
 Also during the 2010 Christmas season, the Salvation Army in Vancouver, BC, came under fire from advocacy group Families Against Crime & Trauma (FACT) for a program that provided goodie bags to federal inmates for Christmas by playing Santa to incarcerated criminals. The advocacy group called on the public to cease donations to the Salvation Army. Families Against Crime & Trauma takes a hardline position against criminal rehabilitation and objected to the gifts, however small, as undeserved rewards that should instead go to the victims of crime and their families.  The Salvation Army responded that their prisoner visitation program was established over a century ago and that they provided these particular services as contractors to the federal and provincial government, as such no charitable donations were spent on the program.[173]
 In 2004, the Salvation Army's New York division was named in a lawsuit filed by 18 current and former employees of its social service arm, claiming that the organisation asked about the religious and sexual habits of employees in programs funded by local and state government. One member claimed the organisation forced them to agree ""to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ"".[174] Proselytising or otherwise pursuing religious motives in a government-funded program is generally considered a violation of the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution. While the employment-discrimination portion of the lawsuit was dismissed in 2005, government agencies agreed in a 2010 settlement to set up monitoring systems to ensure that the Army did not violate church-state separation in its publicly funded projects. The organisation did not dispute allegations that nine-year-olds in a city-funded foster care program were put through a ""confirmation-like"" ceremony, where they were given Bibles and prayed over.[175]
 From the 1940s to the 1980s the Salvation Army in Australia sheltered approximately 30,000 children. In 2006 the Australian division of the Salvation Army acknowledged that sexual abuse may have occurred during this time and issued an apology. In it, the Army explicitly rejected a claim, made by a party unnamed in the apology, that there were as many as 500 potential claimants.[176]
 In 2013 it was reported that private settlements totalling A$15.5 million had been made in Victoria relating to 474 abuse cases; a Salvation Army spokesman said that ""This should not have happened and this was a breach of the trust placed in us"" and that they were ""deeply sorry"" whilst claiming that the abuse was ""the result of individuals and not a culture within the organization"".[177][178][179]
 On 28 January 2014, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, a royal commission of inquiry initiated in 2013 by the Australian Government and supported by all of its state governments,[180] began an investigation into abuse cases at the Alkira Salvation Army Home for Boys at Indooroopilly; the Riverview Training Farm (also known as Endeavour Training Farm) at Riverview –  both in Queensland; the Bexley Boys' Home at Bexley; and the Gill Memorial Home at Goulburn –  both in New South Wales. The investigation also examined the Salvation Army's processes in investigating, disciplining, removing and transferring anyone accused of or found to have engaged in child sexual abuse in these homes.[181][182][183][184] On 27 March 2014, the Royal Commission began an investigation into the handling by the Salvation Army (Eastern Territory) of claims of child sexual abuse between 1993 and 2014.[185][186][187]
 The Royal Commission published a case study report on the findings and recommendations for one of the above-mentioned case studies.[188]
 The Salvation Army has been criticized for making use of the UK Government's workfare schemes across Britain.[189] The UK campaign group Boycott Workfare lists them as a participant in Workfare.[190]
 The Salvation Army is featured in many popular movies such as Seabiscuit and Major Barbara. The Salvation Army is only briefly shown or discussed in these movies such as a bell ringer on the corner in the movie Maid in Manhattan, and briefly mentioned in Batman Begins.[191] The Salvation Army began producing silent films in the 1900s when they created Australia's first film studio.
 The Salvation Army started their own film studio called The Limelight Department in Australia beginning in 1892.[192] The original studio still stands today and is being preserved by the Salvation Army. One of the films included was a documentary called Inauguration of the Australian Commonwealth.[192] In the years between 1892 and 1909, The Limelight Department produced over 300 films and documented Australia's Federation Ceremonies in 1909.[192]"
Samaritan's Purse	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan%27s_Purse	"Samaritan's Purse is an evangelical Christian humanitarian aid organization that provides aid to people in physical need as a key part of Christian missionary work. The organization's president is Franklin Graham, son of Christian evangelist Billy Graham. The name of the organization is based on the New Testament Parable of the Good Samaritan, in which Jesus uses a parable to teach people one form of the Golden Rule; ""love your neighbor as yourself"".
 Samaritan's Purse works in more than 100 countries around the world. The international headquarters of Samaritan's Purse are in Boone, North Carolina, with additional U.S. facilities in Charlotte and North Wilkesboro, N.C. Affiliate offices are in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Hong Kong, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Field offices are located in some 20 countries across five continents.
 Bob Pierce founded Samaritan's Purse in 1970 with a vision ""to meet emergency needs in crisis areas through existing evangelical mission agencies and national churches.""  Pierce had previously founded World Vision in 1950.[2]
 Franklin Graham met Pierce in 1973, and they made several trips together to visit relief projects and missionary partners in Asia and elsewhere. Graham became president of Samaritan's Purse in 1979 following Pierce's death in 1978.[3]
 As the organization grew, Samaritan's Purse not only funded mission partners but also began to develop its own large-scale relief projects:[citation needed]
 The organisation's medical mission in Liberia, West Africa, was one of only two medical NGOs active in Liberia during the beginning of the  2014 Ebola outbreak. Samaritan's Purse and SIM USA both have been actively engaged in treating the recent outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Liberia. On August 1, 2014, the organisation announced that it was evacuating 60 nonessential personnel from Liberia. Dr. Kent Brantly, a Texas-based doctor working for the organisation, was the first U.S. Citizen to contract the Ebola virus in Liberia while treating the disease. He arrived in the United States on Saturday, August 2, and was treated and subsequently released after nearly three weeks in a special isolation unit of Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.[4][5][6][7] The organization recorded their mission in Liberia in the documentary Facing Darkness.[8] Samaritan's Purse also operates aircraft in support of its humanitarian relief efforts including a Douglas DC-8-72CF jetliner and a converted Douglas DC-3 featuring turboprop engines.[9]
 The organization's mission statement states that the organization seeks to meet the spiritual and physical needs of people suffering from war, poverty, disaster, disease, and famine, with the purpose of global missionary work attendant on humanitarian aid. The organization aims at service for the church worldwide to propagate ""the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ"".[10]
 Samaritan's Purse seeks to specialize in emergency relief, shelter, water and sanitation, food and nutrition, medical care and public health, HIV/AIDS, and community-based livestock and livelihood projects.
 Samaritan's Purse includes several ongoing ministries.
 Operation Christmas Child was created in 1990 by Dave Cooke and his wife Gill for children in Romania. Each November thousands of churches, schools, groups and individual donors prepare and collect shoeboxes filled with toys, school supplies, personal items, and other small gifts. A booklet of bible stories is often distributed alongside the shoebox gifts which are given to children based on need alone, regardless of their faith. These boxes are then distributed overseas by volunteers.[11] As of April 2015[update], over 124 million boxes have been delivered.[12]
 The program uses ""follow-up"" evangelism[13][14][15] with pamphlets of bible stories that are given to families that receive the boxes,[16] and an organizer for Operation Christmas Child says his goal every day is to ""expand [God's] kingdom through Operation Christmas Child.""[17]
 The ""follow-up"" evangelism program of Operation Christmas Child is called ""The Greatest Journey"". It's a 12 week discipleship program for children who receive shoebox gifts.[18]
 Operation Christmas Child in the US has over 9,000 year round volunteers and over 100,000 short term volunteers.
 The Operation Christmas Child project has been criticized in several countries, most notably in the UK,[19][20] but also in Ireland,[21] India[22] and Canada.[23] In the United States, Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, has stated that such religion-and-relief groups are ""using their position of power to try to persuade people to leave their faith.""[24] In 2003, The British supermarket chain Co-op and South Wales Fire Service both suspended their support for the project after numerous complaints about its religious connections.[25][26] Samaritan's Purse responded by stating that Christian literature was only handed out where it was deemed appropriate.[26]
 In October 2014, Samaritan's Purse was criticised in the UK for threatening legal action against the posters of online comments on the discussion forum Mumsnet. The resultant letters prompted one of the busiest discussions on the site's ""Am I being Unreasonable"" forum.[27]
 In the fiscal year ending December 2012, Samaritan's Purse generated over $376 million. Of that amount, 89.3 percent goes directly to projects; 4.3 percent is used for administrative support; and 6.2 percent is spent on fundraising.  The organization has received a 4 star rating (out of 4 stars) from the monitoring organization Charity Navigator.[28] The ""Consolidated Statement of Activities"" section of the organization's 2014 accountant's report lists the total revenue as $520.4 million.[29]
 In 2010, Flavia Wagner and two Sudanese men were kidnapped while working for Samaritan's Purse in Sudan. The two men were released promptly, but Wagner was held for three months. Upon her return to the US, Wagner sued Samaritan's Purse and their security contractor, Clayton Consultants, a hostage negotiation consultancy owned by Triple Canopy, accusing the organization ""of failing to train its security personnel adequately and of willfully ignoring warning signs that abductions were a threat to foreigners."" The organization settled out of court in March 2012.[30][31]
 In March 2001, The New York Times reported that Samaritan's Purse had ""blurred the line between church and state"" in the way it had distributed publicly funded aid to victims of the El Salvador earthquake. Residents from several villages stated they first had to sit through a half-hour prayer meeting before receiving assistance.[32] In a statement, USAID said Samaritan's Purse had not violated federal guidelines, but emphasized the need for the organization to ""maintain adequate and sufficient separation"" between prayer sessions and publicly funded activities.[33]
 In 2003, Samaritan's Purse was widely criticized within the United Kingdom after its president, Franklin Graham, stated that Islam is a ""very evil and wicked religion"",[34][25] leading to opposition campaigns within the United Kingdom by Islamic leaders.[35]  Samaritan's Purse responded to accusations of being anti-Islamic by highlighting their long history of non-denominational co-operation and charity work in Baghdad without attempting to preach or proselytize.[36]
 Franklin Graham drew scrutiny in 2009 for drawing a full-time salary from Samaritan's Purse, while at the same time receiving a full-time salary from Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA). This was called into question after his 2008 compensation from both organizations totaled $1.2 million.  (Most of this was the result of a new IRS rule that required him to re-report deferred retirement contributions that had already been reported over the previous three years.[37])  Some experts on non-profits have questioned whether one person can perform two full-time jobs leading organizations that employ hundreds and spend hundreds of millions around the world.[38]  In response to the questions about his compensation, Graham decided to give up his salary from BGEA, stating his calling to the ministry ""was never based on compensation.""  He also had contributions to his retirement plans suspended until the economy bounced back.[39] However, Graham was again criticized in 2015 when it was revealed he had again taken up his salary from BGEA, and that his annual compensation was significantly higher than that of the CEO's of similar but much larger non-profit organisations [40]
 In August 2013, Thankyou Group announced that it will no longer support Samaritan's Purse because it is not a signatory to the code of conduct run by the Australian Council for International Development, which bans aid as a vehicle for promoting religion or political groups.[41]"
Samsara Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsara_Foundation	"Funded by individual gifts and contributions from a variety of organizations, Samsara Foundation supports the education of underprivileged rural children. According to the organization, its mission is ""to contribute to the education and health of underprivileged children in rural areas of northern Thailand. Our intention is to help eradicate poverty....""
 Samsara was established in 2001 as a charitable foundation under Dutch law.  The foundation considers education key to poverty alleviation and to the development of Thailand from a poor to a more developed society. Now headquartered in Chiang Mai, in 2008 the organization received foundation status from the government of Thailand.
 Samsara works in northern Thailand - especially in one of the country's poorest provinces, Mae Hong Son. Priority is given to very basic and concrete projects like the installation of water purification systems, the building of kitchens and dormitories and the provision of educational tools. Besides these projects, Samsara provides scholarships for individual children who have promising school results but may not have the means to continue their studies without financial support.
 Samsara focuses its efforts on remote mountain villages, home to many hill tribes like the Karen people and the Hmong. The average annual income per family is around 10,000 baht (approximately €210, US$333).[1]
 Projects are managed by director Annelie Hendriks [2] - the founder, a volunteer and a Dutch national. Ratana Keunkeaw, a Thai citizen, assists her. They work in close collaboration with the Department of Education in Mae Sariang District and with the directors of the schools involved.
 Samsara's philosophy is to seek and actively promote the participation of the community. Villagers therefore do most of the construction work voluntarily. Many of them are parents of the schoolchildren. This contributes to a better relationship between school and village, and promotes support for education within the community.
 Most of the schools in the mountains of Mae Sariang District (185 schools with 27,000 children[1]) are only accessible in the dry season. The rainy season makes it difficult to use the small, muddy and slippery roads. Construction and monitoring therefore must be accomplished in a seven-month period (November through May).
 One Samsara project may provide several different benefits to a single school or similar benefits to several schools. Further, some schools have been the recipients of improvements from more than one project.
 Since 2002 Samsara Foundation has provided the following facilities, services and amenities at schools in northern Thailand: 41 school dormitories; 25 school canteens; five school libraries; 16 toilet buildings; water purification installations at 73 schools; ten cement rainwater collecting tanks; for 48 schools, books; for 44 schools, furniture and small facilities; for 100 schools, medicines; 	for 40 schools, teaching materials for children with special needs; for many children, hundreds of one-year scholarships.
 In 2008 Samsara began an initiative called “Tomorrow's Leaders”. Under the terms of this program, hill tribe children with top school marks will be offered an opportunity to continue their education at vocational school or university for up to six years. Samsara's ordinary scholarship program funds uniforms, school fees, learning materials and (if necessary) dormitory accommodation for children from very poor families.
 Samsara's work is made possible through partnerships with a number of individuals, family foundations and with internationally active charitable organizations. The latter include Rotary International, several Rotary clubs, and such other organizations as the Alberta Government's Wild Rose Foundation and Wilde Ganzen foundation of the Netherlands. Another major partner is the Mae Sariang school district, which participates actively in helping to implement foundation projects."
Santa Casa da Misericórdia	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Casa_da_Miseric%C3%B3rdia	"Santa Casa da Misericórdia is a Portuguese charity founded in Lisbon in 1498 by  Queen Leonor of Portugal.[1]
 It declares itself to be a Catholic lay brotherhood and to work through 14 Works of Mercy, seven of a spiritual nature: to teach the humble, to give good advice, to punish those who do wrong, to console the sad, to pardon offenses, to suffer patiently, to pray for the living and for the deceased; and seven of a corporeal nature: to visit the ill and imprisoned, to free captives, to clothe the naked, to feed the hungry and thirsty, to shelter  travelers and to bury the dead.[2] It is currently the oldest working NGO in the world, if not the first. It isn't supervised by the Church or the State. 
 After the Lisbon Santa Casa da Misericóridia de Lisboa,[3] similar organizations were created in many other cities and towns of Portugal and of the former Portuguese Empire, like in Brazil, Macau and even in Nagasaki, Japan.[4]
 The União das Misericórdias Portuguesas (UMP) (in Portuguese) provides additional information on the Misericórdias in Portugal and throughout the world. Currently, there are 388 active Misericórdias in Portugal and over 2000 similar organizations in Brazil.[5]"
Save the Children	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_the_Children	"The Save the Children Fund,[2] commonly known as Save the Children was established in the United Kingdom in 1919 in order to improve the lives of children through better education, health care, and economic opportunities, as well as providing emergency aid in natural disasters, war, and other conflicts.
 In addition to the UK organisation, there are 29 other national Save the Children organisations who are members of the Save the Children Alliance, a global network of nonprofit organisations supporting local partners and Save the Children International in more than 120 countries around the world. Further, Save the Children has been involved in other initiatives through partners such as Bernard Arnault Africa Relief (BAAR International), which has operations in various parts of Kenya such as Elgeyo Marakwet, Kajiado, Homa Bay, Narok, Makueni and Machakos, as well as Southern Sudan.
 The organisation promotes policy changes in order to gain more rights for young people[3] especially by enforcing the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child. Alliance members co-ordinate emergency-relief efforts, helping to protect children from the effects of war and violence.[4] Save the Children has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. In 2016, former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt was appointed Chief Executive.
 The Save the Children Fund was founded in London, England, on 15 April 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton as an effort to alleviate starvation of children in Germany and Austria-Hungary during the Allied blockade of Germany of World War I which continued after the Armistice.[5]
 The Fight the Famine Council was initially started earlier in 1919 in order to put political pressure on the British government to end the blockade, the first meeting having been held at the home of Catherine Courtney, at 15 Cheyne Walk. However, on 15 April 1919, the sisters succeeded in separating itself from the politics of the Council and creating a separate ""Save the Children Fund"".[5]
 In May 1919, the Fund was publicly established at a meeting in London's Royal Albert Hall in order to ""provide relief to children suffering the effects of war"" and raise money for emergency aid to children suffering from the wartime shortages of food and supplies.[6][7]
 In December 1919, Pope Benedict XV publicly announced his support for Save the Children, and declared 28 December 'Innocents Day' in order to collect donations.[8]
 The first branch was opened in Fife, Scotland in 1919. A counterpart, Rädda Barnen (which means ""Save the Children""), was founded later that year in Sweden with Anna Kleman on the board.[9] Along with a number of other organisations, they founded the International Save the Children Union in Geneva on 6 January 1920. Jebb built up excellent relationships with other Geneva-based organisations, including the Red Cross who supported Save's International foundation.[5]
 Jebb used many ground-breaking fund-raising techniques, making Save the Children the first charity in the United Kingdom to use page-length advertisements in newspapers. Jebb contracted doctors, lawyers and other professionals in order to devise mass advertisement campaigns. In 1920, Save the Children started individual child sponsorship as a way to engage more donors. By the end of the year, Save the Children raised the equivalent to about £8,000,000 in today's money.[8]
 By August 1921, the UK Save the Children had raised over £1,000,000, and conditions for children in Central Europe were improving due to their efforts. However, the Russian famine of 1921 made Jebb realise that Save the Children must be a permanent organisation and that children's rights constantly need to be protected.[10] Their mission was thus changed to ""an international effort to preserve child life wherever it is menaced by conditions of economic hardship and distress"".[8]
 From 1921 to 1923, Save the Children created press campaigns, propaganda movies and feeding centres in Russia and in Turkey in order to feed and educate thousands of refugees. They began to work with several other organisations such as the Russian Famine Relief Fund and Nansen which resulted in recognition by the League of Nations. Although Russia was largely closed off to international relief and aid, Save the Children persuaded Soviet authorities to let them have a ground presence.[5]
 At home, the Daily Express criticised the Fund's work, denying the severity of the situation and arguing they should be helping their own people before helping Russia. The charity responded with increased publicity about the famine, showing images of starving children and mass graves. The campaign gained national appeal, eventually allowing the organisation to charter the SS Torcello to Russia with 600 tons' worth of relief supplies. Over 157 million rations were given out, saving nearly 300,000 children. Improved conditions meant Save the Children's Russian feeding program was able to be closed in the summer of 1923, after having won international acclaim.[5][11]
 At the end of World War II, images of malnourished and sick children ran throughout Europe. Jebb and her sister worked to gain public sympathy in order to elicit support aid.[12] Save the Children staff were among the first into the liberated areas after World War II, working with refugee children and displaced persons in former occupied Europe, including survivors of Nazi concentration camps. At the same time, work in the United Kingdom focused on improving conditions for children growing up in cities devastated by bombing and facing huge disruptions in family life.[8]
 The 1950s saw a continuation of this type of crisis-driven work, with additional demands for help following the Korean War and the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, but also the opening of new work in Africa, Asia and the Middle East in response to the decline of the British empire.[8]
 Like other aid agencies, Save the Children was active in the major disasters of the era—especially the Vietnam War and the Biafra secession in Nigeria. The latter brought shocking images of child starvation onto the television screens of the West for the first time in a major way. The sort of mass-marketing campaigns first used by Save the Children in the 1920s was repeated, with great success in fundraising.
 Disasters in Ethiopia, Sudan, and many other world hotspots led to appeals which brought public donations on a huge scale, and a consequent expansion of the organisation's work. However, the children's rights-based approach to development originated by Jebb continues to be an important factor. It was used in a major campaign in the late 1990s against the use of child soldiers in Africa.[8]
 During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, new cases outnumber the available hospital beds in the country. Save the Children is working with the UK government's Department for International Development and Ministry of Defence to build and run a 100-bed treatment centre in Sierra Leone, as well as supporting an Interim Care Center in Kailahun for children who have lost their families to Ebola.[13]
 In 1923, Jebb wrote: ""I believe we should claim certain rights for the children and labour for their universal recognition, so that everybody--not merely the small number of people who are in a position to contribute to relief funds, but everybody who in any way comes into contact with children, that is to say the vast majority of mankind--may be in a position to help forward the movement.""[14]
 Jebb created an initial draft for what would become the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child in 1923. It contained the following five criteria:
 These five points were adopted by the League of Nations in 1924 and were thus known as the Declaration of Geneva. This was the first important assertion of the rights of children as separate from adults and began the process that would lead to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the United Nations in 1989.[5]
 Following the atrocities of World War II, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. However, many felt the rights of children needed to be addressed in further detail with a separate document.
 In November 1959, the UN General Assembly altered Jebb's initial criteria in order to produce the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. This consisted of ten non-binding principles for states to follow in order to work in the best interests of the child. However, this 1959 declaration was not legally binding and was only a statement of general principles and intent.[15]
In 1989, however, it was adopted by the UN General Assembly. On 2 September 1990 it became international law.[15]
 The Convention consists of 54 articles that address the basic human rights that all children are entitled to: the right to survival; development to the fullest; protection from harmful influences, abuse and exploitation; and full participation in family, cultural and social life.[15] The four core principles of the convention are non-discrimination; devotion to the best interests of the child; the right to life, survival, and development; and respect for the views of the child.
 Today, the Convention serves as the basis for all of Save the Children's work. It has been ratified in every country around the world, with the exception of the United States.[16]
 Rewrite the Future is Save the Children's first global campaign involving all 28 members of the Save the Children Alliance. Beginning in 2006, the campaign focuses on obtaining equal and quality education for children who are unable to attend school due to conflict or war. The campaign is focused in 28 states where armed conflict is particularly relevant including Afghanistan, Angola, Colombia, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Indonesia, Liberia, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Sri Lanka, and Uganda.[17]
In 2008, Save the Children surpassed its goal of improving educational standards for eight million children by reaching over 10 million.
 The Every One Campaign was started in October 2009 as a result of the Millennium Development Goals created in 2000. The fourth goal aims to reduce the child mortality rate by two-thirds by 2015. Save the Children is working to achieve this goal through their Every One Campaign and their seven step program stating:[18]
 The Every Beat Matters campaign, started in August 2012,[19] aims to end preventable child deaths. Every year, more than 7 million children die before their 5th birthday, largely due to preventable and treatable causes like pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria.[20] As part of the campaign, OneRepublic created the new song ""Feel Again"". Lead singer Ryan Tedder was inspired to write the song by listening to heartbeats of children in need in remote villages in Malawi and Guatemala.[21] Proceeds from the sale of ""Feel Again"" on iTunes[22] will benefit Save the Children, which trains frontline health workers to save children's lives around the world. In developing countries, frontline health workers are often the only link to health care for children who live beyond the reach of hospitals and clinics. They can provide a range of proven, lifesaving services including maternal and newborn care, child health, and management of chronic and communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, AIDS and diabetes. Yet according to the World Health Organization, there is a global shortage of at least one million frontline health workers.[23]
 In 2014 to mark the three-year anniversary of the Syrian civil war Save the Children released a campaign video about what life would be like for British kids if a civil war erupted in London.[24] The video reached over 20 million views in less than a week.[25] The ad has been described as ""powerful""[26] and ""unsettling"".[27]
 Samantha Cameron is an ambassador for the charity Save the Children. Her husband, David Cameron, has resisted calls for the United Kingdom to accept more refugees from Syria. In March 2013, Samantha Cameron said: ""As a mother, it is horrifying to hear the harrowing stories from the children I met today, no child should ever experience what they have. With every day that passes, more children and parents are being killed, more innocent childhoods are being smashed to pieces.""[28][29]
 Save the Children is an international umbrella organisation, with 30 national organisations serving over 120 countries.[30]
 All members of the alliance are bound by the International Save the Children Alliance Bylaws which includes The Child Protection Protocol and Code of Conduct. These set a standard for common values, principles, and beliefs.[31]
 The Save the Children website states that the member organisations work towards achieving four key initiatives:
 Save the Children helps to fund, and is aided with funds raised by, the British will-making scheme Will Aid, in which participating solicitors waive their usual fee to write a basic will and in exchange invite the client to donate to charity.[32] Save the Children collaborates with other NGOs in Family Tracing and Reunification.[33]
 Charity Navigator gave Save the Children US a three-star rating (score 88.30 of 100) in 2018 and reported that Save the Children US's CEO Carolyn Miles earned a salary of 459,969 USD in 2016.[34]
 Charity Watch reported earnings of 499,238 USD for Save the Children US's President and CEO Carolyn S. Miles, 383,771 USD for Executive Vice President and COO Carlos Carrazana, and 299,278 USD for the Vice President in charge of Policy & Human Resources Michael Klosson for the year 2015.[35]
 In 1969, Save the Children UK commissioned film director Ken Loach and producer Tony Garnett to make The Save the Children Fund Film.[36] The resulting film was unacceptable to the organisation because they felt it presented their work in an unfavourable light.[37] Eventually a legal agreement was arrived at which involved the material being deposited in the National Film Archive.[37][38] In 2011, roughly 42 years later, it was shown to the public for the first time in decades.[37][39]
 In July 2011, a fake vaccination program by the CIA was uncovered.[40] It then emerged that Dr. Shakil Afridi, the person organising the CIA's ""vaccinations"", had claimed that he was a Save the Children employee. In May 2012, Save the Children's country director for Pakistan, David Wright, revealed that the organisation's work had been badly disrupted ever since Afridi had made his claim, with medicines held up for long periods at airports, staff unable to get visas, and so forth. Wright also charged that the CIA had breached international humanitarian law and risked the safety of aid groups worldwide.[41] ""It was a setback, no doubt,"" said Dr. Elias Durry, the World Health Organization's polio coordinator for Pakistan, a few months later.[42] Later that year, in September, it was reported that the Pakistani government had requested Save the Children's foreign staff to leave the country,[43] In January 2013, the Deans of twelve top US schools of public health sent a letter to President Obama protesting against the entanglement of intelligence operations in public health campaigns. The letter describes the negative and lasting impacts of the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) use of a fake vaccination campaign in Pakistan during the hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011, which exacerbated the already persistent public mistrust of vaccines in the country.[44]
 The CIA's ""vaccination program"" sparked a series of deadly attacks in Pakistan against dozens of aid and health workers associated with polio eradication campaigns, with the UN-backed polio-vaccination drive repeatedly halted as a result.[45][46][47] In May 2014, the Obama administration announced that they would no longer use vaccination programs as a cover for CIA activities.[47]
 Pakistani investigators said in a July 2012 report that Dr. Shakil Afridi met 25 times with ""foreign secret agents, received instructions and provided sensitive information to them.""[48] According to an early draft of a Pakistan Government report, which has not been publicly released, Afridi told investigators that the charity Save the Children helped facilitate his meeting with US intelligence agents although the charity denies the charge. The report alleges that Save the Children's Pakistan director at the time of the incident introduced Afridi to a western woman in Islamabad and that Afridi and the woman met regularly afterwards.[49][50][51]
 The claim that the Save the Children Country Director had introduced Afridi to the woman is not credible, as the Country Director concerned had left Pakistan permanently well before the alleged meeting took place. The allegation does not appear in subsequent drafts of the report, although the document has still not been publicly released.
 On 11 June 2015, Pakistani authorities ordered all Save the Children workers to leave Pakistan within 15 days, and the organisation's office in Islamabad was closed and padlocked.[52]
 In 2014, Tony Blair was given Save the Children's Global Legacy Award by the leadership of the US arm of the charity at a gala dinner in New York.[53] A furious protest letter condemning the award was signed by over 500 Save the Children staff, who said it was ""morally reprehensible"" and jeopardised the organisation's credibility.[54][55] The episode raised questions about the links between those who had given the award and those close to Blair.[56]
 In November 2015, Mail Online reported that Chief strategist of Save the Children UK Brendan Cox resigned in September over allegations of ‘inappropriate behaviour’. Mr Cox, who was the director of policy and advocacy at Save the Children UK, left after members of staff made complaints about him.[57]
 Cox had previously denied any wrongdoing but finally admitted to inappropriate behaviour in 18 February 2018 and quit working for his two other charities.[58][59]
 On 22 February 2018 former Save the Children UK chief executive Justin Forsyth resigned from UNICEF to avoid ""damage"" to the charities. Three complaints of inappropriate behaviour were made of Mr. Forsyth whilst he worked at Save the Children UK.[60]
 On 24 January 2018, militants affiliated with Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province launched a bomb and gun attack on a Save the Children office in Jalalabad, a city in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar, killing six people and injuring 27.[61][62]"

 Save the Manatee (SMC) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit group and membership organization dedicated to the conservation of manatees.[1] The organization was founded in 1981 by singer and songwriter Jimmy Buffett, and Governor of Florida (and later U.S. Senator) Bob Graham.[2] There are currently about 40,000 active members of SMC.
 Save the Manatee Club raises funds from the Adopt-A-Manatee program to go toward public awareness and education projects, manatee research, rescue and rehabilitation efforts, and advocacy and legal action to ensure better protection for manatees and their habitat.[3] The Club has also assisted state and federal governments with research projects in Florida such as aerial surveys, seagrass studies, telemetry studies, manatee photo identification projects, population modeling and the compilation of over twenty years of research on the population of Blue Spring manatees.[4]
 Save the Manatee Club provides funds, supplies, and other essential equipment to Wildtracks, Belize's only manatee rehabilitation facility. SMC has assisted the Puerto Rico Manatee Conservation Center in raising critical funds needed to repair damage sustained by Hurricane Maria. They also partner with villages in Nigeria, part of the West African manatee’s habitat, providing funding and collaborating with villagers to develop an alternative livelihoods program that provides manatee poachers with a sustainable and legal alternative to taking manatees. Additionally, SMC helps the Caribbean Stranding Network in Puerto Rico provide care for orphaned and injured manatees.
 Save the Manatee Club's membership program is called Adopt-A-Manatee. This program was conceived by Jimmy Buffett in 1984 as a way to increase awareness of the manatee's plight and to get the public involved in their conservation. Today, people can adopt a manatee and become a member of SMC for as little as $25 USD. Currently, the Club has 34 living manatees with known histories available for adoption as well as three memorial adoptions for manatees that have died.[5] The proceeds from this program go toward public awareness and education programs; manatee research, rescue and rehabilitation efforts; and advocacy and legal action to ensure better protection for manatees and their habitat.[6]
 On behalf of Save Crystal River, Inc., Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF) petitioned the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to downlist the West Indian Manatee (trichechus manatus) from an endangered to threatened species. PLF contends that FWS has a legal duty, under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), to implement this reclassification, because the species no longer qualifies as endangered.[7]
 On March 30, 2017, FWS issued its final rule to downgrade the status of the West Indian manatee from endangered to threatened under the ESA. The rule affects both the Florida and Antillean subspecies and was pursued despite strong scientific and legal evidence that shows the downlisting of manatees is not warranted at this time. SMC believes the FWS decision failed to adequately consider data from 2010 to 2016, during which time manatees suffered from unprecedented mortality events linked to habitat pollution, dependence on artificial warm water sources, and record deaths from watercraft strikes.[8] SMC is currently active in opposing the downlisting.
 According to the FWS the criteria that need to be meet in order to add a species to the endangered species list, and to keep them there are: 1. the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; 2. overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; 3. disease or predation; 4. the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; 5. other natural or man-made factors affecting its survival.[9] Any one of these conditions is adequate to add a species to the list. However, manatees, and the Florida manatee in particular, are still at substantial risk from habitat loss and motorboat accidents. Additionally, a red tide outbreak at the beginning of 2016 and throughout 2018, and a shortage of FWS personnel to appropriately enforce its regulations regarding endangered species, put the manatee at even greater risk."
Scaife Family Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaife_Family_Foundation	"The Scaife Foundations refer collectively to three foundations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The three subdivisions are: the Allegheny Foundation, the Sarah Scaife Foundation, and the Scaife Family Foundation. A fourth foundation, the Carthage Foundation, was folded into the Sarah Scaife Foundation in 2014.[1]
 Richard Mellon Scaife endowed the foundation and served as the chairman.  It makes grants to historical, educational, political, and pro- and anti-environmental organizations, especially those located in or serving Western Pennsylvania.  From 1985 to 2006 the foundation awarded over $36 million to other organizations.[2]
 In 2007, the Allegheny Foundation made grants of $3,195,500 to 45 organizations.  The five organizations receiving the largest grants were:[3]
 The 2007 annual report also noted that, at the end of that year, the foundation had nearly $55 million in cash and common stocks.
 The Sarah Scaife Foundation does not award grants to individuals.  It concentrates its efforts towards politically conservative causes focused on public policy at a national and international level.[4] From 1985 to 2003 the organization awarded over $235 million to other organizations.
 The organizations it has supported include the George C. Marshall Institute, Project for the New American Century, the Institute for Humane Studies,[5] Reason Foundation,[6] and Judicial Watch.
 Prior to its 2014 merger, like the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the Carthage Foundation did not award grants to individuals.  It concentrated its efforts towards causes focused on public policy at a national and international level.  From 1985 to 2003 the organization awarded over $68 million to other organizations.
 The Scaife Family Foundation does not award grants to individuals.[citation needed]  It concentrates its efforts towards causes focused on families, women, children, and animal welfare.  From 1985 to 2001 the organization awarded over $77 million to other organizations.[citation needed]
 A 2013 Smithsonian Magazine article listed the Foundation as among the largest contributors to the climate change counter-movement from 2003 to 2010.[7]"
SCARE for a CURE	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_for_a_Cure	"SCARE for a CURE is an Austin, Texas-based nonprofit organization that raises money for local charities, including the Breast Cancer Resource Centers. Each year they produce an ""extreme, full contact, interactive haunted house adventure""[1] that runs around 45 minutes to an hour long. This combination of interactive adventure game and haunted house was pioneered by Richard Garriott at his Britannia Manor haunted attraction which began in 1988 and ran every two years until 1994.  The torch was passed to Keith Ewing, former Britannia Manor construction manager, and continued in Wild Basin's Haunted Trails every year from 1996 to 2005.[2][3]
 What makes these three haunts a unique performance medium is the emphasis on script and story similar to a play, but with an emphasis on interactive elements including making the audience play the role of the main character.[4] It also requires a significant physical contribution from the guests, not simply walking through, but running, climbing, crawling, sliding, and occasionally swimming and/or rowing. As their website puts it, SCARE is ""a story-driven, theatrical horror experience presented across 26 stages.""[5]
 Volunteers from all over Austin and the surrounding area come together for this elaborate performance that generally runs during the last two weeks of October.  High school drama troupes and Britannia Manor and Haunted Trails veterans continue to make up a significant portion of the volunteer pool, but they have been joined through the years by many members of the Elk's Lodge, as well as general theatre and Halloween enthusiasts from the Austin area.  The significant presence of movie, video game, and stage industries in Austin provides a large pool of talented individuals.  Local fiction writers, video game companies, and the Texas school for the blind are frequent contributors as well.
 SCARE for a CURE has two separate historical roots which came together in 2007.
 Much of the original concept of a story-based, full touch interactive theatre style of haunted attraction came from Britannia Manor and was carried on by a core group of dedicated volunteers for a decade in Wild Basin's Haunted Trails, before that group of volunteers combined efforts with Jarrett Crippen and SCARE for a CURE.
 The other beginning was in Jarrett ""The Defuser"" Crippen's back yard charity haunt that he did for several years before SCARE for a CURE officially began.  Jarrett Crippen, a detective in the Austin Police Department, and winner of the second season of reality show, ""Who Wants to be a Superhero?,"" put on an elaborate haunt in his home and yard asking for donations to various charities, such as cans of food for the Austin Food Bank, as admission.  Local high school drama troupes provided much of the acting talent.
 2005 was both the last year of Wild Basin's Haunted Trails[6][7] and also the last year that Jarrett Crippen put on a haunted house in his back yard.  More than 1000 people went through Crippen's house and yard in the three-day run of his charity haunted house, which had been dubbed Scare for a Cure by then.  This caused major difficulties with traffic in his neighborhood which necessitated the intervention of traffic control officers.[8]
 Both the Wild Basin Haunted Trails volunteer group and Jarrett Crippen took a year off.
 Wild Basin donated all the props, flats and other materials that had been stored from Haunted Trails to Crippen for use in his new haunted attraction.  The experienced floating volunteer pool, many of whom had been doing haunts for more than ten years, beginning at Britannia Manor, transferred their energy to Crippen's effort.[9]  Crippen, and many of the key volunteers belonged to the BPOE (Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks).  The Austin Elk's Lodge #201 provided SCARE for a CURE a prime location for a large scale haunt that could handle the traffic levels and other demands.  Half the proceeds of SCARE were donated to Elk's Lodge scholarships, with the other half going to the Austin Breast Cancer Resource Centers.[10] Crippen's fame as a recent reality show winner undoubtedly contributed to the level of media coverage.[11][12]  More than $12,000 was raised for SCARE sponsored charities.
 The show was dubbed ""Phobia Asylum"" that year and the premise was that guests would be cured of their phobias, regardless of their nature by a radical new treatment which involved special chemically altered spider venom, and repeated exposure to the object of fear.[13]
 There was an odd challenge involved from ""Lord Vile"" local Austin self-styled super-villain who was also running a haunted house in Austin. If his haunted house got more customers than SCARE on nights when they both ran, half of his proceeds would go to SCARE charities.  If Lord Vile's haunt got more customers, he would donate half of his proceeds to NORML.[14]
 In 2008, a board of directors was elected, and the process of incorporating into a non-profit organization began.  The Elks Lodge again hosted the performance, and half of the proceeds went to the Elks Lodge scholarship fund. The other half of the proceeds went to four $2500 scholarships awarded to Austin area high school students whose lives had been adversely affected by cancer, either by losing a close family member, or in one case, by being diagnosed with cancer, themselves.[15]  In 2008, volunteer hours were tracked for the first time resulting in totals of over 8000 hours from more than 200 volunteers.[16]
 The SCARE theme was ""video games gone wrong"" and the sub-title was ""World of Horrorcraft.""[17]  The basic premise was that a new technology had been invented that allowed players to upload their consciousness into video games so they could play directly, rather than through pushing buttons on a controller.  Naturally, things go horribly wrong from there, thanks to an evil artificial intelligence named A.L.I.C.E. and the dastardly behind-the-scenes shenanigans of the technology creator, Dunstan Interactive Entertainment (DIE).[18]
 In 2009, SCARE announced that they are moving to a new location.  Richard Garriott has become a sponsor, and allowed them to build this year's haunt on the location of his partially completed mansion, which he refers to as Britannia Manor Mark 2.[19] This is being hinted at as a return of the famous haunt, Britannia Manor, but Garriott's level of involvement may be minimal, aside from providing a venue.  Jarrett Crippen is still listed as the director.
 SCARE has returned to the 2007 charity of Austin Breast Cancer Resource Centers for the full amount of the proceeds, with a general intention of having Austin BCRC as their primary ongoing charity.  501-C non-profit papers have been filed, and regular monthly board meetings are now held in conjunction with the haunt script and planning meetings.
 The sub-title for this year is ""Blood Ritual"" with a general vampire related theme.  The premise is that the guests have come to interview for the chance to join the Researchers In the Paranormal (RIP), a paranormal investigation organization.  As rookie RIPpers, they will have a chance to prove themselves in a genuine investigation of the possible reappearance of Britannia Manor.  Unbeknownst to the RIPpers, they are being used by a cabal of vampires in their attempt to raise an all powerful demon and rule the world.  It's up to the guests to find a way to foil their evil plot, and get out alive.[20]
 Zombie Apocalypse
 The theme for the 2011 Haunted House was ""Carnival of Lost Souls"" in which participants meet the ringmaster of a carnival who sends them into a field of ruins to find his lost talisman. Players must watch out for Chuckles, a man-eating clown, and Ivo, the evil brother of the ringmaster.
 Summer Camp Massacre
 The theme for 2013 was Fairy Tale Nightmare.  Fairy tale archaeologists had visited their subjects of study and brought back artifacts from the fictitious world to showcase in their museum.  But their excursions also brought about a change in the stories themselves.  Now guests must travel into this other realm to put the stories right - but the new and twisted fairy tale characters may have other plans...
 In addition to the haunt, this year featured 2 new attractions: an interactive ghost town murder mystery and a maze, also known as the Boneyard.  The murder mystery consisted of groups of guests traveling from one vignette to another, attempting to unravel the secret of the ghost town by talking to its dearly departed residents.  The boneyard was a wooden maze where guests must find a way out, but beware: your group may not be the only ones trapped within the walls - and the denizens of the boneyard only get to hunt once a year...
 Due to popular demand, the haunt is doing its first ever sequel: Return to Zombie Wasteland.
It's been 40 years since the zombie virus devastated humanity. No more grocery stores, no more gas stations. No more reality TV. But if you can make it to the City of Prosper, you might have a chance of surviving the Return to Zombie Wasteland.
 There will also be another high octane maze experience, the Slaughterhouse."
Schowalter Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schowalter_Foundation	"The Schowalter Foundation is a Kansas-based Mennonite philanthropic foundation formed in 1954 from the estate of Jacob A. Schowalter of Newton, Kansas.
 Initially funded with an estate of $1,157,000,[2] the foundation's assets reached $10,298,000 in 2003 ranking among the top thirty Kansas foundations.[3] Income from the foundation's assets are used for relief work, training of missionaries and ministers and promotion of peace.

Serving Charity	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serving_Charity	"Serving Charity is an international interfaith non-profit organization based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Its mission is to serve the poor through charity and selfless service. Mother Teresa of Calcutta is expressed to be the sole inspiration for the organization and all of its initiatives.[1]
 Serving Charity was founded in 2003 by Abbas Jahangiri.[2] He is also the former owner of the historical music venue el Mocambo and other companies.[3]
 Serving Charity is entirely run by volunteers. It resides and is primarily supported by the revenue from the el Mocambo.[4]
 The organization has charity projects in seven countries; Canada, India, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Germany, Iran, and Vietnam. In 2010 Serving Charity opened its first orphanage in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, for orphaned or abandoned Haitian refugee children.[2] The organization is most recognized for its soup kitchen in Toronto where volunteers come to makes sandwiches and go out to feed the homeless every night from 2:00AM–6:00AM.[5][6]

 On October 2, 2014, Nicholas and Jill Woodman, founders of GoPro, a high tech wearable camera company, announced that they would donate $500 million to Silicon Valley Community Foundation.[17]
 In 2014, Jan Koum, founder of WhatsApp donated close to $556 million to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation to set up a donor-advised fund.[18]
 Silicon Valley Community Foundation created and hosted Silicon Valley Gives,[19] the Bay Area's first 24-hour giving day, on May 6, 2014. The giving event was sponsored by John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Microsoft, NBC Bay Area as well as over 100 other individuals, foundations and companies. The event was hosted on online donation platform Razoo. The event raised $8,000,833 with 14,889 unique donors and more than 21,869 donations.[20][21] SVCF also hosted more than 20 trainings for more than 650 local nonprofits to help them capacity build leading up to the event.[22][23]
 Paul Allen has opened a fund for Tackle Ebola[24] with Silicon Valley Community Foundation.[25]
 A senior staff member resigned.  The Foundation hired a law firm to investigate the associated claims of sexual harassment from Mari Ellen Loijens over the course of many years.[26]  A few days later, the CEO, Emmett Carson, was placed on paid leave.[27][28]  Two months later, the CEO's employment ""ended"" and the resignation of the head of H.R. was accepted, as an investigation ""found that many allegations from current and former employees were substantiated.""[29][30]
 As a donor-advised fund, the Foundation allows donors to claim a tax benefit immediately but indefinitely defer when they transfer the assets.[31] The fund also isn't legally required to distribute any assets, like family foundations are, so there is little pressure to move money.[32]
 The timing of prominent donations to the foundation has led to accusations of the Foundation being used as a tax loophole. Both Mark Zuckerberg and Nick Woodman donated near the same time as their companies' IPOs, and the founders of WhatsApp donated shortly after their company's acquisition.[33]"
Simone and Cino Del Duca Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_and_Cino_Del_Duca_Foundation	"The Simone and Cino Del Duca Foundation is a charitable foundation based in Paris, France. It was established in 1975 by Simone Del Duca (1912–2004), widow of publishing magnate Cino Del Duca (1899–1967). The Foundation took over responsibility for the existing Prix mondial Cino Del Duca created by Madame Del Duca in 1969.
 The Foundation has been a substantial and important contributor to the arts in France and humanities worldwide. It has provided very significant support for scientific research, in particular for biomedical research and including oncology, biochemistry, and molecular genetics. The Foundation has funded a Fellowship for such things as a Postdoctoral for Studies in Neurobiology and funding for breast cancer research for organizations such as the Susan G. Komen for the Cure. As well, the ""Simone and Cino Del Duca Foundation on Cancer Pharmacotherapy"" paid for and published the 1983 book: Current Drugs And Methods of Cancer Treatment (Masson Pub.

 The Simone and Cino Del Duca Foundation provides two major arts prizes through the French Académie des Beaux-Arts. A prize in music is awarded annually plus one that is given on an alternating basis to painters and sculptors. In addition, the Foundation helped fund the major restoration of the collections of the Musée Condé at Chantilly, Oise.
 The Foundation also gives a prize in archaeology, intended to help with archaeology projects in France or abroad.
 Following the death of Madame Del Duca in 2004, administration of the Foundation has been assumed by the Institut de France"
Sir Dorabji Tata and Allied Trusts	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Dorabji_Tata_and_Allied_Trusts	"The Sir Dorabji Tata Trust was established by Sir Dorab Tata (fondly called Sir Dorabji), the elder son of Tata Group founder Jamsetji Tata. Founded in 1932, it is one of the oldest non-sectarian philanthropic organisations in India.
 Like his respected father, Sir Dorabji believed that one must make use of the wealth one had acquired for constructive purposes. So, in less than a year after his wife Meherbai's death, he donated all his wealth to the Trust, insisting that it must be used ""without any distinction of place, nationality or creed"", for the advancement of learning and research, the relief of distress and other charitable purposes. He died three months later.
 The wealth that he turned over to the Trust comprised his substantial share holdings in Tata Sons, Indian Hotels and allied companies, his landed properties and 21 pieces of jewellery left by his wife, including the famous Jubilee Diamond, estimated then to be of the value of Rs 10 million. Today, these would be worth more than Rs 500 million.
 As the Trust got formed and the trustees deliberated on the policy aspects and finalised them, it decided to adopt a broad framework—that it should undertake such projects, which are too large for individuals to handle and that each of these projects should have a genuine relevance to the welfare of the country. The Trust is mandated to:
 The Trust is best known for promoting and setting up pioneering institutions of national importance.
 Each of these institutions works in frontier areas of learning, research and knowledge dissemination. The ideas that have generated from these institutions and the people who have passed through their portals have enriched the various facets of India's development. Each of these institutions has produced a large number of social scientists, cancer specialists, nuclear scientists and distinguished institutional administrators who have all strived to make the country a power to reckon with in science and technology.
 In the last decade, the Trust has also given shape to the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore and helped the Dr MS Swaminathan Research Foundation to start the JRD Tata Centre for Ecotechnology in Chennai.
 In addition to these institutions, it has started with the assistance of the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind, Asia's first institute for the training of the rural blind, The Tata Agricultural and Rural Training Centre for the Blind, and with the cooperation of the United Nations, the International Institute of Demographic Studies.
 The Trust also helps various organisations and individuals with its grants. Its grants consist of Endowment Grants, grants to Non-Governmental Organisations and Small Grants, while Individual Grants are given to deserving individuals for medical, travel or educational purposes.
 What has helped the Trust in achieving its objectives has been the presence of distinguished personalities, most of them industry pioneers, on its board. Among them were JRD Tata, chairman of the Tata Group, Sir Ardeshir Dalal, Dr John Matthai and Sir Homi Mody.
 The involvement of JRD Tata in the affairs of Trust is not just incidental. Being a trustee since the Trust's inception, he held the position of chairman during the last 25 years of his life. His imprint is visible in the setting up of the Tata Memorial Hospital, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, National Institute of Advanced Studies and National Centre for the Performing Arts. His role was especially crucial in the establishment of the Tata Memorial Hospital. Right from its conceptual stages in early 1941, till it became a national centre for cancer research and treatment, JRD Tata was there all along to guide its destinies. In 1957, when the government of India's ministry of health temporarily took over the Tata Memorial Hospital, JRD Tata, along with Dr Homi Bhabha, the pioneer of India's nuclear energy programme, had the vision to foresee the role of radiation in cancer treatment and prevailed on the government to have the administrative control of the hospital transferred to the department of atomic energy in 1962.
 He had also put his own money and efforts to set up, in 1944, the multipurpose JRD Tata Trust. Many years later, he established the JRD and Thelma J Tata Trust, selling part of his shares and an apartment in Mumbai. The Trust works to improve the lot of India's disadvantaged women.
 What is typical of the Trust is that after establishing pioneering institutions, giving them shape and stabilising them, the Trust has handed over their day-to-day running to the Government of India. Thus, The Tata Memorial Hospital is now under the government, run by the department of atomic energy.
 The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research too has been handed over to the Atomic Energy Commission. Tata Institute of Fundamental Research today is a Deemed University.
 In the case of TISS and the TIFR, the chairmen of the boards have so far been the representatives of the Tata Trusts. The Trust is represented on the governing council of the Tata Memorial Hospital. However, the Trust still takes interest in these institutions and contributes its mite to their running.[1]
 As neither Sir Dorabji nor Sir Ratan had any children, their holdings could well have been fragmented and with them Tata Sons. The Trusts that Sir Dorabji and Sir Ratan set up gave to Tata Sons a cohesive and a continuing character over decades.
 The Trust sanctioned institutional grants, as well as grants to private individuals. The total disbursal made by the Trust in the fiscal year 2003 - 2004 was Rs 442.39 million."

Smile Train	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_Train	"Smile Train is a nonprofit organization and charity providing corrective surgery for children with cleft lips and palates.[1]
 Headquartered in New York City and founded in 1999, Smile Train provides free corrective cleft surgery in 87 countries,[2] training local doctors and providing hospital funding for the procedures.[2]
 According to Forbes magazine, Smile Train is the 72nd largest charity in America.[3]
 Smile Train was created in 1998 by Brian Mullaney and Charles Wang, who had previously worked with Operation Smile, another charity focused on correcting cleft lips and palates.[4] They felt the most efficient way to provide cleft surgery was to train and support local doctors rather than to fly in Western doctors to provide surgeries in poor, developing countries.[4][5] Local doctors would also be able to provide care year-round rather than the limited engagements of the ""mission-based"" model.[4][5]
 In 1999, Smile Train began providing corrective surgeries in China.[2] The charity worked with the then-American and Chinese presidents, George H.W. Bush and Jiang Zemin, in the planning of Smile Train's first operation in China.[6] As of 2013, the charity had provided approximately 300,000 corrective surgeries in partnership with 397 local hospitals within China.[2]
 Smile Train began working in India in 2000.[7] In 2011, Aishwarya Rai, a Bollywood actress and former Miss World, became Smile Train's first goodwill ambassador.[8] By 2013, Smile Train was conducting 50,000 corrective surgeries in India annually.[9]
 In 2006, Smile Train co-founded the Pan African Congress on Cleft Lip and Palate. The charity also funded the 2008 Pan African Anaesthesia Symposium.[10]
 In October 2010, Smile Train experienced a major leadership change which included the departure of Mullaney and other top executives.[11][12]
 Smile Train unveiled a new advertising campaign, ""The Power of a Smile"", in April 2014.[13] The campaign featured work from Kátia Lund and photojournalist Alex Webb, and coincided with the release of a new organizational logo.[13] That same month, Smile Train also held an event at the Barclays Center to celebrate its millionth cleft operation.[14]
 In early 2011, Smile Train and Operation Smile announced the two charities would merge,[15][16] followed three weeks later by announcements the merger had been aborted,[17] Smile Train having canceled the union.[18]  Smile Train's board also named Priscilla Ma the executive director of the organization, while other board members and directors stepped down.[19]
 In 2009, Smile Train initiated an advertising campaign[20] in the Richmond Times-Dispatch highlighting Smile Train's attempts between 2006 and 2009 to donate nearly $9 million to Operation Smile,[21] the organization Brian Mullaney had split from in 1998 in what Mullaney described as a ""messy divorce"".[22] In the ad, Mullaney contended Operation Smile was refusing money that could benefit children, later calling the situation ""shameful"";[21] Mullaney also noted that he respects that in some countries need overwhelms available doctors and he had ""a newfound respect for what Operation Smile does"".[22] The Virginian Pilot outlined the history and differences between the two organizations and indicated Mullaney wanted the two organizations to reconcile.[22] At the time, Dr. Magee of Operation Smile declined a newspaper interview, and Operation Smile formally responded to the ad campaign, saying the two organizations ""have different operating philosophies and business ethics"", and that Operation Smile would continue foregoing donations from an ""unproductive relationship"".[22]
 In 1999, Smile Train approached Dr. Court B. Cutting of New York University's Virtual Research Laboratory to create training videos, which could be used to train local doctors on how to perform advanced cleft surgery techniques.[23] The 3D models used in the videos were based on the CT scan of two Chinese patients.[24] Smile Train distributes the DVDs to local doctors worldwide.[5][23] The DVDs are available in English, Spanish, and Mandarin.[25]
 Smile Train later used the 3D models of the two Chinese patients to build the first 3D open access virtual surgical simulator, which teaches cleft palate and lip surgery to doctors in developing countries.[26] The simulator, which was created in partnership with BioDigital Systems, is web-based, open source and available for free.[26] It does not require any special hardware to use.[27] A mobile application is under development.[27] In September 2014, Smile Train showcased a 3D virtual surgery simulator at TEDMED 2014 in Washington, D.C.[28]
 Smile Train maintains Smile Train Express (STX), an internet-based, digital patient record database.[6][25] STX enables Smile Train to have outside medical experts review patient records and quality of care.[5][6] The charity also boasts a large medical research library with more than 1,000 articles related to clefts accessible online for free.[29]
 Smile Train helps the cause of cleft care through its funding of 1,000+ active partners representing nearly 1,200 hospitals and 2,300 partner surgeons in the world’s poorest nations; through these local partnerships, the organization is able to provide free surgery for children any day of the year, with more than one million total surgeries performed as of 2016.[30]
 In addition to partnerships with cleft care organizations, Smile Train has partnered with other individuals organizations in an effort to improve safety and quality at their partner hospitals, such as Dr. Atul Gawande, World Health Organization, World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists[31] and Lifebox.[32]
 Smile Train has a number of corporate partnerships, including Artisanal Cheese,[33] Dubai Duty Free,[34] Estée Lauder, FedEx,[35] QBE[36] The Queens Flowers,[37] Mars Retail Group [38] and Vertu.[39][40] These partnerships, in addition to those in partnership with donors on grassroots efforts, serve to both raise money and spread awareness.
 Current and former supporters include: Tatyana Ali,[41] John Bishop, Christie Brinkley,[42] Dean Cain,[43] Stephen Colbert, Kevin Connolly,[44] Walter Cronkite,[45] Erik Estrada,[46] Lucy Hale, Sammi Hanratty,[47] Rebecca Herbst,[48] Jane Kaczmarek,[49] Howie Mandel, Mary McCartney,[50] Reba McEntire,[51] Bette Midler, Jimmy Pardo,[52] General Colin Powell,[53] Aishwarya Rai Bachchan,[8] Carly Simon and Hilary Swank.[54]
 In a 2008 New York Times article, economist Steven Levitt of Freakonomics fame indicated that the organization's model and its technological innovations ""likely make Smile Train one of the most productive charities, dollar for deed, in the world.""[55]
 In 2008, Smile Train was the runner-up in the Health-Care IT category of the Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation Awards in recognition for their surgical technique training videos.[56] The Virtual Surgery Simulator was recognized in 2013 by the National Training Simulation Association (NTSA), a subsidiary of the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA), receiving an award in the ""training"" category.[57]
 In 2009, the documentary Smile Pinki, which was sponsored by Smile Train and directed by Megan Mylan, won the 2008 Oscar for Best Documentary (Short Subject).[58] The film shows the story of a poor girl in rural India whose life is transformed when she receives free surgery to correct her cleft lip. Free copies of the film are available through Smile Train's website.[59] In 2013, the documentary Dzachuka’s Smile, which was co-produced by China Central Television Documentary Channel (CCTV) and Smile Train, received the Gold Panda Award for Best Documentary in Society for Asian Production at the 2013 Sichuan TV Festival. The documentary follows the Lamu Sisters’ efforts to help children with clefts living on the Dzachuka Plateau.[60]
 In 2016, World Journal of Surgery published the comprehensive independent study ""Economic Valuation of the Global Burden of Cleft Disease Averted by a Large Cleft Charity"", which was conducted using data from 547,769 Smile Train patient records of primary cleft procedures (58 percent cleft lip repairs, 42 percent cleft palate repairs). The study measured the economic impact of cleft repair surgery over a ten-year period (2001–2011) and ""[quantified] the burden of disease averted through the global surgical work of a large cleft charity"". It concluded that for each $250 cleft repair surgery, as much as $50,000 is returned to the local economy as patients contribute to productivity. The total economic impact achieved as a result of their cleft repair surgeries in 83 countries between 2001 and 2011 amounts to as much as $27 billion.[61][62]
 In 2008, Charity Watch criticized then-president Brian Mullaney's $420,209 salary and questioned the 2007 company's tax form, which said Mullaney's salary came from temporary restricted funds designed to go toward overhead.[63]
 In 2009, Givewell could not assess the impact of Smile Train's activities based on the charity's 2008 tax form and other publicly accessible information.[64]
 Smile Train Canada's charity status was revoked on July 4, 2015 after 6 years of operation by Canada's Charities Directorate for failure to allocate donations towards charity purposes, failure to carry out its charity work, failure to file accurate information and other serious deficiencies.[65]
 The organizations key personnel are:[66]
 Smile Train complies with the 20 Standards for Charity Accountability established by the Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance.[68] The alliance was developed to ""assist donors in making sound giving decisions and to foster public confidence in charitable organizations"".[69]
 According to Smile Train's 2012 annual report, management and general expenses account for $1.9 million (1.2%) of total expenses.[70] $132.4 million (81.8%) went to program services and $27.6 million (17%) to fundraising.[70] Total support and revenue for 2012 was $175 million.[70]"
Societat de Beneficència de Naturals de Catalunya	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Societat_de_Benefic%C3%A8ncia_de_Naturals_de_Catalunya	"The Charitable Society of the Natives from Catalonia (Catalan: Societat de Beneficència de Naturals de Catalunya), also known as the Casal Català or the Beneficencia Catalana,[2] is a charity founded by Catalan immigrants in Havana, Cuba, in 1840.[3][4]
 The society was founded by a group of 102 emigrants from Catalonia, led by Antoni Font and Josep Gener,[3][5] in order to assist poor  Catalan immigrants that found themselves stranded in the Cuban capital. The association began increasing its membership following the independence of Cuba in 1900. Members of the organization included José Murillo and Joaquim Muntal, who was vice-president of the society from 1925 to 1928.
 The society's main activity is providing economic support to the members. Over time, however, the organization has expanded its mission to include the organization of cultural and festive activities relevant to Catalonians. With more than 1,400 partners, they promote various activities related to Catalonia, including habaneres, the celebration of Sant Jordi, esbart dansaire, puntaires, poetry readings, concerts and film screenings.[1] [5]
 Another objective of the charitable society is the maintenance of the Monserrate hermitage, located near the Havana airport. The hermitage is a replica of the S'Agaró church and houses a replica of the Virgin of Montserrat.[5]
 With over 170 years of history, the association has a legacy of documenting the economic and social conditions of Catalan emigrants, and has received awards from the Institute of Catalan Studies, the Generality of Catalonia and the Cross of St.George 1993.[6]"
Society of Saint Vincent de Paul	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Saint_Vincent_de_Paul	"The Society of St Vincent de Paul (SVP or SVdP or SSVP) is an international voluntary organization in the Catholic Church, founded in 1833 for the sanctification of its members by personal service of the poor.
 Innumerable Catholic parishes have established ""conferences"", most of which affiliate with a diocesan council. Among its varied efforts to offer material help to the poor or needy, the Society also has thrift stores which sell donated goods at a low price and raise money for the poor.[5] There are a great variety of outreach programs sponsored by the local conferences and councils, addressing local needs for social services.[1]
 The Society of St. Vincent de Paul was founded in 1833 to help impoverished people living in the slums of Paris, France.[6] The primary figure behind the Society's founding was Blessed Frédéric Ozanam, a French lawyer, author, and professor in the Sorbonne.  Frédéric collaborated with Emmanuel Bailly, editor of the Tribune Catholique, in reviving a student organization which had been suspended during the revolutionary activity of July 1830. Ozanam was 20 years old when he founded the Society.[7] He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1997.[8] Emmanuel Bailly was chosen as the first President.
 The Society took Saint Vincent de Paul as its patron under the influence of Sister Rosalie Rendu, DC.  Sister Rosalie, beatified in November 1999 by Pope John Paul II, was a member of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, earlier known for her work with people in the slums of Paris. She guided Frédéric and his companions in their approach towards those in need.[9]
 SVP gradually expanded outside Paris in the mid-19th century and received benefactors in places such as Tours where figures such as the Venerable Leo Dupont, known as the Holy Man of Tours, became collaborators.[10]
 The Society is part of the Vincentian Family which also includes two congregations founded by St. Vincent de Paul – the Congregation of the Mission with Vincentian priests and brothers and the Ladies of Charity – along with the Sisters of Charity in the Setonian tradition and several others, including some religious groups that are part of the Anglican Communion like the Company of Mission Priests.[9][1]
 Servant of God Fr. Ignatius Spencer from London came to know the Society in visits to Paris. Parisian Monsieur Baudon, who would assume the presidency of SVDP in 1847, visited London in 1842 and persuaded Spencer to write about the Society in the Catholic Magazine. Then in January 1844 M. Pagliano, a London restaurateur and recent convert to Catholicism, gathered 13 Catholic men and the first English SVP conference was founded.[11] Early initiatives included the formation of the Catholic Shoe Black Brigade, providing boys with gainful employment and the first home of “the Rescue Society” which under various names still offers child care in many dioceses.[12]
 In 2013 there were more than 10,000 members in more than 1,000 Conferences in the United Kingdom, making over 500,000 recorded visits annually to more than 100,000 people.[12]
 The Society’s first Conference in the United States was established in 1845 in St. Louis, Missouri, at the Basilica of St. Louis King of France, or ""Old Cathedral"". Fr. John Timon, CM, had learned of the Society while visiting with his Vincentian superiors in Paris. From Dublin, Ireland, he brought to St. Louis copies of the SVP Rule. On November 16, 1845, Bishop Peter Richard Kenrick dedicated the new St. Vincent de Paul church on South Eighth Street and invited Timon to preach. Timon discussed the Society in his sermon,[13] in the presence of prominent laymen who took hold of the idea and held an organizational meeting on November 20, 1845. The Conference included Dr. Moses Linton, founder of the St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal, and as chair Judge Bryan Mullanphy who would become mayor of St. Louis.[14][15] Bishop Kenrick appointed Fr. Ambrose Heim as spiritual advisor to the Conference.[16]
 Father Gerald Ward was born in London in 1806 and was recruited for the Melbourne mission by the pioneering father, later bishop, Patrick Geoghegan. Ward was familiar with SVP from London and, observing the plight of the poor after the Victorian gold rush, established the Society in Australia in 1854. Ward served as its first president and helped establish the SVP orphanage in South Melbourne.[17] Charles O'Neill, an engineer and parliamentarian who had led the Society in Scotland, established it in Sydney.
 Fr. Chataigner, SM, established the first Conference in New Zealand in July 1867, but did not affiliate with the Council-General in Paris. The first to affiliate was the Wellington Conference founded in 1908 by Fr. Petitjean, SM, and Charles O'Neill, followed by other Conferences out of Wellington.[18][19]
 Charles Gordon O'Neill was born in Glasgow in 1828. He graduated as a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Upon graduation he had joined the Society of St Vincent de Paul. He was secretary at Dumbarton in 1851. He led the St Vincent de Paul Society in the Western Districts of Scotland between 1859 and 1863.  By 1863 he was president of the Superior Council of Glasgow and a member of the Council-General in Paris.[20]
 SVP came to Mumbai in 1862 when the Conference of Our Lady of Hope, Bhuleshwar, was established at the cathedral by the future bishop Fr. Leo Meurin, S.J. With the closure of the cathedral in 1942, the Conference was transferred to the Church of Our Lady of Health, Cavel. Meurin also established a Conference at St. Teresa, Girgaum, in 1862, and four more in Mumbai in 1863: St. Peter, Bandra; St. Joseph, Umarkhadi; Our Lady of Victories, Mahim; and St. Anne, Mazagaon.[21] The Society is active in southern India, headquartered in Kerala.
 The Society numbers about 800,000 members in some 140 countries worldwide, whose members operate through ""conferences"".[4] A Conference may be based out of a church, school, community center, hospital, etc., and is composed of Catholic volunteers who pursue their own Christian growth in the service of the poor. Some Conferences exist without affiliating with any local Council, and so are not counted in statistics. Non-Catholics may join and the Society serves all regardless of their personal beliefs.[4]
 The Society of St. Vincent de Paul was founded in Ireland in 1844 when it was part of the United Kingdom but was only a thing in ireland at that point until it spread worldwide. It is the largest voluntary charitable organisation in Ireland.  During its history it has helped people in need through a famine, a civil war, a war of independence, two world wars, and several economic recessions. It is one of Ireland's best known and most widely supported organisations of social concern and action with over 11,500 volunteers, active in every county in Ireland.[22]
 In Australia the ""Vinnies"" number about 58,000.[23] Works include Conferences, Special Works, and Vinnies shops,[24] assisting over 2,200,000 people in Australia each year.[25]
 In 2018, the St Vincent de Paul Society Queensland was named as one of the Queensland Greats by Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in a ceremony at the Queensland Art Gallery on 8 June 2018.[26]
 In New Zealand, SVP operates in 23 regions with over 50 shops which serve as centres for welfare service, including food banks and food trucks. Most Catholic schools have Young Vinnies who help with fundraising and with training for dealing directly with the poor. The work is varied, following the Vinnie motto: ""No act of charity is foreign to the society.""[27]
 The national headquarters is in St. Louis. Membership in the United States in 2015 exceeded 97,000 in 4,400 communities.  Expenditures to people in poverty were $473,821,563. Programs include visits to homes, prisons, and hospitals, housing assistance, disaster relief, job training and placement, food pantries, dining halls, clothing, transportation and utility costs, care for the elderly, and medicine.[28] Revenue is raised through a large network of thrift stores.[29]
 The first Conference of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul in Monaco was created in 1876. 
The Conference of the immaculate Conception of Monaco-City whose commemorative plaque is on the Place de la Visitation, thanks among others to Monsieur Thheuret, Apostolic Protonotary in Monaco and to Mr Gastaldi, Mayor of Monaco. Mr. Theuret was appointed first Honorary President. The Vice-President of Honor being the Marquis de la Riva, first Chambellan of the Sovereign Prince.
 The first active President was Lieutenant Plati. The Sovereign Prince, Prince Charles III, was one of the first benefactors. At the time, the Immaculate Conception Conference was attached to the Particular Council of the Nice Conferences.

Somaly Mam	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somaly_Mam	"Somaly Mam (Khmer: ម៉ម សុម៉ាលី /mɑːm sɔmaliː/[4] also spelt ម៉ម សូម៉ាលី) (born 1970 or 1971) is a Cambodian anti-trafficking advocate who focuses primarily on sex trafficking.[5]  From 1996 to 2014, Mam was involved in campaigns against sex trafficking.  She set up the Somaly Mam Foundation, raised money, appeared on major television programs, and spoke at many international events.
 After allegations of lying had appeared in The Cambodia Daily in 2012 and 2013, Newsweek ran a cover-story in May 2014 claiming that Mam had fabricated stories of abuse about herself and others. After the Somaly Mam Foundation undertook its own investigation by Goodwin Procter, a Boston-based law firm, she resigned from her position and the foundation shut down in October 2014.[6][7][3] She moved back to live in Cambodia before returning to the US later that year to begin new fund-raising activities.
 Mam was born to a tribal minority family in Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia. In her memoir, The Road of Lost Innocence, she states that she was born in either 1970 or 1971.[1]:2[1]
 Mam was investigated by a journalist working in Cambodia, and his allegations that key parts of her early life were false was carried by Newsweek in May 2014.[8] Mam resigned from the Somaly Mam Foundation shortly thereafter.[3] An investigation by Marie Claire magazine came to a different conclusion, finding witnesses that supported Mam's story and contradicted Newsweek's allegations.[5]
 In her book Mam said she attended school in Cambodia, but did not graduate. According to the Newsweek article, Mam did graduate and found two students and a teacher to support their claims,[8] but Marie Claire quotes the school director remembering she attended only three years of school.
 Mam said that she was abused by her ""grandfather"" until she was approximately 14 and that she was sold to a brothel and forced into prostitution and that she was also forced to marry a stranger.[3][8][9] She has claimed that she was forced to prostitute herself on the streets and made to have sex with five or six clients per day.[1]:42–45[10][11]
 Mam left Cambodia for Paris, France, in 1993 where she married a French citizen, Pierre Legros.  They divorced in 2008.[2][3]
 Mam served as an untrained healthcare worker[12][13] with Médecins Sans Frontières and, in her spare time, handed out condoms, soap, and information to women in the brothels. In 1996, she co-founded AFESIP (Agir pour les Femmes en Situation Precaire or ""Acting for Women in Distressing Situations""), a Cambodian NGO dedicated to rescuing, housing and rehabilitating women and children in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam who have been sexually exploited.[14] AFESIP conducts outreach work to try helping the women still enslaved. The organization also works with law enforcement to raid the brothels.[15] The company has locations in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.[14]
 In June 2007, Mam co-founded the Somaly Mam Foundation, a nonprofit organization formed in the United States that supported anti-trafficking groups and helped women and girls who had been forced into sexual slavery. The Somaly Mam Foundation (SMF) attracted the support of U.S. business leaders and Hollywood stars. SMF was the global fundraising arm of Somaly Mam's Phnom Penh-based AFESIP.[16]
 After the May 2014 Newsweek article questioning Mam's claims, the Somaly Mam Foundation undertook its own investigation by Goodwin Procter, a Boston-based law firm. Mam resigned from her position and later the foundation shut down in October 2014.[6][7][3][17] In January 2015, Mam and former operations director of SMF Rigmor Schneider[18] launched a New Somaly Mam Fund as a funding source for AFESIP.[19] In 2016, a new charity, Together1heart, became the primary fundraising vehicle for AFESIP.[20] Actress AnnaLynne McCord serves as CEO of Together1Heart.[21] Posts on the group's Facebook page suggest that Mam is still heavily involved, and McCord insists that Mam is a ""survivor"" and appears to absolve her of wrongdoing, while stating that neither Together1heart nor AFESIP has made changes as a result of the 2014 public relations crisis.[20]
 Scrutiny of Mam's story began with comments she made at the United Nations. Speaking on a United Nations panel to member states, international aid organizations and the media in New York on April 3, Mam stated that eight girls had been killed after her organization AFESIP conducted a high-profile raid on a massage parlor at the Chai Hour II Hotel in Phnom Penh, where 83 women and girls were taken and placed in her refuge center. Somaly Mam has since admitted that this was ""inaccurate"" and that the Cambodian army had not killed eight girls.
 On 25 April 2012, the Cambodia Daily newspaper reported Mam's ex-husband and one-time AFESIP director Pierre Legros, saying that Mam had misrepresented an incident involving their daughter in 2004.[22] Mam had long claimed that the teenager was kidnapped and raped by human traffickers in retaliation for her raid on the Chai Hour II Hotel.[15] In her 2007 autobiography, Mam wrote that the people involved in the kidnapping of her daughter were released from jail, though a trial was pending. Legros said their daughter was not kidnapped, but had run away with her boyfriend, and that in his view the abduction story was a means of ""marketing for the Somaly Mam Foundation"". The U.S. Ambassador at the time, Joseph Mussomeli, wrote in a diplomatic cable in 2004 that Mam claimed that Mam's daughter had been ""lured by her peers"" to Battambang Province and that she was later found in a night club there in the company of three men who were arrested and charged with trafficking. Cambodian officials told the newspaper they had no record of such events.[23]
 In October 2013, the Cambodia Daily alleged a further deception took place in January 1998, when Mam was propelled into the international media spotlight largely owing to the on-camera testimony of the young Meas Ratha and other alleged victims of Cambodia's child sex industry. Mam's work as president of AFESIP was being featured on French television as part of the popular weekly show Envoyé spécial. Ratha, then a teenager of about 14 years from Takeo province, told a story of sexual slavery in an unspecified brothel somewhere in Phnom Penh. Sixteen years later, Ratha (now 32 years old and married) told the newspaper that her testimony for the France 2 channel was fabricated and scripted for her by Mam as a means of drumming up support for the organization. Ratha said, ""The video that you see, everything that I put in is not my story.""[24]
 On 1 June 2015 the Phnom Penh Post, in an article based on recently released State Department cables, revealed that the United States government ""...knew about the now-infamous deceptions and malpractice within organisations run by Somaly Mam for years prior to the media exposés"". The article cites a cable titled Somaly Mam Under Microscope sent to the State Department from the US embassy in Phnom Penh on May 8, 2012. Speaking of Mam's claim that her daughter was abducted in 2006 in revenge for an Afesip raid on a Phnom Penh brothel in 2004, the cable says: “Ms Mam has made this claim on numerous occasions despite having reported to post [the embassy] at the time of the incident that the girl was not kidnapped but rather lured by her peers from Phnom Penh to Battambang”. The embassy cable quoted sources in the anti-trafficking community in Phnom Penh as saying that Mam was “rotten to the core,” but as having made a “strategic decision to remain silent on concerns about Afesip’s accounting systems and general lack of financial controls to avoid putting … other anti-[trafficking] NGOs ‘at risk’”.[25]
 On May 28, 2014, after the Newsweek exposé, and receiving the report from lawyers, Mam resigned from the Somaly Mam Foundation.[26] In late 2014, Mam returned to New York, hoping to restore her reputation and launched a public relations campaign, hiring publicity firm Jonathan Marder & Company.[27][28] Mam protested her innocence in a September 2014 interview in Marie Claire, and launched the New Somaly Mam Fund soon after.[5][27][28]
 In October 2014 the Cambodian government announced that Mam would be prohibited from operating an NGO, but days later appeared to withdraw the prohibition. By December 2014 she was accepting donations for a new NGO with headquarters in Texas, ""The New Somaly Mam Fund: Voices for Change"". As was the case with her previous venture, US actress Susan Sarandon was recruited to serve on the board of the charity.[29] ""I hope that chapter is closed. I am very comfortable that what she is saying is the truth. The new organization will not rescue women and girls but collaborate with other NGOs to rehabilitate and educate them once they are free so they can find jobs"", the co-founder of the 'fund', Rigmor Schneider told a reporter, and explained plans to operate two residential centres. ""Basically what we're looking for now is funding.""[30]
 On October 9, 2014, in an interview in Global Post, Mam's ex-husband and co-founder of AFESIP Pierre Legros expressed disinterest in Mam's deceptions: ""When you work in this world, you know fabricated stories are used by everyone to get funding."" He was more concerned about ""mismanagement and sexual abuse allegations within a shelter in 2006."" He said that he wished ""to denounce the logic of a failing system praising 'development'.""[31]

SOS Children's Villages	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS_Children%27s_Villages	"SOS[SAVE OUR SOUL] Children's Villages is the largest independent, non-governmental, nonprofit international development organization headquartered in Innsbruck, Austria. The organization provides humanitarian and developmental assistance to children in need and protects their interests and rights around the world.[1][2][3][4] The first SOS Children's Village was founded in 1949 in Tyrol, Austria by an Austrian philanthropist Hermann Gmeiner.[5] Today, SOS Children's Villages is active in 135 countries and territories worldwide[6][7]
 SOS Children's Villages provide alternative families to children without adequate parental care.[8] Children of different ages and background live together in a house with a full-time parent, usually a woman who serves as the children's parent.[9][10][11] There are usually 6 to 15 houses in a typical SOS Village. In addition to the Villages, the organization also runs a whole range of programs and facilities to support socially disadvantaged and impoverished families through its subsidized kindergartens, primary and secondary schools,[12] youth facilities[13][14][15] social and medical centers, and emergency response relief operations[16]
.[17][18] In 2017, over 85,000 children and youths are raised in 572 SOS Children's Villages and over 700 SOS Youth Facilities. Another 3.8 million children and adults received services from their other programs.[19]
 SOS relies on contributions from governments and private donors. In 2017, the organization's 350 institutional partnership contracts totaled more than €31 million in institutional funds implemented. Funding from foundations and lotteries totaled nearly €48 million, and corporate partnerships provided more than €49 million in support for SOS Children's Villages globally.[20] The organization was awarded the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize[21] in 2002, and the Princess of Asturias Award of Concord in 2016.[22]
 The Second World War resulted in many children becoming homeless and orphaned. Hermann Gmeiner (23 June 1919 – 26 April 1986), who himself participated in the war as an Austrian soldier, founded the first SOS Children's Village in Imst in the Austrian Federal State of Tyrol in 1949.[23] Originally, the SOS Children's Village was established to look after the orphans of the Second World War. But later the organization eventually started looking after other children such as the abandoned, neglected, abused, and children in difficult economic circumstances.[24]
 In the second half of the 20th century, the organization spread all over Europe. In 1959, SOS Children's Village national associations were established in Italy, France, and Germany, and in the same year, the first SOS Youth Facility was founded in Innsbruck, Austria. As the organization grew, the umbrella organization SOS-Kinderdorf International was established to oversee all the national associations in the world in 1960. In the same year, the first SOS Children's Village in South America was founded in Uruguay. In 1963, the organization reached Asia with the first Villages established in North Korea and India. Seven years later, the organization founded Villages in Africa in the Republic of Ivory Coast, Kenya, Ghana, and Sierra Leone.[25] In North America, the first Village was established in 1991 in the United States. Today, there are now more than 570 SOS Children's Villages present in 135 countries and territories.[26]
 Hermann Gmeiner was the SOS Children's Village president until 1985 when he was succeeded by Helmut Kutin. Helmut Kutin, born in 1941 in Bolzano, Italy, who was one of the first children admitted in SOS Austria, led the organization SOS Children's Villages International for 27 years after which in 2012 he was succeeded by the current president Siddhartha Kaul, born in 1951 in Pilana, India[27][28]
 Each 118 national SOS Children's Villages associations carries out the international organizations’ missions, protocols, and policies. Regional offices guide this work and provide fundraising, marketing, and technical assistance to country offices as needed. Overall management and administration of the organization takes place at the headquarter in Innsbruck, Austria. The highest decision-making body is the General Assembly responsible for electing the President, Vice-President, and other members of the international senate. Guiding and monitoring of all SOS’ work is the responsibility of the International Senate made up of 22 members. They establish policies, formulate policy changes, and procedural guidelines. The International Senate's work is coordinated by the Management Council, comprising eight representatives from member associations chaired by the President. The Management Council makes recommendations for Senate decisions, approves work plans developed by the Management Team, and defines the federation's targets. The General Secretariat comprises the international offices in Austria, and other regional offices responsible for implementing strategic decisions, developing and monitoring the organization's quality standards, and representing the organization in international communications and forums SOS Children's Villages Governance.
 The organization follows three international frameworks that serve as guidelines for their work. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) adopted in 1989 is a human rights treaty that sets out the civil, political, economic, social, health, and cultural rights of children. The UN Guidelines for Alternative Care of Children adopted in 2009 provides a framework for governments to acknowledge and deliver alternative care to children in need.[29] And the UN Sustainable Development Goal adopted in 2015 and valid until 2030 in which SOS' work focuses mainly on vulnerable children and families.
 In 2017, the organization launched the No Child Should Grow Up Alone campaign which aims to emphasize research showing that 1 in 10 children (220 million) worldwide is growing up alone. The campaign is based on a global research called the 'Care Effect' claiming that children growing up without adequate parental care are particularly vulnerable to different forms of human rights violations such as child labor, violence, and sex trafficking.[30]
 
The report concluded that: ""If we provide care for today’s children in vulnerable circumstances, giving them the foundation they need for learning and developing life skills, we stand a better chance of building a better future for the world”[31] In 2012, the organization launched the Care For ME! Campaign to encourage research and assessment on alternative child care and to advocate the need to protect the human rights of children from various violations committed against them. Participating countries need to assess whether their national alternative care system complies with the UN Guidelines for Alternative Care of Children.[32]
 In 2009, the organization launched the ""I Matter"" campaign to improve legislation surrounding the practice on leaving care. The aim is to support youth ageing out of care in their transition toward independence.[33]
 SOS is present in over 135 countries around the world. These are listed below by region. SOS organizations in these countries provide active support to children and families. Exceptions are countries marked with an asterisk, in which SOS maintains representative offices which focus on fundraising and building awareness.[34]
 In January 2018, the branch of the association in Ethiopia was accused of supporting Islam, including forcible conversion of children.[40] The organization denies the allegations, but does admit that a mosque (now closed) had been built on SOS land, contrary to policy.[41]
 The first prominent supporter was the German-British businesswoman Béatrice von Boch-Galhau, wife of the largest shareholder of the ceramic manufacturer Villeroy & Boch.
She became friends with the at-the-time unknown Hermann Gmeiner. In 1959, she employed some of her private fortune to pay for the first Kinderdorf in Germany located in Merzig Hilbringen. She also used her husband's political connections to promote the SOS Kinderdorf idea which was first meeting resistance from the local majors.
 Prominent supporters include Nelson Mandela; the Dalai Lama; international footballers Kakha Kaladze, Andriy Shevchenko, Vincent Kompany, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Cesc Fàbregas and Javier Zanetti; opera singer Anna Netrebko; writer Henning Mankell; Belgian tennis player Kim Clijsters; French writer & actress Anny Dupérey; Sarah, Duchess of York; English Child Actress Georgie Henley; former model Princess Salimah Aga Khan; actress and singer Cher; businessman and television host Mike Holmes; Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter and entertainer June Carter Cash; and Johnny Cash whose memorial fund is towards the work of SOS Children's Villages worldwide.[citation needed] The organisation received the 2002 Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize.[42]
 SOS also receive significant funds through Genworth Financial's Putts4Charity initiative, which they run on golf's European Tour. In November 2012, the initiative reached €1 million in total money raised since 2007."

The Dalai Lama supports SOS Children, particularly the SOS Children's Villages in North India, which provide a home for child refugees from Tibet.
 In 2005 SOS Children's Villages UK founded World Orphan Week (WOW), a campaign which runs annually. The project aims to raise awareness about the large number of children missing one or both parents around the world. The campaign works with schools, universities, individuals, companies, and community groups to hold events on a local and national scale to raise awareness and funds for the organisation. 
 In 2018 World Orphan Week will be held on 3-10 February.
 In 2011 SOS Children's Villages UK created a new web site ""Our Africa""[8] which won the New Media category of the One World Media Awards.[9] Our Africa is an educational site with many short videos and articles created to celebrate 40 years of SOS Children's Villages work in Africa. Many of the videos are devised and filmed by children across Africa.
 Since 2006, SOS Children's Villages UK has produced a offline selection from Wikipedia, based around the UK national curriculum and targeted at a school-age audience. The project was initially aimed at schools in the developing world, where internet access is often limited, but has also proved popular in developed countries as well. This is partly because all content is checked to ensure suitability for children and relevance to the classroom, making it safe for use in schools. As well as being an offline resource available on request, it is also available online. It was last updated in 2013.
 Current trustees are Mary Cockcroft (Chairman), George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews, Michael Brewer, Graham Budd, Ayesha Khan, Matthew de Villiers, and Thomas Bauer."

St. Baldrick's Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Baldrick%27s_Foundation	"The St. Baldrick's Foundation is a not-for-profit organization with the aim of raising funds to help find cures for children with cancer. The name of the foundation is not associated with a recognized Saint of the Catholic Church, but is founded on word play and appropriation of the title of sainthood. Volunteers sponsored by family, friends, and employers shave their heads or ""chop"" their ponytails in solidarity with children who typically lose their hair during cancer treatment in order to raise funds.[1]
 Tim Kenny, John Bender, and Enda McDonnell founded the St. Baldrick's Foundation on July 4, 1999 as a challenge to see how they would give back for their ""good fortune in business"".[2] The inaugural event was hosted on March 17, 2000 at Jim Prady's Pub in Manhattan, where $104,000 was raised by 19 shavees.[3] The foundation officially registered as a 501(c)(3) charitable non-profit in 2004.[4]  During their first year as an official foundation, they managed to raise over $5.3 million for the Children's Oncology Group.[2] On January 9 and 10, St. Baldrick's hosted their inaugural Research Priorities Summit in New York City. Foundation board members and executives were in attendance, alongside 16 pediatric oncology researchers.[5] According to their official website, 2012 marked $100 million given in childhood cancer research grants since their first year as an independent foundation in 2005.[2]
 
All events are hosted by volunteers in the community, with the foundation providing planning tools and support.[6] Volunteers can find events near them and help set up the event space, shave heads, have their heads shaved, or any combination of the three. Events have taken place in all 50 US states and 28 countries. Since 2000, St. Baldricks event organizers and volunteers have hosted nearly 4,200 head-shaving events and shaved over 190,500 heads, raising over $118 million for life-saving childhood cancer research.[2] After a volunteer reaches a certain number of repeat years, the foundation awards them through ""knighting ceremonies"". According to Plenty Consulting, 2,600 volunteers had thus far earned the Knight of the Bald Table award in 2015, which is given for seven years of service to the organization.[7] The Charity Navigator gave the foundation a 76.99 out of a possible 100 score rating (March 15, 2018) and only One Star in Financial Score out of a possible 4 Star rating.[8] According to Better Business Bureau, the non-profit meets the 20 Standards for Charity Accountability.[9]"
St. Jude Children's Research Hospital	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jude_Children%27s_Research_Hospital	"St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, founded in 1962, is a pediatric treatment and research facility focused on children's catastrophic diseases, particularly leukemia and other cancers. The hospital costs about $2.8 million a day to run, and there is no cost to the patient to be treated.[1] It is located in Memphis, Tennessee, and is a nonprofit medical corporation designated as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization by the Internal Revenue Service.[2]
 St. Jude was founded by entertainer Danny Thomas in 1962, with help from Lemuel Diggs and Thomas' close friend from Miami, automobile dealer Anthony Abraham. The hospital was founded on the premise that ""no child should die in the dawn of life"".[3] This idea resulted from a promise that Thomas, a Maronite Catholic, had made to a saint years before the hospital was founded. Thomas was a comedian who was struggling to get a break in his career and living paycheck to paycheck. When his first child was about to be born, he attended Mass in Detroit and put his last $7.00 in the offering bin. He prayed to St. Jude Thaddeus for a means to provide for his family, and about a week later, he obtained a gig that paid 10 times what he had put in the offering bin. After that time, Thomas believed in the power of prayer.  He promised St. Jude Thaddeus that if the saint made him successful, he would one day build him a shrine. Years later, Thomas became an extremely successful comedian and built St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as a shrine to St. Jude Thaddeus to honor his promise.[4]
 In 1957, Thomas, a Lebanese-American, founded the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC), which helped him realize his dream. ALSAC is also the fundraising organization of St. Jude. Since St. Jude opened its doors in 1962, ALSAC has had the responsibility of raising the necessary funds to keep the hospital open.  Memphis was chosen at the suggestion of Roman Catholic Cardinal Samuel Stritch, a Tennessee native who had been a spiritual advisor to Thomas since he presided at Thomas's confirmation in Thomas's boyhood home of Toledo, Ohio.[5][6]
 Although it was named after Thomas's patron saint, St. Jude is not a Catholic hospital and is not affiliated with any religious organization.[7]
 In late 2007, the Chili's Care Center opened on the St. Jude campus. Chili's restaurant chain has pledged to provide $50 million to fund the construction of the center. The seven-story Chili's Care Center will have a floor area of 340,000 square feet (32,000 m2) and will add 24 labs and 16 beds to the campus. It will house the department of radiological services, The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, two floors of outpatient clinics, one floor of inpatient clinics and rooms, two floors of laboratory space, an office floor and an unfinished level for future expansion.
 In June 2008, Sterling Jewelers and St. Jude officially opened the new Kay Kafe (named after one of Sterling's jewelry chains), featuring a spacious lounge area, a significantly larger dining area and a variety of new dining options. More than ever, the cafeteria is the focal point of the campus where families and staff can escape and relax away from the treatment areas. The grand opening ceremony featured Marlo Thomas, national outreach director for St. Jude; Tony Thomas, member of the ALSAC/St. Jude Boards of Directors and Governors; Terry Burman, chairman of Sterling; Mark Light, CEO and president of Sterling; John P. Moses, CEO of ALSAC, the fundraising organization for St. Jude; Dr. William E. Evans, CEO of St. Jude; Joyce Aboussie, chair of the ALSAC Board of Directors, and Robert Breit, chair of the St. Jude Board of Governors.[8]
 In 2014, the Marlo Thomas Center for Global Education and Collaboration was opened as part of the hospital.[9] In 2017, the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences accepted its inaugural class of PhD students.
 Discoveries at St. Jude have profoundly changed how doctors treat children with cancer and other catastrophic illnesses.[10][11] Since St. Jude was established, the survival rate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common type of childhood cancer, has increased from 4 percent in 1962 to 94 percent today.[11] During this time, the overall survival rate for childhood cancers has risen from 20 percent to 80 percent.[12] St. Jude has treated children from across the United States and from more than 70 countries. Doctors across the world consult with St. Jude on their toughest cases.[13] Also, St. Jude has an International Outreach Program to improve the survival rates of children with catastrophic illnesses worldwide through the transfer of knowledge, technology and organizational skills.[14]
 Donald Pinkel was the first director of St. Jude and served from 1962 until 1973. His successor, Alvin Mauer, was director from 1973 to 1983. Joseph Simone was the hospital's third director from 1983 to 1992. Arthur W. Nienhuis was CEO and director of St. Jude from 1993 until 2004. William E. Evans, the hospital's fifth director, served from 2004 to 2014. He was succeeded by current CEO and director James R. Downing on July 15, 2014.
 As of 2018[update], St. Jude's scientific director was James I. Morgan, Ph.D.[15]
 St. Jude's board of directors is chaired by Camille F. Sarrouf Jr. and includes Joyce Aboussie, Ruth Gaviria and Tony Thomas (producer).
 St. Jude and over 46 of its staff members have been the recipients of numerous exemplary awards and achievements. For example, in 2010 St. Jude Children's Research Hospital was named the number one children's cancer hospital in the U.S by U.S. News & World Report.[16] It has also been named one of the top 10 companies to work for in academia by The Scientist for 7 successive years.[17] Most notably, Peter C. Doherty, Ph.D., of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital was co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for work related to how the immune system kills virus-infected cells.
 St. Jude is associated with several affiliated hospitals in the United States to further its efforts beyond its own physical walls. The hospital uses its Domestic Affiliates Program to form this partnership with the other pediatric programs. This program is a network of hematology clinics, hospitals, and universities that are united under the mission of St. Jude.
 These sites are used as a means of referring eligible patients to St. Jude as well as a location to administer some care. Through the Domestic Affiliates Program staff at St. Jude work together and collaborate with those at the other institutions. Affiliated sites are expected to comply with standards set by St. Jude and are audited to ensure proper and quality care.[18]
 Currently the Domestic Affiliate Clinic sites include:
 St. Jude also works closely with Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center, also located in downtown Memphis.  St. Jude patients needing certain procedures, such as brain surgery, may undergo procedures at LeBonheur Hospital.  Both St. Jude and Le Bonheur are teaching hospitals affiliated with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. University of Tennessee physicians training in pediatrics, surgery, radiology, and other specialties undergo service rotations at St. Jude Hospital.
 The Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon was established in Beirut on April 12, 2002. The center is an affiliate of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and works in association with the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC).[20]
 A commitment has been made to establish a US$412 million research facility in Memphis, Tennessee, one purpose of which will be to serve as a collaborative hub.[15]
 Funding for St. Jude comes from many sources, including government grants and insurance recoveries, but the principal source of funding (64% average over the past seven years) is from the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC) - a semi-independent entity that raises funds using the name of St. Jude.[21] Of a dollar donated to the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, about $0.52  makes its way through to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (averaged over seven years).[21]
 All medically eligible patients who are accepted for treatment at St. Jude are treated without regard to the family's ability to pay. St. Jude is one of a few pediatric research organizations in the United States where families never pay for treatments that are not covered by insurance, and families without insurance are never asked to pay. In addition to providing medical services to eligible patients, St. Jude also assists families with transportation, lodging, and meals. Three separate specially-designed patient housing facilities— Tri Delta Place for short-term (up to one week), Ronald McDonald House for medium-term (one week to 3 months), and Target House for long-term (3 months or more)—provide housing for patients and up to three family members, with no cost to the patient. These policies, along with research expenses and other costs, cause the hospital to incur more than $2.4 million in operating costs each day.[22]
 From 2000 to 2005, 83.7% of every dollar received by St. Jude went to the current or future needs of St. Jude. In 2002 to 2004, 47% of program expenses went to patient care and 41% to research.[23] As of 2012, 81 cents of every dollar donated to St. Jude goes directly to its research and treatment.[12]
 To cover operating costs, ALSAC conducts many fund-raising events and activities. The FedEx St. Jude Classic, a PGA Tour event, is one of the most visible fund-raising events for the hospital. Other fund-raising programs include the St. Jude Math-A-Thon, Up 'til Dawn, direct mailings, radiothons and television marketing.
 St. Jude also has a merchandise catalog called the Hope Catalog. The catalog contains everything from shirts to office items, and from patient art to ""Give Thanks"" wristbands.
 In November 2004, St. Jude launched its inaugural Thanks and Giving campaign which encourages consumers to help raise funds at participating retailers by adding a donation at checkout or by purchasing specialty items to benefit St. Jude. The campaign is supported by network television spots, advertisements in major publications, interactive marketing on Yahoo! and a movie trailer that runs on 20,000 screens nationwide, runs from Thanksgiving until the New Year. The campaign was created by St. Jude National Outreach Director Marlo Thomas and her siblings Terre Thomas and Tony Thomas, children of hospital founder Danny Thomas. Customers nationwide are asked to help raise funds at participating retailers by adding a donation at check out or by purchasing specialty items to benefit St. Jude.
 Corporations such as Target, Best Buy, Domino's Pizza, the Williams-Sonoma family of brands, CVS/pharmacy, Kmart, Kay Jewelers, New York & Company, 7-Eleven, Inc., American Airlines, American Kiosk Management, AutoZone, Brooks Brothers, Busch Gardens, Catherines, Diane von Fürstenberg, Dollar General, DXL Group, Easy Spirit, General Nutrition Centers, Gymboree, HSN, J. P. Morgan Chase, Marshall's, Alor, The Melting Pot, Memphis Grizzlies (NBA), Nine West, Rochester, Sag Harbor, Saks Fifth Avenue, SeaWorld, St. Louis Rams (NFL), West Elm, Westfield Shoppingtowns, and Yahoo! give customers a host of opportunities to support St. Jude.[24] The ultimate goal is to increase awareness with the hope that people will come to identify Thanksgiving with St. Jude, said Joyce Aboussie, vice chairwoman of the nonprofit's board.[25] The official kick-off event for the Thanks and Giving campaign is the Give Thanks Walk. This event is a noncompetitive 5K that is now held in 75 cities across the country. Those participating in the race are encouraged to form teams, invite family and friends, and raise money for St. Jude. These walks have raised over $11 million to date.[26]

 Many high schools around the country are creating student-led and student-run organizations called Team Up for St. Jude. These programs consist of high school students putting on events that raise funds and awareness for St. Jude while showing their school spirit. One of the main events is a letter writing campaign in which the students are sent pre-written letters that include stories of a patient and ask for donations. The high school students often have a ""letter writing party"" to address and send the letters to their family and friends asking them to support St. Jude.[27] 
Hoover High School (Hoover, AL) has a program that has brought in many fundraising ideas including ""Team Up Week"" which consists of prize wheels, inflatables, karaoke, cake walk, etc. to raise funds and awareness for the hospital.[28] Though this program is done on a much a smaller scale than the college program Up 'til Dawn, it has the potential to grow and increase awareness.
 At various college campuses, some student organizations, fraternities and sororities raise funds in a program called Up 'til Dawn[29]
Phi Mu Delta National Fraternity is partnered with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The fraternity's second core belief, ""I Believe in Service... service to the college; service to every group organized for the common good; service to the individual. I believe in service defined in the terms of voluntary sacrifice for the welfare of those with whom I come in contact."" has helped shape many young men of admirable quality and exceptional character towards a dedication to St. Jude and other equally important causes.[30]
Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) Fraternity partnered with St. Jude in the 1970s and 1980s to help raise money to fight childhood cancer. The fraternity renewed its link to St. Jude as its philanthropy of emphasis in 2008.[31][32]
 St. Jude is an International Philanthropic Project of Epsilon Sigma Alpha International, a co-ed service sorority. As of April 2013, ESA has raised more than $160 million in cash and pledges for St. Jude.[33][34]
 In 1999, the Delta Delta Delta collegiate sorority formed a philanthropic partnership with St. Jude.[35] Tri Delta supports St. Jude nationally and supports cancer charities at a local level.[36]  At the hospital in Memphis, the sorority donated the Teen Room for teenage patients to relax and spend time with each other. In July 2010, Tri Delta completed its ""10 by 10"" goal, raising over $10 million in less than four years, six years short of the original goal. Those funds were used to sponsor the Tri Delta Patient Care Floor in the Chili's Care Center. Upon completion of the ""10 by 10"" campaign, the sorority announced a new fundraising goal of $15 million in 5 years to name the Specialty Clinic located in the Patient Care Center.[37] Three and a half years later, Delta Delta Delta had raised $15 million and completed its goal ahead of schedule.[38] In July 2014, the on-campus residence center was renamed Tri Delta Place as a result of Tri Delta's pledge of $60 Million in 10 years.[39]
 In July 2005, Kappa Alpha Psi (ΚΑΨ) fraternity announced St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as its national philanthropic partner. Since that time, members across the country have joined in the fight against pediatric cancer, sickle cell disease, and other catastrophic illnesses. Kappa Alpha Psi has answered the call to service by raising more than $400,000—representing the largest contribution that Kappa Alpha Psi has donated to any charity. Members of Kappa Alpha Psi have committed to raise $500,000 in support of the hospital's sickle cell program. St. Jude has one of the largest pediatric sickle cell research and treatment programs in the world. St. Jude is the first known hospital in the world to cure sickle cell disease through bone marrow transplantation. Today, bone marrow transplantation still offers the only cure for sickle cell disease. Members of Kappa Alpha Psi reach out to churches in their local communities to host a Sunday of Hope each January in support of St. Jude. January was selected because this is the month of Kappa's founding. During the Sunday of Hope, churches will take up a special offering in honor of the patients and families of St. Jude. At the 2008 ALSAC/St. Jude Board and Awards Dinner, Kappa Alpha Psi received the Volunteer Group of the Year Award for their efforts in the inaugural year of the Sunday of Hope program which secured more than 130 churches to participate and raised more than $280,000.[40]
 Lambda Theta Alpha sorority serves thousands of hours each year to a variety of philanthropic causes and needs. In the effort to create a more united and bigger impact nationally, Lambda Theta Alpha selected a national philanthropy. In January 2010, LTA became an official collegiate partner to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, becoming the first individual Latino Greek organization to commit fully to the hospital's efforts. With this partnership, LTA provides our resources of community service and activism and more importantly, another direct link to the Hispanic community for St. Jude. LTA has pledged to raise awareness about childhood cancer and St. Jude in the Latin community, as well as fundraise for the hospital through a variety of events and programs.[41][42]
 Past events have included: sporting tournaments, charity galas, informational meetings, and much more.[42]
 Another successful event is the Country Cares for St. Jude Kids radio-thon. During these events, country radio stations around the country allow those touched by St. Jude to share stories with listeners, highlighting patient stories, and having exciting promotions. Listeners are encouraged to call in and become a Partner In Hope by making either a one-time or monthly donation to the hospital. The 200 stations involved have helped raise over $400 million since 1989. Country artists have also supported St. Jude through concerts, hospital visits, call-ins, and other forms of support.[43]
 Eagles for St. Jude is a program created during Stanford Financial Group’s inaugural sponsorship year of the Stanford St. Jude Championship out of the desire to provide a season-long fundraising component to the Memphis PGA tournament.
 In 1995, St. Jude received an anonymous letter postmarked in Dallas, Texas, containing a $1 million winning McDonald's Monopoly game piece.  McDonald's officials came to the hospital, accompanied by a representative from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, and verified it as a winner.[44] Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, and even after learning that the piece was sent by an individual involved in an embezzlement scheme intended to defraud McDonald's, McDonald's waived the rule and made the annual $50,000 annuity payments.[45]
 St. Jude Children's Research celebrity visitors are individuals that are in the entertainment industry who visit the children in the hospital. Over the years, many celebrities such as musicians, political figures, actors and others have become involved with this foundation. Hollywood actors visit the hospital to meet some of the kids and try to get involved. Other celebrities have filmed commercials to encourage individuals to donate to St. Jude. Some of the most recognized celebrities that have visited St. Jude to see the effort going on daily in order to combat catastrophic illnesses are:[46]"
Starlight Children's Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlight_Children%27s_Foundation	"Starlight Children's Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded in 1982 for hospitalized children and their families.
 Starlight programs offer entertainment, education and technology to critically, chronically and terminally ill children. These programs are provided directly to children through Starlight's network of more than 700 children's hospitals and other community health partners throughout North America. Starlight's US operations are based in Los Angeles, California.[1] The charity has provided support to more than 60 million children in the US, Canada, Australia and the UK where it has additional office locations and programs.[2]
 Starlight Children's Foundation was founded in 1982 by actors Peter Samuelson and Emma Samms, who was inspired by her brother's death, at age 8, from aplastic anemia.[3] Steven Spielberg serves as the organization's Chairman Emeritus.[4] Starlight's current CEO is Adam Garone.[5] Before Starlight, Adam was the co-founder and CEO of Movember Foundation.
 The first-ever private social network, started in 1995 by filmmaker and Chairman Emeritus Steven Spielberg, Peter Samuelson and Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.[2] It served to connect chronically ill teenagers with life-threatening medical conditions, and their siblings,[6][7] in a safe, online community where they could chat, blog, post content, and meet others who shared similar experiences.[8]  Starbright World was taken offline on August 31, 2015.
 In 2016, Starlight earned a 4-star rating from Charity Navigator, America's largest independent charity evaluator.[9] Starlight is a gold-level GuideStar participant.[10] Starlight is a CharityWatch Top Rated non-profit with an A rating.[11]
 Starlight partners with nearly 700 children's hospitals, hospice centers, outpatient homes and rehabilitation centers nationwide, including:
 Starlight partners with brands and companies, charitable foundations, organizations and socially aware groups, and philanthropic individuals. Below are a list of a few corporate partners:"
Stichting INGKA Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stichting_INGKA_Foundation	"Flowchart showing the structure and ownership of IKEA companies.
Parent companies are at the top of the chart.

 The Stichting INGKA Foundation is a Dutch foundation founded in 1982 by Ingvar Kamprad, a Swedish billionaire and founder of IKEA, and his corporate attorney Linnea Walsh. INGKA is one of the largest charitable foundations in the world and used to be one of the largest nonprofit organisations in the world.[1][2] The name ""INGKA"" comes from a contraction of his name, while stichting is the Dutch language word for foundation. The stated purpose of the foundation is ""To promote and support innovation in the field of architectural and interior design""; however, the organization has recently[when?] expanded its philanthropic agenda to target children in the developing world.[citation needed]
 The foundation contributes funds via the IKEA Foundation which works with the UNHCR.[3][4] It is one of the seven international entities who support the UNHCR camp office in Kutupalong (Bangladesh) for the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.[5]
 The foundation owns the private Dutch company INGKA Holding, based in Leiden, which is the holding company that controls 315 of the 360 outlets of IKEA.[6]
 In an explanation of IKEA's complex corporate structure, Ingvar Kamprad stated to the authors of a Swedish documentary that tax efficiency was ""a natural part of the company's low-cost culture"".[1] Sweden had in 1982 very high Inheritance tax for larger fortunes, and the tax on the profit of selling stocks to pay for the tax was added. The foundation also provides an anti-takeover protection scheme for IKEA.[7] The Dutch Tax Service at that time applied the ""Institution for General Benefit"" (algemeen nut beogende instelling, ANBI) status to the Stichting IKEA Foundation.[8] According to the ANBI register in the Netherlands, Stichting INGKA Foundation lost ANBI status in 2010, but was registered as an ANBI from January 1, 2008 until January 1, 2010. Due to changes in Dutch tax law,[9] Stichting INGKA Foundation does not currently hold ANBI status.[10][11]
 In 2017, the foundation donated 159 million euros to the IKEA Foundation of which 144 million was subsequently donated.[12]
 In May 2006, The Economist magazine estimated that the foundation was worth US$36 billion, making it the world's wealthiest charity at the time; however, it also stated that the foundation ""is at the moment also one of its least generous. The overall set-up of IKEA minimises tax and disclosure, handsomely rewards the founding Kamprad family and makes IKEA immune to a takeover"".[7] Following the publication of the Economist article, Ingvar Kamprad went to court in the Netherlands to expand the goals of the foundation, whereby more money would be spent on children in the developing world.[13] Prior to this, the foundation's articles of association limited the foundation's purpose to ""innovation in the field of architectural and interior design"" and it had given a relatively small amount of its assets to the Lund Institute of Technology.[7]"
Students Helping Honduras	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_Helping_Honduras	"Students Helping Honduras (SHH) is an international NGO operating in both the United States and Honduras.  While the majority of its projects are centered on the peripheries of El Progreso, the organization engages in projects throughout all of Honduras.
 Shin Fujiyama and his sister Cosmo Fujiyama first traveled to Honduras in the summer of 2004, volunteering on a mission trip organized by the Campus Christian Community of the University of Mary Washington to help victims of poverty and domestic abuse.[1]  Shin met and grew close to the people of a squatter village called Siete de Abril (Spanish for April 7th); the villagers, whose homes had been destroyed by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, named the village after the date on which their sudden homelessness forced them to establish it. Having borne witness to the harsh conditions in which the villagers and their children lived, Shin vowed to help them overcome poverty.  The semester following his trip, Shin founded Students Helping Honduras (SHH) as an official student organization within his university, as did his sister, who attended the College of William & Mary.[2]
 The organization, which began as a small group of students eager to help the siblings fulfill their mission, began to hold local events in an effort to raise funds.  Their first walkathon, held in the spring of 2006, raised over $148,000 with the help of a matching grant from Doris Buffett, founder of The Sunshine Lady Foundation.  Those proceeds allowed the students to travel back to Honduras and build a school with the villagers of Siete de Abril.[3]
 While constructing the school, a 10-year-old girl named Carmen gave a handwritten letter to Shin.  It expressed her dream in which, one day, every family in her village would live in a safer home.  Shin, touched by the now iconic letter, once again mobilized his friends to fulfill her dream.[4]  Doris Buffett offered the students a second matching grant of $100,000, on the condition that the students raise that very amount by the end of the semester.[5][6]  The students reached out to friends from other college campuses including Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia, both of which would establish chapters of SHH. The band of students raised $110,000 by the end of the semester, earning Buffett's matching grant for a combined total of over $210,000.[citation needed]  With this money, SHH was able to purchase a land title on which the villagers could live legally, and they had raised enough money to build one cinder block house for each family from Siete de Abril.
 Shin registered Students Helping Honduras as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in 2007,[7] as advised by Dr. Gregory Stanton, founder of Genocide Watch.  Today the organization hosts service trips throughout the year as part of its formal operations.  Students and adults travel to Honduras in groups to assist with construction, build relationships with the local residents and witness the conditions in which they live.  Respectively, these three activities facilitate most of the progress of the organization, by: (a) shortening the project completion time; (b) building trust and fidelity between the villagers and the organization; and (c) stoking passion within trip participants to support those villagers upon returning to the United States.
 Students Helping Honduras has restructured its governing body in at least two ways since its inception: it has rewritten its mission statement and instituted a Student Board to represent the interests of student volunteers.
 This project consists of forty-four 22'x 28' homes, each with three bedrooms, a central room, bathroom, and shower. The design of the homes and the entire village was based on drawings made by the villagers. The village will also include a community center usable for church gatherings or town meetings, land for farming and sustainable businesses, a well, a library, eco-friendly waste management system, electricity, and most importantly, a soccer field.[8]
 SHH is providing girls from underprivileged communities and orphanages the opportunity to study at the best universities in Honduras. The program offers group housing and full scholarships to qualified candidates. Currently, four girls live in the house, and the number is expected to reach fifteen by 2012.[9]
 La Ceiba seeks to empower women in Honduras as they develop business plans, undergo training, and create their own businesses.[10]
 These stoves significantly reduce the amount of indoor pollution in households utilizing traditional fuel stoves. This includes as smoke and carbon monoxide, the fourth leading cause of death for children under the age of five in developing countries. Through its efficient design, these stoves require only half of the amount of firewood compared to an ordinary stove and have significantly contributed to the health of villagers in Siete de Abril.
 In 2008, SHH built a three-room elementary school at the village of Por Venir that is currently enrolling nearly 150 children.
 The families of Unidos Venceremos came together in 2007 to build a provisional, one-classroom school to educate their children. One teacher provides education to 30 children of all ages and grades. The growing community hopes to upgrade the school into a cinder block facility with a bathroom that will recycle rain water.[11]
 La Nunez elementary school has been in operation since 1998. Today, six teachers serve 150 children. Their current 3-classroom structure is made of rotting wood and tin. Their goal is to build a 3 classroom cinder block school. The families are extremely organized and have raised the funds to pay for a skilled mason to help with the construction.[12]
 The Rio Chiquito Elementary School has been in operation since 2000. Six teachers serve 134 children in just two classrooms. With an increasing population in the area, Rio Chiquito is hoping to build 3 to 4 additional classrooms and refurbish the existing classrooms.[13]
 Las Flores elementary and middle school was founded in the 1960s in the deep banana fields of El Progreso. It serves more than 300 children from 7 surrounding villages. In response to the increase in the number of students recently, the families organized bake sales and penny drives to build four provisional classrooms.  They hope to build walls for these open air classrooms to protect the children from rain, noise and gang members in the area. Las Flores is also hoping to build three new classrooms for the middle school.
[14]
 Pesca Milagrosa is a school which is intended to serve the disabled children in San Manuel. This school will serve 200 children with a variety of disabilities.
 SHH opened the Villa Soleada Children's Home in 2011. The project provides shelter, food, education a loving family, and a sense of community to the orphaned and abandoned children in northern Honduras.[15]
 In order to sustain the home, a sister organization of SHH called the Central American Children's Institute (CeCI) has developed the ""One Cup of Coffee"" program. Members give $4 each month, or the cost of one cup of coffee that will go straight towards providing food, shelter, education and loving staff members for the children in our children's home. Membership to this program is hoped to reach 500 donors by the end of the year.[16]
 Upon its completion, this ""hotel"" in Villa Soleada helps house student volunteers of SHH. Along with housing the volunteers, it provides a number of jobs to local people who will run the facility, including but not limited to jobs in teaching, cooking, construction, and agriculture.
 The membership of SHH consists of more than two thousand students, young professionals, and adults from fifteen states and twenty chapters.  Chapters are typically located on college campuses (U.S.) and high schools.[17]
 U.S. college campus chapters include:

Surdna Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surdna_Foundation	"The Surdna Foundation was established as a charitable foundation in 1917 by John Emory Andrus to pursue a range of philanthropic purposes.
 A devoted family man with nine children, Andrus founded the Julia Dyckman Andrus Memorial in 1928 as a tribute to his beloved wife. She had been orphaned as a child, and in her honor Andrus bought a farm in Westchester County, New York in order to establish an orphanage. The Memorial later changed its name to the Surdna Foundation, with ""Surdna"" being the backward spelling of the family name Andrus.
 In 1953 Andrus' youngest child, Helen Benedict, was serving as the chairman of Surdna.[2] That year the foundation built the John E. Andrus Memorial, a retirement home for 200 elderly residents on land adjacent to the Julia Dyckman Andrus Memorial. She and the Foundation thereby completed his expressed wish that his legacy provide ""opportunity for youth and rest for old age."" In the early 1970s, the board of the Julia Dyckman Andrus Memorial shifted its programmatic emphasis to serve as a residential treatment, special education and diagnostic center for emotionally disabled children.
 Family stewardship of Surdna over the years has been informed by Andrus's values: thrift, practicality, modesty, loyalty, excellence and an appreciation for direct service to those in need. These values have been applied both to oversight of the two Memorials and to more general grant programs. In 1989, the third and fourth generations of the Andrus family on the Surdna board established programs in Environment and Community Revitalization and decided to enlarge the professional staff to broaden the Foundation's effectiveness. In 1994, programs in Effective Citizenry and the Arts were added. The Nonprofit Sector Support Program was added in 1997 to address crosscutting issues affecting the sector.
 In 2019 some descendants of John Emory Andrus questioned whether the foundation had deviated from Andrus's original goals and stated that the foundation was planning on focusing all its efforts on racial equity.[3][4]
 The Comprehensive Community Revitalization Program (CCRP) was a $10 million effort by 21 foundations and corporations (initiated by the Surdna Foundation in 1991). Its goal was to materially boost the quality of life in a large swath of the South Bronx, to support a group of CDCs by buying into their agenda for doing so, and to (later) create an institution that could live on vigorously and independently after the program formally concluded in 1998.[5]"
Survivor Corps	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_Corps	"Survivor Corps is a global network of survivors helping survivors to recover from war, rebuild their communities, and break cycles of violence.  The organization currently operates programs in Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burundi, Colombia, Croatia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Georgia, Jordan, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Uganda, Rwanda, the United States and Vietnam.
 Survivor Corps is a leading proponent of the peer support method, in which survivors are linked to one another to share information as well as emotional and practical support, and work together on issues affecting their lives.  The Survivor Corps peer support program connects survivors with survivor role models to offer encouragement and motivation. Peer support is used to help new survivors find hope, get jobs, and get on with their lives.
 Survivor Corps also brings conflict survivors together to promote reconciliation and rebuilding through community service projects and local activism.
 By training and organizing survivor advocates to campaign for their rights, survivor corps has brought the voices of survivors into international negotiations, to ban weapons that cause unacceptable harm to civilians and to honor the rights of survivors of war and of persons with disabilities.
 In May 2008, Survivor Corps emerged from Landmine Survivors Network. The name change reflects the expansion of the organization's mission to include all types of survivors of global conflict and war, including United States service members and veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Survivor Corps has long played a leading role the International Campaign to Ban Landmines coalition (ICBL), which has over 1100 member organizations and whose goal is to abolish the production and use of anti-personnel landmines.  Survivor Corps co-founders Jerry White and Ken Rutherford helped lead the coalition's efforts that secured the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which in turn earned the coalition the Nobel Peace Prize. Prominent Survivor Corps supporters have included Queen Noor of Jordan and Diana, Princess of Wales.
 The Mine Ban Treaty bans the use, stockpiling, production and trade of antipersonnel mines. It was also the first arms control agreement in history to require governments to provide assistance to victims of the weapon.  This was achieved by an unprecedented level of participation by survivors in the treaty process.[1]
 The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities entered into force on May 3, 2008, affecting 650 million people with disabilities around the world, including survivors of violent conflict.  Survivor Corps helped ensure that this progressive human rights treaty addressed persons with disabilities not as charity cases, but as equal and autonomous citizens entitled to their human rights and full participation in society.
 The Convention on Cluster Munitions was signed in Oslo on December 3, 2008 and entered into force on 1 August 2010.  It bans the use, stockpiling, production and trade of cluster bombs due to the indiscriminate harm they cause to civilians.  As a leader on the steering committee of the Cluster Munitions Coalition, Survivor Corps used its past experience with the Mine Ban Treaty to help ensure that the Convention on Cluster Munitions included the strongest possible requirements to provide assistance to victims of the weapon, their families and communities.
 Over the course of several years, Survivor Corps established the first database designed to track the rehabilitation needs of mine victims and the resources available to help survivors, their families, and the communities affected by anti-personnel mines.
 In 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales visited Bosnia with LSN co-founders Jerry White and Ken Rutherford to meet landmine survivors. Her high-profile tour of the war-torn country brought global media attention and public support to the issue of landmines.  After the death of Diana, the organization became the only American-based charity to receive support from the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. Also in 1997, Queen Noor of Jordan stepped in to take a prominent role in supporting the organization's work.
 In 1999, along with Queen Noor and key members of the United States Congress, including Senator Patrick Leahy, the organization drew international attention to the refusal of the United States to sign the Mine Ban Treaty, while appealing to the US to revisit landmine policy.
 From 1997 to 2007, LSN provided health support, economic opportunity and human rights advocacy for survivors of landmines around the world.
 In May 2008, Landmine Survivors Network changed its name to Survivor Corps. The name change reflects the expansion of their mission to include all types of survivors of global conflict and war, including United States service members and veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Survivor Corps expanded its programs into Israel, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, and created additional projects in Colombia.
 In early 2010 Survivor Corps elected to make its country programs in Vietnam,[2] El Salvador[3] and Bosnia[4] into independent NGOs and to transfer its peer support resources to the Center for International Stabilization and Recovery located at James Madison University.[5]
 On September 30, 2010 Survivor Corps closed its headquarters office in Washington DC.[6]"
Susan G. Komen for the Cure	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_G._Komen_for_the_Cure	"Susan G. Komen, formerly known as Susan G. Komen for the Cure and originally as The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, often referred to as simply Komen, is the largest and best-funded breast cancer organization in the United States.[4]
 According to the Harris Interactive 2010 EquiTrend annual brand equity poll, Komen was once one of the most trusted non-profit organizations in America.[5][6] Komen's 2012 decision to discontinue funding for Planned Parenthood was controversial and brief, attracting widespread media attention and a significant decline in donations and participation at fundraising events.[7][8] Komen almost immediately reversed its decision and resumed its funding of breast cancer screening and other programs at various Planned Parenthood locations.[9][10] The organization has also been criticized for executive pay raises, administrative costs, affiliations with certain sponsors and claims that it used misleading statistics in advertising.[11][12][13] In six years from 2011 to 2017 revenue declined by about 80% and a number of state chapters closed.[14]
 In March 2013, Komen's ranking on Charity Navigator dropped from four stars (the highest rating) to three stars, going to two stars in 2014.[15] As of June 2016, Komen was back to three stars, with a score of 81 out of 100.[16]
 Susan Goodman, later Susan Goodman Komen, was born on October 31, 1943 in Peoria, Illinois. She was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 33.[17] She died of the disease at age 36 on August 4, 1980.[18][19] Komen's younger sister, Nancy Goodman Brinker, who believed that Susan's outcome might have been better if patients knew more about cancer and its treatment, promised her sister that she would do everything she could to end breast cancer.[18][20] To fulfill that promise, Brinker founded the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation in Komen's memory in 1982.[20]
 In 2008, the 25th anniversary of the organization, the name was changed to Susan G. Komen for the Cure and trademarked a new logo in support of its promise ""to end breast cancer forever.""[21] The new logo is a pink ribbon that resembles a runner in motion[21][22] and is meant to reflect the importance of Komen's signature Race for the Cure event,[22] which is currently the world's largest fund raising event for breast cancer education and research.[23] The logo symbolically associates the organization with the values of breast cancer awareness (""pink ribbon culture""): fear of breast cancer, hope, and the charitable goodness of people and businesses who publicly support the breast cancer movement.[4]
 In December 2009 Brinker was appointed CEO of the organization.[24] Judy Salerno became CEO of the organization in 2012. In November 2016, the organization announced that Salerno would step down as CEO the following month.[25]
 In 2017, former fashion executive and breast cancer survivor Paula Schneider took over as CEO.[26]
 Komen's Mission Statement: Save lives by meeting the most critical needs in our communities and investing in breakthrough research to prevent and cure breast cancer.[27]
 Komen's Bold Goal: In 2016, Susan G. Komen announced their Bold Goal ""Reduce the current number of breast cancer deaths by 50% in the U.S. by 2026.""[27]
 Komen's philosophy mixes education, action, research, and community involvement. To date, Komen has funded more than $800 million in breast cancer research.[28] Patient navigation is a main focal point for Komen, especially in recent years. Most recently they were in D.C. to advocate to reduce insurance barriers to breast cancer treatment.[29] In line with their Bold Goal, Susan G. Komen partnered with BreastCancerTrials.org to create a new tool to help people living with metastatic breast cancer find clinical trials.[30]
 Many scientific reviews have criticized Komen for overpromoting mammography. They concluded that indiscriminate screening mammography for all middle-aged and older women, regardless of each woman's individual risk of developing breast cancer, results in overtreatment of some women whose cancer would never harm them. For every one woman whose life is saved by screening mammography, 250 to 500 women will be told that they might have breast cancer when they don't (false positives), 125 to 250 will have biopsies performed, and between two and ten women will receive unnecessary treatment.[31][32][33]
 Other organizations like the National Breast Cancer Coalition follow a ""medical consumerism"" model in which individual women are educated by their physicians about their options and encouraged to make individualized, evidence-based decisions about their health care.[34] Other organizations advocate more research into the environmental causes of breast cancer and cancer prevention.[34]
 Komen's 2009–2010 Expenses
 In the 2009–2010 fiscal year, ending March 31, 2010, Komen reported approximately US$400 million in earnings. Of this, $365 million (91.3 %) came from contributions from the public, including donations, sponsorships, race entry fees, and contributed goods and services. Approximately $35 million (8.8 %) came from interest and dividends and gains on investments.[35]
 That same fiscal year, Komen reported approximately US$360 million in expenses. $283.2 million of this went towards program services: $75.4 million (20.9 % of total expenditure) went to research, $140.8 million (39.1 %) went to public health education, $46.9 million (13 %) went to health screening services, and $20.1 million (5.6 %) went to treatment services. The other $76.8 million went to supporting services, including $36.1 million (10 % of total expenditure) toward fund-raising costs and $40.6 million (11.3 %) toward general and administrative costs.[35]
 The Komen CEO salary in 2010 was $459,406 a year.[36] Komen paid founder and CEO Nancy Brinker $417,712 in 2011.[37]  After the Planned Parenthood controversy, donations dropped and the foundation canceled half of its fundraising 'Race for the Cure' events, but Brinker received a 64% increase to $684,000 annually,  which drew fire and was considered ""extremely high"" according to Charity Navigator's CEO.[38]
 The organization reported that its CEO earned $565,048 of compensation from the Foundation and related organizations during 2016 on its annual return to the Internal Revenue Service.[2] The organization also reported 14 other employees who each earned more than $175,000 of compensation, bonuses, retirement benefits, and other benefits during 2016.[2]
 Since its foundation in 1982, Komen has provided funding for basic, clinical, and translational breast cancer research and for innovative projects in the areas of breast health education and breast cancer screening and treatment. The organization has awarded more than 1,000 breast cancer research grants totaling more than $180 million.[39]
 As of 2007[update], research grants are available for basic, clinical, and translational research; postdoctoral fellowships; and breast cancer disparities research.[40]
 Komen awards three-year postdoctoral fellowships to individuals working under the guidance of experienced cancer researchers in order to recruit and retain young scientists in the field of breast cancer research.
In addition to funding research, Komen and its affiliates fund non-duplicative, community-based breast health education and breast cancer screening and treatment projects for the medically under-served.[39]
 Since 1992, Komen has also annually awarded work in the field of cancer research with the Komen Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction.
 In recent years, Komen has cut by nearly half the proportion of fund-raising dollars it spends on research grants, according to a 2012 Reuters analysis. In 2011, the foundation spent $63 million (15 %) of its donations on research grants and awards.[37][41][42]
 Around 458,000 people worldwide die from breast cancer every year.[43] Komen works with local communities and organizations to develop culturally-appropriate programs.[44]
 In 2006, Susan G. Komen joined the US-Middle East Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research, a Middle East Partnership Initiative program. Komen has programs in Egypt, Israel, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.[45][46]-->
 In 2010, Susan G. Komen was active in over 50 countries, with its largest affiliates in Italy and Germany.[47]
 On October 28, 2010, Jerusalem held its first Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure, with over 5,000 Christian, Muslim, and Jewish participants.[48]Prior to the race, the Old City's walls were illuminated pink by Komen's founder Nancy G. Brinker, Jerusalem's Israeli Mayor Nir Barkat, and the Prime Minister of Israel's wife Sara Netanyahu.
 The Organization raises over $36 million a year from over 60 cause marketing partnerships.  These include prominent campaigns, such as those with Yoplait, which runs the Save Lids to Save Lives program, and a partnership with Delta Air Lines.[49]
 Cause marketing allows Komen to associate the breast cancer brand with its organization.  By promoting the ""fear, hope and goodness"" associated with the breast cancer brand, Komen is able to promote itself, breast cancer awareness, its sponsoring corporations, and conscientious consumption.[50]
 The Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure is the world's largest fundraising event for breast cancer.[51] It consists of a series of 5K runs and fitness walks to raise money for breast cancer, to raise awareness of the disease, to celebrate those who have survived breast cancer, and memorialize those who have not.
 The first race was run in Dallas, Texas in 1983, with 800 participants.[52] The 25th Anniversary of the Race was celebrated in 2008. In 2009, it was renamed as Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure.[53] In 2010, there were about 130 races worldwide.[54] Additionally in 2010, over 1.6 million people participated in the race, which utilized over 100,000 volunteers.[55]
 The primary source of revenue for the event is donations collected by the participants in the race. In 2011, Komen said that three-quarters of the net proceeds from the event were being used locally to pay for community outreach programs, breast health education, and breast cancer screening and treatment projects run by the Komen affiliate, and the remaining quarter was being sent to the central organization.[54]
 Komen's other nationwide events include:
 In October 2008, Susan G. Komen launched a mobile donating campaign, allowing supporters to donate money by texting.[58]
 Top organizations include:
 
 Komen is a key entity in the controversy over pinkwashing. The term ""pinkwashing"" has been used to describe two different situations; 1) organizations getting disproportionately large amounts of publicity for donating very little, and 2) organizations that use the pink ribbon to promote products that may be carcinogenic.
 Komen benefits from corporate partnerships, receiving over $55 million a year[59] from 216 corporate sponsors.[60] However, critics say many of these promotions are deceptive to consumers, benefit the companies more than the charity, and promote products that may even cause cancer.[61]
 Some campaigns require that consumers mail proof of purchase for a promoted item before the manufacturer donates a few cents per purchase to charity; some have a cap on the maximum amount donated, with all sales beyond this fixed limit benefiting only the company, not the promoted cause.[62]
Since their Save Lids to Save Lives campaign began in 1998, Yoplait has donated more than $25 million to Komen. In 2010, their annual maximum commitment was raised to $1.6 million.[63]
In return, a major sponsor such as Yoplait obtains an exclusive contract; no other yogurt manufacturer (such as Dreyer's, who inquired in 2000) has the opportunity to use the branding.[64]  In 2002, credit card operator American Express launched a ""Charge for a Cure"" campaign which claimed that ""in the search for a cure, every dollar counts."" The amount donated per qualifying transaction, regardless of purchase amount, was one penny.[65]
 In 2006, Major League Baseball partnered with Komen by selling and donating amounts from pink MLB Louisville Slugger bats, pink baseballs, and necklaces sold. On Mother's Day, breast cancer survivors were eligible to be used as bat girls in games where pink bats were used.  MLB, a $1.2 billion industry, donates around $100,000 a year.[66]
  Several water bottle retailers have partnered with the Komen Foundation.[67][68] Water cooler bottles made of Polycarbonate may contain BPA, which has been linked to breast cancer tumor growth.[69] For the 2008 model year, Ford Motor Company built a branded limited edition of 2500 Ford Mustang motorcars with a ""Warriors in Pink"" package[70] as part of their long-running association with Komen;[71] an additional 1000 were offered for 2009's model year.[72] A longitudinal study found that women employed in the automotive plastics industry are almost five times as likely to develop breast cancer prior to menopause, compared to women in a control group.[73][74]
 In April 2010, Komen paired with fast food restaurant chain KFC to offer ""Buckets for the Cure,"" a promotion in which fried and grilled chicken was sold in pink branded buckets. The collaboration garnered criticism from media outlets, including The Colbert Report[75] and Bitch magazine,[76] and raised criticisms about the promotion of unhealthy eating habits, as KFC chicken is known to contain carcinogenic chemicals.[77][78] KFC contributed over $4.2 million to Komen, the largest single contribution in the organization's history.[79] The partnership with KFC, which has since ended, allowed Komen ""to reach many millions of women that they had been unable to reach before,"" said Brinker.[59]
 In April 2011, Komen introduced its own perfume brand, ""Promise Me"", promoted by Komen CEO Nancy Brinker on the Home Shopping Network,[80] only to encounter opposition due to coumarin, oxybenzone, toluene and galaxolide as potentially harmful ingredients. Komen stated its intention to have the product reformulated but failed to withdraw existing stocks of the ""Promise Me"" product from distribution.[81]
 In October 2014, Houston-based oil field services company Baker Hughes was reported to have produced 1,000 pink drill bits to raise breast cancer awareness. The land drill bits are used to break up geologic formations in oil patches for hydraulic fracturing.[82] These ties have been criticized, because of the more than 700 chemicals used in fracking more than one third are endocrine disruptors and at least one quarter increase the risk of cancer.[83]
 In 2007, the organization changed its name to Susan G. Komen for the Cure and trademarked the running ribbon as part of its new branding strategy.[84] Komen has come under fire for legal action against other non-profits or organizations using the phrase ""for the cure"" within their names. An August 2010 article in The Wall Street Journal detailed a case in which the organization Uniting Against Lung Cancer was told in a letter from Komen that they should no longer use the name ""Kites for the Cure"" for their annual fund-raising event. Komen also wrote to the organization to warn them ""against any use of pink in conjunction with 'cure.'""[85] More than 100 small charities have received legal opposition from Komen regarding various uses of the words ""for the cure"" in their names.[86] Among the offending charitable organizations and events were ""Par for the Cure"", ""Surfing for a Cure"", ""Cupcakes for a Cure"" and ""Mush for the Cure"".[86]
 Komen says that the organization protects its trademarks as a matter of financial stewardship in order to prevent confusion among donors.
 Others suggest that the trademark issue is more about dominating the pink ribbon market.[87]
 Critics have also asserted that the slogan itself implies the majority of Komen's funds go to research, specifically research to find a means to cure (and not merely treat or detect) the disease. By Komen's own figures, however, 21% of the total budget goes to research.[88]  In the words of cancer survivor Alicia Staley,[89] ""an organization that is actively pursuing other small charities over the use of the term 'for the cure' does not spend the majority of their own funds towards research for a cure.""[90]
 Beginning in 2007, Komen granted money to pay for 170,000 clinical breast exams and 6,400 mammogram referrals at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and affiliates.[91][92] Komen had said its affiliates provide funds for screening, education and treatment programs in dozens of communities in which Planned Parenthood is the only place that poor, uninsured or under-insured women can receive these services.[93][94]
 On January 31, 2012, Komen stopped funding exams provided by Planned Parenthood, citing a congressional investigation by Rep. Cliff Stearns and a newly created internal rule about not funding organizations under any federal, state or local investigation.[95] While the move was applauded by conservative religious and anti-abortion groups,[96] it was denounced by several editorials, women's health advocacy groups,[96][97][98][99] and politicians.[100][101]
 In the 24 hours after the news broke, Planned Parenthood received more than $400,000 from 6,000 donors,[96] followed by pledges of a $250,000 matching grant from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg[102] and a $250,000 gift from a foundation run by the CEO of Bonanza Oil Co. in Dallas to replace the lost funding.[103]
 Four days later, Komen's Board of Directors reversed the decision and announced that it would amend the policy to ""make clear that disqualifying investigations must be criminal and conclusive in nature and not political"".[104] Several top-level staff members resigned from Komen during the controversy.[105][106][107] In August, Brinker announced she would leave her CEO role.[108] The number of participants at various Komen fundraising events dropped 15–30% in 2012, compared to the previous year.[8][109] The Susan G. Komen 3-Day for the Cure fundraising walks were scaled back to seven US cities in 2013, from a former 14 cities, due to a 37 percent drop in participation over the preceding four years.[110]In January 2014 it was reported that the foundation saw a decline of 22% in contributions in the year following their decision to cease (and then continue) funding for Planned Parenthood.[111]
 Karen Handel, the Brinker protégée whose opposition to abortion was at the center of the Planned Parenthood controversy, resigned and has published a book on the controversy titled Planned Bullyhood.[112]
 In 2006, Komen wrote in its newsletter that stem cell research had promise for curing breast cancer.[113] In 2011, the anti-abortion Coalition on Abortion/Breast Cancer said that Komen gave $12 million to instutions such as Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the U.S. National Cancer Institute, that funded stem cell research, which the Coalition considered to be abortion. In 2012, Komen said that it did not fund stem cell research and never has. LifeNews.com then published an article saying that Komen had stopped funding stem cell research. According to Science magazine, Christopher Umbricht got nearly $600,000 from Komen for molecular marker research at Johns Hopkins that includes stem cells.[114][115][116]
 According to Komen's 2011–2012 IRS Form 990 declarations, then-CEO Nancy Brinker made $684,717 in that fiscal year,[117] a 64 percent raise. Komen stated the last CEO salary hike had taken place in November 2010.[118] While Charity Navigator continued to give Komen very favorable overall ratings[15] on the basis of figures Komen had declared to the IRS,[119] Charity Navigator president and CEO Ken Berger described this remuneration as ""extremely high"".
 This pay package is way outside the norm. It's about a quarter of a million dollars more than what we see for charities of this size. This is more than the head of the Red Cross is making for an organization that is one-tenth the size of the Red Cross. After the release of this information, Doctor Judith Salerno was named CEO, with Brinker named Founder and Chair of Global Strategy.[120]"

Thrive Africa	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Africa	"Thrive Africa is a Ghanaian nonprofit registered charitable body, founded in United Kingdom in 2009 with the aim of assisting local communities across Ghana to improve living standards and educational level through a range of self-sustainable projects.[1]
 The charity annually recruits volunteers from across the world and coordinates their efforts to implement development projects, allowing its supporters to not only to promote the advancement of education and relief of poverty, but also to gain personal experience in the development sector.[2][3][4]
 Thrive Africa was founded in 2009 as a registered charity in United Kingdom and Ghana. In 2012 its management was fully transferred to Ghana.
 Every year Thrive Africa donate tens of thousands of books working closely with its partner Book-Cycle, the UK charity.[4] It recruits volunteers, who help local communities to establish school libraries and organise health and sanitation workshops.[5]
 From 2011 Thrive Africa’s volunteers have worked in orphanages, building libraries, building farms for caregivers of HIV/AIDS orphans, running sports lessons and educational workshops,[6][7][8] donating clothes and kits for football players.[3]
 In 2010 British Government and its development partners made the decision that Ghana should become fully self-sufficient and do without outside help by 2020. Nevertheless, about one third of people in this country live below the poverty line (less than $1.25 a day).[9] Therefore, the Thrive Africa’s management aimed at work with the local Ghanaian communities to create long term and self-sustainable projects.[1]"
Tom Joyner Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Joyner_Foundation	"Thomas Joyner (born November 23, 1949) is an American radio host, host of the nationally syndicated The Tom Joyner Morning Show, and also founder of Reach Media Inc., the Tom Joyner Foundation, and BlackAmericaWeb.com.[1]
 Joyner was born in Tuskegee, Alabama, the son of Frances and Hercules L. Joyner.  Tom came from an educated family:  his grandfather Oscar was one of only 3,000 black physicians in the United States, earning a degree in medicine in 1909.[2] Both of his parents were graduates of historically black colleges, and both Tom and his brother Albert attended Tuskegee Institute, now known as Tuskegee University. Tom Joyner graduated with a degree in sociology.[3] While a student at Tuskegee, Joyner joined the fraternity Omega Psi Phi.  At first, his goal was to be a musician, and he joined a band, the Commodores, that included his college friend Lionel Richie, but the band did not make any money and his family encouraged him to seek another way to make a living.[4]
 Joyner had been involved in college radio and began his broadcasting career in Montgomery, Alabama immediately upon graduation, and worked at a number of radio stations in the South and Midwest, including stations in Memphis and St. Louis, before moving to Chicago in early 1978.[5] In Chicago, he first worked at WVON, doing the morning show, but left the station after only three months to work at a competitor, WBMX-FM.[6]  By late July 1978, however, he had been hired away by Charles Mootry, general manager of station WJPC (AM) (now WNTD).  This station, named for ""Johnson Publishing Company"", was owned by John H. Johnson, owner of such black magazines as Jet and Ebony.[7]
 In 1985, Joyner was simultaneously offered two positions: one for a morning show at KKDA-FM (K104) in Dallas and one for an afternoon show at WGCI-FM in Chicago. Instead of choosing between the two, Joyner chose to take both jobs, and for eight years, he commuted daily by plane between the two cities, earning the nicknames ""The Fly Jock"" and ""The Hardest Working Man in Radio"".[8]  He later told Radio Ink magazine that he racked up 7 million frequent flyer miles over the course of his employment at both stations.
 In 1994, Joyner was signed by ABC Radio Networks to host a nationally syndicated program, The Tom Joyner Morning Show, featuring Joyner and a team of comedians and commentators reporting and discussing the latest news and sports of the day, and playing popular R&B songs from the 1970s through the 1990s as well as contemporary R&B hits. Also featured are celebrity guests, on-site remotes (called ""Sky Shows""), and an on-air soap opera, It's Your World which is currently not aired. Southwest Airlines is a prominent sponsor of the radio show, especially Joyner's ""Sky Shows"", and free round-trip airfare to any destination that Southwest flies to is a recurring giveaway on his show.
 Upon signing a contract extension with Westwood on October 17, 2017, Joyner announced that he would retire at the agreement's end (2019), declaring ""I'm retiring, and for the next two years we're going to reminisce, go down Memory Lane and talk about all the things that we've done for the past 25 years.""[9]
 In 2005, a nationally syndicated television show, The Tom Joyner Show, was launched with Joyner as emcee of a one-hour comedy/variety show, combining sketch comedy featuring the Tom Joyner Show Players (his co-hosts from the radio show), talent contests, and musical performances by such artists as  Patti LaBelle, Earth, Wind and Fire, Brian McKnight, Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds and Toni Braxton. The show attracted advertisers such as McDonald's, Chrysler Corporation, Walmart and Southwest Airlines.
 While the program achieved top ratings for a weekly syndicated program themed to African American viewers — even taking the number one show position, although it was in a late night time slot — in such markets as New York and Atlanta, affiliates in other markets were reluctant to upgrade the show to prime time for a targeted audience.[citation needed] Without the opportunity to reach a larger audience in earlier time slots and achieve greater revenues, the show had limited ability to offset the residuals and music clearances required by the many performers appearing on the show.  Despite award recognition, in May 2006, Joyner decided not to continue due to production costs related to the music variety show concept.[citation needed] Re-runs are shown on TV One cable channel.[10]  As for his radio career, Tom Joyner continues to be an influential broadcaster: the TJMS is heard live in over 100 cities, both on-air and via streaming audio, through its syndicator, Reach Media.[11]
 Capitalizing on the popularity of the Tom Joyner Morning Show, Joyner founded The Tom Joyner Foundation.[12][13] The mission of the foundation is to support historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through student scholarship, endowment, and capacity building enhancements.[14] In the foundation's first month, $20,000 was raised in 'Dollars for Scholars' scholarship money.[13] Since 1998, it has raised more than $65 million to help keep students enrolled at HBCUs.
 The charitable foundation prides itself in having the capability of providing donors specifics of what institution and what student is on the receiving end.[13] The Tom Joyner Foundation also hosts an annual cruise named the Fantastic Voyage which also raises money for HBCUs.[15]
 The Hercules Scholarship, named after Tom Joyner's late father, targets male HBCU students enrolled in the School of the Month program.[16] The $1500 scholarship is awarded every Thursday to scholars selected by the School of the Month. Past schools include Dillard University, Stillman College, North Carolina A&T, and more.
 The Full Ride Scholarship is awarded to one freshman entering a HBCU each year, in recognition of academic distinction and personal qualities.[17]
 Central State University[18] in Wilberforce, Ohio, partnered with the foundation by donating $10,000 to jumpstart the program that offers support in the following areas: 
 The Institute for Shipboard Education (ISE),[19] which administers the Semester at Sea study abroad program, partnered with The Tom Joyner Foundation (TJF) to fund two full scholarships for students attending historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to participate in global voyages. ISE and TJF  believe that international exposure is a critical element in today's undergraduate education, offering students a real-life global education experience that will give them an edge in this highly competitive job market. The program is open to students, regardless of their major.
 The foundation is rekindling its partnership with the National Education Association[20] for its Teacher Quality Program, formerly known as the Teacher Certification Program. The program is designed to create new K–12 teachers from HBCU students with a STEM focus.
 As part of its partnerships with black artists, the foundation is celebrating their contributions to HBCUs, the art world and society. These artists' works will be featured throughout the year on its website as well as selling limited editions of some of its pieces.
 In 2005 Warner Books published I'm Just a DJ but ... It Makes Sense to Me written with his longtime writer, Mary Flowers Boyce.  The book chronicles his childhood and early days in radio as well as offers Joyner's thoughts on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (""HBCUs""), the power of the black consumer and fatherhood. In February 2009, Amber Books published Tom Joyner Presents How to Prepare for College, a primer for parents and their children offering specific suggests and advice. The book features a foreword written by Joyner with writers Wil and Thomas LaVeist.
 He appeared with his father and grandfather in the documentary ""Rising from the Rails: The Story of the Pullman Porter"" crediting his family with passing down important values which he passed down to his sons as well. His grandfather Oscar ""Doc"" Joyner was a Pullman porter who became a medical doctor.[22]
 Tom Joyner has had cameo roles in two films-The Gospel (2005)[23][24] and Madea Goes to Jail (2009).[25][26] During the early 1980s he was a host of the Ebony/Jet Showcase, a syndicated television magazine program. He also had another television show, The Tom Joyner Sky Show (2003),[27] and has appeared on many other television programs.[28]
 With his first wife Dora, Joyner has two sons, Thomas Jr. and Oscar, whom he calls ""Killer"" and ""Thriller"".[29] After divorcing his first wife, he married celebrity aerobics instructor-fitness expert Donna Richardson in July 2000.[30][31][32] The two divorced in May 2012.
 According to a DNA analysis performed by African Ancestry Inc., Joyner is descended partially from the Balanta people of Guinea-Bissau.[33]
 Joyner has been an advocate for voter registration and throughout the year promotes voter registration over the air, on his website and during his live ""Sky Shows"" broadcasts. To improve healthy living, Joyner holds a ""Take a Loved One to the Doctor Day"" every April or September. On that day, he rallies families and friends to go to the doctor to get a check-up to prevent any health problems, and particularly treat any existing issues.
 Joyner participated in the 2011 Alzheimer's Association Walk to End Alzheimer's[34] to raise awareness and funds for Alzheimer's research, care and support.
 On October 7, 2004, Joyner was awarded the NAB Marconi Radio Award.[35]
 In 1998, Joyner was the first African American to be inducted into The National Radio Hall of Fame in Chicago, Illinois.[36][37]
 Joyner was inducted into the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame at the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site on January 12, 2008.[38]
Joyner was inducted into The Official R&B Music Hall of Fame on August 17, 2013, in Cleveland, Ohio, at Cleveland State University.
 On June 28, 2015, Joyner was awarded the Humanitarian Award at the 2015 BET Awards."
Toys for Tots	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toys_for_Tots	"Toys for Tots is a program run by the United States Marine Corps Reserve which distributes toys to children whose parents cannot afford to buy them gifts for Christmas.  The program was founded in 1947 by reservist Major Bill Hendricks.[2]
 The Marine Toys for Tots Foundation, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit public charity located in Triangle, Virginia, serves to fund, raise funds for, and support the program.
 Toys for Tots began as a  Los Angeles charitable effort in 1947.  Major Bill Hendricks, USMCR, was inspired by his wife Diane when she tried to donate a homemade Raggedy Ann doll to a needy child but couldn't find any organization to do so. At her suggestion, he gathered a group of local Marine reservists, including Lieutenant Colonel John Hampton,[3] who coordinated and collected some 5,000 toys for local children that year from collection bins placed outside Warner Bros. movie theaters.[3] Their efforts were so successful that, in 1948, Toys for Tots was launched as a national campaign. Hendricks used his position as director of Public Relations for Warner Brothers Studio to enlist celebrity support, as well as have Walt Disney Studios design the red toy train logo.[2] A theme song for the program was written in 1956 by Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster, and would be recorded by Nat King Cole, Jo Stafford, Peggy Lee, among others.[4]
 Until 1979, Marine reservists (frequently in their dress blue uniforms) and volunteers would collect and refurbish used toys. In 1980, only new toys were accepted, as reservists were no longer able to dedicate drill hours to refurbish toys, as well as legal concerns and the mixed message of giving hand-me-downs as a message of hope.[2]
 In 1991, the Secretary of Defense authorized the creation and affiliation with the non-profit charity foundation. In 1995, the Secretary of Defense approved Toys for Tots as an official mission of the Marine Corps Reserve.[5]
 Noting in 1996 that many communities did not have a Marine reservist presence, the commander of the Marine Forces Reserve authorized Marine Corps League detachments and other local organizations to fill the gaps in toy collection and distribution.[5]
 In 2009, the program received support from First Lady Michelle Obama, who placed the first collection box at the White House.[6] In December 2011, she took part in a Toys for Tots activity at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling.[7][8]
 As of 2016[update], the Toys for Tots Program and Foundation have collected and distributed more than 512 million toys.[9]
 The mission of the program ""is to collect new, unwrapped toys during October, November and December each year, and distribute those toys as Christmas gifts to needy children in the community in which the campaign is conducted.""
 The stated goal is to ""deliver, through a new toy at Christmas, a message of hope to less fortunate youngsters that will assist them in becoming responsible, productive, and patriotic citizens.""

Traffic	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_(conservation_programme)	"TRAFFIC, the Wildlife Trade Monitoring Network, is the leading non-governmental organisation working globally on the trade of wild animals and plants in the context of both biodiversity and sustainable development. It was founded in 1976 as a strategic alliance of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).[1]
 The organisation’s aim is to ‘ensure that trade in wild plants and animals is not a threat to the conservation of nature’. It states that through research, analysis, guidance and influence, it promotes sustainable wildlife trade (the green stream work) and combats wildlife crime and trafficking (the red stream work). TRAFFIC's work involves research, publication of influential reports, projects, education, outreach and advocacy on the issue of wildlife trade. TRAFFIC focuses on leveraging resources, expertise and awareness of the latest globally urgent species trade issues.[2]
 Founded in 1979, TRAFFIC's headquarters are located in Cambridge, United Kingdom, with offices located in 15 strategically important locations in Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe and Oceania. Operations are supported over the globe in countries ranging from Madagascar and Japan to Iceland through collaboration projects with other non-profit organisations and governments.
 In the 1970s, there was growing awareness amongst conservation organisations of the threat posed to species by wildlife trade and increasing recognition that there was a lack of information on this issue. The trade of wildlife products, from live exotic animals traded as pets to food products, exotic leather goods and tiger bone medicines, was a threat to species worldwide.
 1975 saw the creation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), providing legally obliging frameworks to all countries who signed up, known as Parties. Its existence made it still more necessary to have a body to monitor this wildlife trade, so TRAFFIC was established by the conservation charity IUCN Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC) to meet this need.
 Initially, TRAFFIC was simply a group of volunteer experts aiming to gather and analyse wildlife trade data and identify illegal trade, TRAFFIC has since grown into a well respected international organisation. Initially it was funded primarily by the Fauna Preservation Society (now Fauna and Flora International) and based in London's Soho district.
 The organisation meanwhile made steps against unsustainable wildlife trade, including launching investigations which found that transport of wildlife frequently went against international regulations, for example, flamingos being transported with their legs bound together. TRAFFIC submitted draft guidelines to CITES on the transport of live creatures, which were adopted subject to minor alterations at the second Conference of Parties. TRAFFIC also called for a public enquiry into UK legislation into endangered species, after demonstrating the ease with which illegal wildlife products could evade Customs.
 During this period the organisation underwent a formalising of its structure, establishing the TRAFFIC Committee as the organisation’s main governing body in 1984. Although the structure has changed, it includes representatives from the two founding organisations, WWF and IUCN, plus independent ones. During the decade, TRAFFIC established 11 new offices worldwide, including in Germany, East Africa, Ecuador and Oceania. TRAFFIC worked on a range of issues, including carrying out major studies on the Indian bird trade, the elephant ivory trade, the European seal skin trade and the reptile skin trade published in the 1984 and 1985 TRAFFIC Bulletins. The research into seals contributed to an EEC ban on the skin of certain seal species, implemented in 1983. TRAFFIC's Brussels office was investigating the European parrot trade, while also assisting the government with the implementation of its newly signed up commitments to CITES. In 1986 TRAFFIC conducted a successful review of the implementation of the European Union (EU) wildlife trade regulations. The study ultimately led to the establishment of new EU Laws, often considered to be the most comprehensive in the world.
 TRAFFIC continued to grow, establishing 13 more offices worldwide including in Europe (1990), in East/Southern Africa (1991) and in East Asia (1994). TRAFFIC began looking into trade issues including tiger, agarwood and rhino, and established the Bad Ivory Database System (BIDS) which became the foundation for the highly important ETIS.[3] TRAFFIC's first major work in Africa looked into the decline of black rhinos, which assessed the future for rhinos in the face of serious threats from poaching and continued trafficking of horn. In the first global attempt to keep track of all the rhino horn in circulation, TRAFFIC established the Rhino Horn and Product Database. It provided a valuable source of information for government and private sources to regulate rhino horn trade, and has since been expanded to include data from 54 countries. The organisation made headway in tackling the illegal trade of tigers, publishing an influential report reviewing the worldwide trade in tiger bone which was driving down populations for its use in the medicine trade and the production of Wine and other ointments. TRAFFIC hosted a forum involving East Asian stakeholders and the Chinese University of Hong Kong to discuss effective alternatives to the use of Tiger bone in traditional Asian medicine.[4] A joint TRAFFIC/WWF report led to a WWF campaign against the use of tiger bone in medicine.[5]
 TRAFFIC also turned its attention to medicinal plants, carrying out surveys to assess the impact of plant trade in Europe on wild plant populations in 1993, and hosted a symposium on medicinal plants later in the decade, which was attended by more than 120 plant specialists and government and industry representatives.[6] Meanwhile, the TRAFFIC office in India, after revealing that Agarwood was under huge threat from logging and international trade, helped the Indian government to draft a proposal for the species to be regulated under CITES. Its trade is now controlled via a strict system of permits. On the policy side, TRAFFIC was assisting governments with wildlife tracking and enforcement. In 1999 they helped establish the Species Protection Department of the Anti-Corruption Commission in Zambia establish a computerised database to improve understanding of smuggling networks and provided Kenyan authorities with wildlife enforcement training and helped establish a detector dog unit to sniff out wildlife products. TRAFFIC helped draft influential EU wildlife resolutions in 1997. In 1999 TRAFFIC signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with CITES, increasing the potential for further collaboration between the two organisations.[7] In July of the same year TRAFFIC also gained UK charity status.
 The following decade saw increasing collaboration and multifaceted ways to improve enforcement and tackle wildlife crime. TRAFFIC helped establish wildlife sniffer dog units in countries around the world, including the first in South Korea in 2001, following feasibility studies. Since the 2008 establishment of the Wildlife Sniffer Dog unit in India, 43 dog squads have been trained, and the dogs, informally known as ‘Traffic's super sniffers’, have been successful in leading to at least 150 wildlife seizures. TRAFFIC was also instrumental in the use of forensics to tackle wildlife crime, signing an MoU with TRACE (Technologies and Resources for Applied Conservation and Enforcement) in 2007.
 TRAFFIC also began to branch out into what it now refers to as the ‘green stream’, promoting sustainable wildlife trade rather than tackling unsustainable trade. In 2007 TRAFFIC, together with WWF, IUCN and BfN, launched the ISSC-MAP standard for sustainable wild collection of medicinal and aromatic plants.[8] A year later this merged with the FairWild foundation to form the FairWild standard, which promotes and certifies wild products which are harvested in a way which is sustainable both to the environment and to local communities. FairWild, still TRAFFIC's close partner, runs projects around the world which help local communities make income off sustainable wild plant collection, harvesters receiving a premium for their products.
 TRAFFIC began to incorporate more social and economic responsibility into its work, empowering communities whilst promoting sustainable wildlife trade. In 2011 a project was launched working with groups of indigenous women in the Amazon to promote sustainable trade and provide alternative sources of income to the unsustainable harvest of wildmeat. A partnership was set up between TRAFFIC, the Waorani Women's organisation and a high quality chocolate company, WAO chocolate,[9] to fulfil this purpose, winning a UNDP award in June 2014.[10]
 Post 2010, TRAFFIC began to embrace the field of making wildlife trade sustainable through behaviour change. In 2014 TRAFFIC helped launch the Chi Initiative in Vietnam, one of the biggest consumers of rhino horn products, to preserve rapidly depleting rhino populations.[11] Promoting the idea that virtue, masculinity and good luck flowed from within rather than from a piece of horn, they enlisted top businessmen and role model figures. In 2016 TRAFFIC launched the Wildlife Consumer Behaviour Change Toolkit as a communication platform and hub for all those interested in leading their own wildlife behaviour change campaigns.[12]
 In an increasingly globalised era, TRAFFIC has continuously encouraged and been a part of international and intergovernmental collaboration. TRAFFIC supported the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in their creation of Wildlife Enforcement network (ASEAN-WEN) in 2005.[13] In 2017 TRAFFIC paved the way for collaboration between South Africa, the main source country of rhino horn, and Vietnam, the main consumer, for forensically testing of rhino horn to determine the trade routes.[14]
 Meanwhile, the organisation has published a number of reports. In 2001, reports into the decline in Antarctic and Patagonian toothfish due to poor fishing regulations led to boosted efforts to control trade in these species at the next CITES Conference of Parties. A seminal report into wildmeat in the early 2000s paved the way for discussions and a TRAFFIC hosted conference in Yaounde, Cameroon. TRAFFIC won a prestigious award from the Mazda Wildlife Fund in 2007 for its achievements in conservation,[15] while in 2011 a short documentary on the poaching crisis in the Belum-Temengor Forest Complex in Malaysia won the Best Local Film award at the Eco Film Fest.[16]
 
 The Elephant Trade Information system (ETIS) is a comprehensive information system to track illegal trade in ivory and other elephant products, helping with both enforcement efforts and recognition of long term patterns in the ivory trade[17]. Managed by TRAFFIC on behalf of CITES, it contained close to 20,000 records from around 100 countries by 2014, with rigorous analysis which allowed adjustments for inherent biases in the raw data. ETIS originated with TRAFFIC's Bad Ivory Database System (BIDS), set up in 1992 to keep track of all law enforcement records from ivory seizures or confiscations around the world since 1989. This evolved into the more sophisticated ETIS model. Already this seizure data has led to the production of individual country reports for every Party to CITES on two occasions, and in 2012 statistics from ETIS helped inform the CITES decision making process that resulted in a number of Parties being asked to develop National ivory Action Plans to regulate the ivory markets.[18]
 One of TRAFFIC's major achievements was its success in influencing EU wildlife trade regulations, resulting in significant improvement. In 1992 TRAFFIC published The wild plant trade in Europe: Results of a survey of European nurseries, a major study on plant trade which highlighted the need for harmonising legislation within the EU. Off the back of this TRAFFIC worked the next year with WWF to initiate a project to work for improvement in EU wildlife trade regulations. They were finally successful in helping draft the new regulations, which took effect in 1997.[19] Council Regulation (EC) No. 338/97 and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 939/97, informed by TRAFFIC's knowledge of the legality and sustainability of commerce in wild animals and plants, represented some of the most comprehensive wildlife trade legislation in existence to implement CITES and strict new penalties were put in place for illegal wildlife trade.[20]
 TRAFFIC, together with WWF, was instrumental in raising awareness about and reducing the demand for shahtoosh, which comes from the wool of the endangered Tibetan antelope. International trade of this animal product was banned by CITES in 1975 but domestic and illegal trade continued.  In 1997 TRAFFIC provided a tip-off for an important seizure of shahtoosh wool, when 140 shawls were seized in one of Hong Kong's top hotels, which led to the first successful prosecution based on the use of forensic identification techniques.[21] The organisation also launched an awareness campaign with WWF, which gained the support of public figures including supermodel Shalom Harlow, reigning Miss India Gul Panag, world-renowned Indian writer Khushwant Singh in calling for an end to shahtoosh shawls.[22]
 In 2012 TRAFFIC and WWF launched a joint global campaign encouraging governments to combat illegal wildlife trade and reduce demand for illicit endangered species products. It focused especially on those which were under extreme threat from poaching, for instance rhinos, where the number of killings in South Africa had risen from 13 animals (2007) to 448 (2011). As well as leading to action by individual governments, the campaign’s momentum led to the unprecedented success of the first UN resolution on wildlife crime in 2015 (Traffic news story here, resolution here). Drawing global attention to the issue, the resolution tasks the UN secretary general with presenting an annual report on global wildlife crime and countries’ implementation of the resolution, as well as recommendations.
 TRAFFIC was one of the first organisations to draw attention to the unsustainable use of bushmeat or wildmeat in its 2000 study Food For Thought: the utilization of wild meat in eastern and southern Africa. Its findings, including the fact that the previously taboo species zebra was being increasingly harvested, led to widespread publicity including an IUCN report on the subject. TRAFFIC, together with IUCN and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) subsequently organised a workshop in Yaoundé, Cameroon to provide a forum for representatives of the conservation, development, private and government sectors to discuss the issue, which led to the adoption of certain Traffic recommendations.[23]
 TRAFFIC, as a joint initiative with the Belgian Federal Police, Belgian Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Management Authority (CITES MA), and Belgian Customs set up and still help maintain a wildlife database and information exchange platform known as the EU Trade in Wildlife Information Exchange (EU-TWIX).[24] Operational by 2005, it centralises data on seizures submitted by EU enforcement agencies, by 2010 holding over 31,000 seizure records and having an active membership of over 500 law enforcement officers from all EU member states. It has helped with enforcement, with at least 13 criminal investigations being initiated in 2014 as a result of the 500 enforcement-related messages exchanged that year via the platform, and has been used to provide reports.[25][26] In 2010 EU-TWIX gained recognition at a CITES conference as the most functional database on illegal wildlife trade.
 TRAFFIC has since helped establish other systems modelled on EU-TWIX including TigerNet, set up in 2009 by the Indian Government’s National Tiger Conservation Authority, as an official database on mortality and poaching related to tigers,[27] and AFRICA-TWIX, operational in Central African countries since 2016.[28] At the CITES 2010 Conference, the Parties adopted the resolution to create GLOBAL-TWIX, a global seizures database, an expansion of EU-TWIX.
 TRAFFIC exposed unsustainable and illegal logging practices carried out in Tanzania in a 2007 report which pointed out that governance shortfalls in the forestry sector were leading to huge economic losses. The lost revenue each year was enough to build 10,000 new secondary school classrooms or provide a quarter of Tanzanians with mosquito nets. There was swift governmental response to this report, as APNAC met immediately to discuss the findings, whilst the government sent a team of experts to ""beneficiary"" countries including China, India, United Arab Emirates and Singapore, to ask for their help in stopping the illegal logging.[29] By April 2008, recognition of the issues in the report led to the launch of the Mama Misitu campaign, in which seventeen NGOs began to collaborate to tackle corruption and mismanagement in Tanzania’s forestry sector.[30]
 The EU-FLEGT Programme (‘Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade’) aims to reduce illegal logging by strengthening the sustainability and legality of forest management, improving forest governance and promoting trade in legally produced timber.[31] TRAFFIC is implementing this in South America. As part of this, TRAFFIC in 2014 created an international exchange forum, allowing members of the public and private sector, governments, international agencies and indigenous groups to exchange information about logging.[32] It enables the creation of common strategies to tackle the illegal timber trade.
 TRAFFIC has continually worked on tackling trade of endangered tiger products, frequently used for their pelts and bones for traditional Asian medicine.[33] After discovering in 1994, for instance, that over half of stores in America’s Chinatown districts were selling illegal wildlife products, mainly for medicine,[4] TRAFFIC hosted a forum to discuss alternative medicinal ingredients to tiger bone. More recently in 2007 a TRAFFIC study illustrated the dangers to the species from commercial tiger farming in China, which was providing opportunities for the illegal tiger product trade.[34] It led to high level discussion on the issue at the CITES fourteenth Conference of Parties (CoP14) resulting in a calls large scale tiger farms to be closed down.[35]
 
 Recently, TRAFFIC has continued to work on making sure the trade in wild species does not threaten their survival. This involves both tackling the illegal trade in wildlife and promoting the legal and sustainable trade in wildlife products, for instance through the FairWild foundation.
 TRAFFIC is implementing the USAID funded Wildlife-TRAPS project which works in Africa and Asia, global hubs of wildlife trade, to tackle illegal trade between the two continents.[36] Part of this is strengthening the knowledge base and cooperation of governments, intergovernmental organisations and the private sector. In 2016 TRAFFIC organised a workshop on Rhino DNA testing which brought together scientists, enforcement officers and investigators from source, transit and consumer countries.[37]
 TRAFFIC has been working through the ROUTES Partnership to disrupt illegal transportation of all wildlife species on a global level, carrying out research and providing enforcement training. This is a collaborative partnership working with transport industries including airlines. As part of this TRAFFIC has carried out research, encouraged intergovernmental collaboration and helped with enforcement, hosting for instance these concurrent training events in airports in South Africa and Vietnam, two countries inextricably linked in the rhino horn trade.[38]
 TRAFFIC and FairWild have been implementing projects around the world to ensure that threatened plants are collected from the wild in a way which is both environmentally sustainable and economically viable for local collectors. Project LENA works in the Danube region of Eastern Europe to provide sustainable livelihoods for local families including wild plant harvesting. Another FairWild project recently worked in the habitat of the Giant Panda, creating a lasting system to ensure that plant collection will not damage the ecosystem.[39] In 2017, the inaugural FairWild week was launched to raise awareness of this certification scheme.[40]
 TRAFFIC's ongoing work on particular species includes: 
 
 TRAFFIC works with a range of partner organisations and individuals. This includes institutional partners WWF and IUCN, other NGOs, government agencies, inter-governmental organisations such as CITES and the World Customs Organisation and businesses.
 TRAFFIC is also a member of a number of formal partnership initiatives, including:
 TRAFFIC also works closely with CITES, having signed a MoU with them in 1999. Another partner is the FairWild Foundation. TRAFFIC was involved in setting up ISSC-MAP, which merged with the FairWild Foundation to create the FairWild Standard, which certifies the sustainable use of wild-collected ingredients, with a fair deal for all those involved throughout the supply chain.
 TRAFFIC has a range of publications and reports which can be accessed on the TRAFFIC site for example a paper on the Otter Trade in Japan and threatened turtles in Jakarta.[51][52]"
Tulsa Community Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_Community_Foundation	"The Tulsa Community Foundation (TCF) is one of the largest community foundations in the United States.[1][2][3]  Headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as of January 2011 it was reported to have approximately four billion dollars in assets,[4] and to have donated more than $580 million to local charities and government projects.[5]
 Tulsa Community Foundation is a tax-exempt, public charity organized in 1998.  It was founded by Tulsa oilman, banker, and philanthropist George Kaiser, who felt that Tulsa's historical dependence on unorganized private giving from its wealthy families was no longer effective.  Beginning with gifts from seventeen local philanthropists, by 2006 Tulsa Community Foundation had grown to become the largest community foundation in the country, surpassing the New York Community Trust,[6][7] and it remained the largest until 2013, when a $1 billion contribution lifted the Silicon Valley Community Foundation into first place.[8]  Kaiser's family foundation remains the largest contributor to the community foundation, which also manages about 600 donor advised funds.[5]
 In 2005, members of the United States Senate Committee on Finance, and others, criticized the foundation structure of TCF, and other charities, for arguably permitting givers to take tax deductions out of proportion to the actual amounts given for public charity, and for potentially allowing the donors to have effective control of the community foundation.[9]  Because the Tulsa Community Foundation (unlike some private foundations) is not restricted from making gifts to government agencies, it has also drawn occasional comment and criticism for its potential influence on local government.[5]"
UNICEF	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF	"The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), originally known as the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, was created by the United Nations General Assembly on 11 December 1946, to provide emergency food and healthcare to children and mothers in countries that had been devastated by World War II. The Polish physician Ludwik Rajchman is widely regarded as the founder of UNICEF and observed as its first chairman from 1946 to 1950, when he had to flee the United States in the wake of McCarthyism. Rajchman is to this day the only person that served as UNICEF's Chairman for longer than 2 years. On Rajchman's suggestion, the American Maurice Pate was appointed  first executive director, serving from 1947 until his death in 1965.[1][2] In 1950, UNICEF's mandate was extended to address the long-term needs of children and women in developing countries everywhere. In 1953 it became a permanent part of the United Nations System, and the words ""international"" and ""emergency"" were dropped from the organization's name, though it retained the original acronym, ""UNICEF"".[3]
 Funds
 UNICEF relies on contributions from governments and private donors. UNICEF's total income for 2015 was US$5,009,557,471. Governments contribute two-thirds of the organization's resources. Private groups and individuals contribute the rest through national committees. It is estimated that 92 percent of UNICEF revenue is distributed to program services.[4] UNICEF's programs emphasize developing community-level services to promote the health and well-being of children. UNICEF was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965, the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize in 1989 and the Prince of Asturias Award of Concord in 2006.
 OFFICES
 Most of UNICEF's work is in the field, with a presence in 192 countries and territories. UNICEF's network of over 150 country offices, headquarters and other offices, and 34 National Committees carry out UNICEF's mission through programs developed with host governments. Seven regional offices provide technical assistance to country offices as needed.
 UNICEF's Supply Division is based in Copenhagen and serves as the primary point of distribution for such essential items as vaccines, antiretroviral medicines for children and mothers with HIV, nutritional supplements, emergency shelters, family reunification, and educational supplies.[5] A 36-member executive board establishes policies, approves programs and oversees administrative and financial plans. The executive board is made up of government representatives who are elected by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, usually for three-year terms.
 
Each country office carries out UNICEF's mission through a unique program of cooperation developed with the host government. This five-year program focuses on practical ways to realize the rights of children and women. Regional offices guide this work and provide technical assistance to country offices as needed. Overall management and administration of the organization takes place at the headquarters, where global policy on children is shaped. Guiding and monitoring all of UNICEF's work is an Executive Board made up of 36 members who are government representatives. They establish policies, approve programs and decide on administrative and financial plans and budgets. Executive Board's work is coordinated by the Bureau, comprising the President and four Vice-Presidents, each officer representing one of the five regional groups. These five officers, each one representing one of the five regional groups, are elected by the Executive Board each year from among its members, with the presidency rotating among the regional groups on an annual basis. As a matter of custom, permanent members of the Security Council do not serve as officers of the Executive Board. Office of the Secretary of the Executive Board supports and services the Executive Board. It is responsible for maintaining an effective relationship between the Executive Board and the UNICEF secretariat, and helps to organize the field visits of the Executive Board.[6][7][8] The following countries are home to UNICEF Regional Offices.
 1)The Americas and Caribbean Regional Office, Panama City, Panama
2)Europe and Central Asia Regional Office, Geneva, Switzerland
3)East Asia and the Pacific Regional Office, Bangkok, Thailand
4)Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office, Nairobi, Kenya
5)Middle East and North Africa Regional Office, Amman, Jordan
6)South Asia Regional Office, Kathmandu, Nepal
7)West and Central Africa Regional Office, Dakar, Senegal
 There are national committees in 36 [industrialized] countries, each established as an independent local non-governmental organization.  The national committees raise funds from the public sector.
 UNICEF is funded entirely by voluntary contributions,[9] and the National Committees collectively raise around one-third of UNICEF's annual income. This comes through contributions from corporations, civil society organizations around six million individual donors worldwide.
 In the United States, Nepal and some other countries, UNICEF is known for its ""Trick-Or-Treat for UNICEF"" program in which children collect money for UNICEF from the houses they trick-or-treat on Halloween night, sometimes instead of candy.
 UNICEF is present in 191 countries and territories around the world, but not involved in nine others (Bahamas, Brunei, Cyprus, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malta, Mauritius, Monaco, Singapore, and Taiwan).[10]
 Many people in developed countries first hear about UNICEF's work through the activities of one of the 36 National Committees for UNICEF. These non-governmental organizations (NGO) are primarily responsible for fundraising, selling UNICEF greeting cards and products, creating private and public partnerships, advocating for children's rights, and providing other support. The US Fund for UNICEF is the oldest of the national committees, founded in 1947.[11]
 On 19 April 2007, Grand Duchess Maria Teresa of Luxembourg was appointed UNICEF Eminent Advocate for Children,[12] in which role she has visited Brazil (2007),[13] China (2008),[14] and Burundi (2009).[15]
 In 2009, the British retailer Tesco used ""Change for Good"" as advertising, which is trademarked by UNICEF for charity usage but not for commercial or retail use. This prompted the agency to say, ""it is the first time in Unicef's history that a commercial entity has purposely set out to capitalise on one of our campaigns and subsequently damage an income stream which several of our programs for children are dependent on"". They went on to call on the public ""who have children’s welfare at heart, to consider carefully who they support when making consumer choices"".[16][17]
 In 2013 William Armstrong was the first British male to take on the 1,600-kilometre (990 mi) JOGLE solo unaided challenge raising funds and creating a media frenzy at the time.[citation needed] Many ambassadors including Hollywood actor Ewan McGregor were big fans of his quest to promote UNICEF.[citation needed]
 On 7 September 2006, an agreement between UNICEF and the Spanish Catalan association football club FC Barcelona was reached whereby the club would donate €1.5 million per year to the organization for five years. As part of the agreement, FC Barcelona would wear the UNICEF logo on the front of their uniforms in the colour yellow (as seen in the picture on the right of Lionel Messi).[18] This was the first time a football club sponsored an organization rather than the other way around. It was also the first time in FC Barcelona's history that they have had another organization's name across the front of their uniform. In 2016, the team signed a new four-year sponsorship deal with UNICEF guaranteeing the organization £1.58 million per year and free advertising.[19]
 In January 2007 UNICEF struck a partnership with Canada's national tent pegging team. The team was officially re-flagged as ""UNICEF Team Canada"", and its riders wear UNICEF's logo in competition, and team members promote and raise funds for UNICEF's campaign against childhood HIV-AIDS.[20] When the team became the 2008 tent pegging world champions, UNICEF's flag was raised alongside the Canadian flag at the games, the first time in the history of international Grand Prix equestrian competition that a non-state flag has flown over the medal podium.[21]
 The Swedish club Hammarby IF followed the Spanish and Canadian lead on 14 April 2007,[22] also raising funds for UNICEF and displaying the UNICEF name on their sportswear. The Danish football club Brøndby IF participated in a similar arrangement from 2008 to 2013.[23]
 In 2007, Race driver Jacques Villeneuve has occasionally placed the UNICEF logo on the #27 Bill Davis Racing pickup truck in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series.[24]
 Australian A-League club Sydney FC announced they would also enter into a partnership with UNICEF raising funds for children in the Asia-Pacific region, and would also display the UNICEF logo for the remainder of the 2011-12 A-League season.[25]
 In Botswana, UNICEF has funded the development of new state-of-the-art HIV/AIDS education for every schoolchild in Botswana from nonprofit organization TeachAIDS.[26]
 UNICEF announced a landmark partnership with Scottish club Rangers F.C. UNICEF partnered with the Rangers Charity Foundation and pledged to raise £300,000 by 2011.[27]
 In 2010, UNICEF created a partnership with Phi Iota Alpha, making them the first Greek Lettered Organization UNICEF has ever worked with. In 2011, Phi Iota Alpha raised over $20,000 for the Tap Project and the Trick or Treats for UNICEF Campaign.
 In 2013, they agreed a contract with Greek association football champions Olympiacos F.C. who will show the organization's logo on the front of their shirts.
 Started in 2015, Kid Power is a division of UNICEF that was created as an effort to involve kids in helping other kids in need. UNICEF Kid Power developed the world's first Wearable for Good,[28] called Kid Power Bands,[29] which is a kids’ fitness tracker bracelet that connects to a smartphone app. The app lets users complete missions, which counts total steps and awards points. The points then unlock funding from partners, which is then used by UNICEF to deliver lifesaving packets of therapeutic food to severely malnourished children around the world.
 Since 1950, when a group of children in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, donated $17 which they received on Halloween to help post-World War II victims, the Trick-or-Treat UNICEF box has become a tradition in North America during the fall.[30] These small orange boxes are handed to children at schools and other locations before 31 October. As of 2012[update], the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF campaign has collected approximately C$91 million in Canada and over US$167 million in the U.S.[31]
 In 1994, UNICEF held a summit encouraging animation studios around the world to create individual animated spots demonstrating the international rights of children. Cartoons for Children's Rights is the collection of animated shorts based on UNICEF's Convention on the Rights of the Child.
 To raise money to support its Education and Literacy Programs, UNICEF collaborates with companies worldwide – international as well as small- and medium-sized businesses.
 Since 2004, the organization has been supported by Montblanc, working collaboratively to help the world's children getting better access to education.[32]
 According to Vaccine News Daily, Merck & Co. partnered with UNICEF in June 2013 to decrease maternal mortality, HIV and tuberculosis prevalence in South Africa. Merck's program ""Merck for Mothers"" will give US$500 million worldwide for programs that improve health for expectant mothers and their children.[33]
 In May 2010, Crucell N.V. announced an additional US$110 million award from UNICEF to supply its pentavalent pediatric vaccine Quinvaxem to the developing world.[34]
 UNICEF works directly with companies to improve their business practices, bringing them in line with obligations under international law, and ensuring that they respect children's rights in the realms of the marketplace, workplace, and the community. In 2012, UNICEF worked with Save the Children and The United Nations Global Compact to develop the Children's Rights and Business Principles and now these guidelines form the basis UNICEF's advice to companies. UNICEF works with companies seeking to improve their social sustainability by guiding them through a due diligence process where issues throughout their supply chain, such as child labor, can be identified and actions to ratify them are put in place.[35]
 The Girl Star[36] project is a series of films which documents stories of girls from the most disadvantaged communities across five northern states in India who, through via education, have managed to break socio-economic constraints to make a success of their lives and become self-sufficient. These young women have grown to become role models in their communities, inspiring younger girls to go to school and continue their education. They have selected professions from the most conventional such as teaching and nursing, to the most unconventional like archery, bee-keeping, scrap management[clarification needed], often entering what has traditionally been a man's domain.
Girl Star is also one of UNICEF's most known projects.[citation needed]
 Kids United is a French musical group of four children (six children when the group was formed) born between 2000 and 2007. It has been created to support UNICEF campaigns and is sponsored by Hélène Ségara and Corneille, two Francophone singers. The first album Un monde meilleur (A better world) was launched on Universal Children's Day in 2015, it received gold certification in France. The second album Tout le bonheur du monde was even certified 2x platinum.
 U-Report is a free SMS social monitoring tool and real-time information system for community participation, designed to strengthen community-led development, citizen engagement, and positive change. SMS polls and alerts are sent out to U-reporters and real-time response information is collected. Results and ideas are shared back with the community. Issues polled include among others health, education, water, sanitation and hygiene, youth unemployment, HIV/ AIDS, disease outbreaks; social welfare sectors. The initiative is currently operational in 41 countries and covers more than 3 million people.
 On the 19th June 2019 the 2021 Rugby League World Cup (England) announced that Unicef would become the official tournament charity[37][38]. The announcement was made at Mansion House, London[39] as part of a launch event for the Rugby League World Cup legacy program called 'Inspired by RLWC2021'. The partnership aims to use the power of sport to raise awareness and funds for Unicef’s work protecting children in danger around the world.
 In addition to the general promotion of the charity at matches and events, the 2021 Rugby League World Cup Chief Executive has also stated that there will be an officially designated 'Unicef' game at some point during the mens world cup.
 UNICEF Ambassadors are leaders in the entertainment industry, representing the fields of film, television, music, sports and beyond. They help raise awareness of the needs of children, and use their talent and fame to fund-raise, advocate, and educate on behalf of UNICEF.[40]
 The old UNICEF World Warehouse is a large facility in Denmark, which hosts UNICEF deliverable goods as well as co-hosts emergency goods for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). Until 2012 the facilities was a 25,000m2 warehouse at Marmormolen in Copenhagen. With construction of a 45,000m2 UN City that is to house all UN activities in Copenhagen under one roof,[41] the warehouse service has been relocated to outer parts of the Freeport of Copenhagen. The facility houses the UNICEF Supply Division which manages strategic transport hubs in Dubai, Kualalumpur, Panama and Shanghai.[42] The warehouse contains a variety of items, e.g., food supplements, water purification tablets, dietary and vitamin supplements, and the ""School in a box"" (illustrated above).
 The UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre in Florence, Italy, was established in 1988. The centre, formally known as the International Child Development Centres, has as its prime objectives to improve international understanding of issues relating to children's rights, to promote economic policies that advance the cause of children, and to help facilitate the full implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in industrialized and developing countries.
 
The program for 2006–2008 was approved by UNICEF Executive Board in September 2005.  It reaffirms the centre's academic freedom and the focus of IRC's research on knowledge gaps, emerging questions and sensitive issues which are relevant to the realization of children's rights, in developing and industrialized countries. It capitalizes on IRC's role as an interface between UNICEF field experience, international experts, research networks and policy makers and is designed to strengthen the centre's institutional collaboration with regional academic and policy institutions, pursuing the following goals:
 Three interrelated strategies guide the achievement of these goals:
 UNICEF has a policy preferring orphanages only be used as temporary accommodation for children when there is no alternative. UNICEF has historically opposed the creation of large-scale, permanent orphanages for children, preferring instead to find children places in their (extended) families and communities, wherever possible. This has led UNICEF to be skeptical of international adoption efforts as a solution to child care problems in developing countries; UNICEF has preferred to see children cared for in their birth countries rather than be adopted by foreign parents.[44][45]
 A 2015 article in U.S. News & World Report magazine asserted UNICEF's intervention that on giving large cash payments to developing countries can lead to a cessation of international adoptions until all of its recommendations are in place, and have even labeled UNICEF a ""villain"" for the extent of its negative impact on orphans.[46] Elizabeth Bartholet and Paulo Barrozo have written in this context, encouraging adoption protocols to take on a more child-centric viewpoint.[citation needed]
 One concern is that the child mortality rate has not decreased in some areas as rapidly as had been planned, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where in 2013 ""the region still has the highest child mortality rate: 92 deaths per 1000 live births"".[47] and that ""Globally, nearly half of under-five deaths are attributable to undernutrition.""
 In 2005, Richard Horton editor-in-chief of The Lancet, editorialized that ""over 60% of these deaths were and remain preventable"" and that the coverage levels for these interventions are ""appallingly low in the 42 countries that account for 90% of child deaths"".[48]
 Documents released by Edward Snowden in December 2013 showed that ""UNICEF"" was among the surveillance targets of British and American intelligence agencies.[49]"
United Methodist Committee on Relief	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Methodist_Committee_on_Relief	"The United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) is the global humanitarian aid and development organization of the United Methodist Church (UMC). UMCOR is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization operated under the auspices of the General Board of Global Ministries. One hundred percent of donations are directed to an earmarked project or relief effort. Administrative expenses are funded by an annual offering collected by United Methodist churches on UMCOR Sunday.
 UMCOR works through programs that address hunger, poverty, sustainable agriculture, international and domestic emergencies, refugee and immigrant concerns, global health issues, and transitional development. These programs are categorized into three major areas:  Humanitarian Relief / Disaster Response, Sustainable Development and Global Health (in collaboration with UM Global Ministries).
 In response to World War II's devastating effects around the world the 1940 General Conference of the Methodist Church (USA) passed a resolution to form a relief agency. Originally named the Methodist Committee for Overseas Relief (MCOR), it was begun as a temporary organization. MCOR was to ""respond to the vast needs of human suffering worldwide"" by analyzing the most critical needs in the world and relaying these needs to local churches who would in turn provide monetary assistance. From the outset, the agency promoted ecumenical partnership with other denominational relief efforts.
 At the 1972 General Conference the name was changed to UMCOR and was legislated as a permanent entity under the auspices of the United Methodist Church's General Board of Global Ministries (GBGM). As UMCOR grew, the committee began to see the need to streamline its outreach efforts. The five areas of relief were created to encourage a more efficient distribution of aid.
 When UMCOR was first formed, the mission was, ""to provide relief in disaster areas, aiding refugees and confronting the challenge of world hunger and poverty.""[citation needed] Today the agency's mission has changed very little. According to the United Methodist Book of Discipline, UMCOR's current responsibility is ""To provide immediate relief of acute human need and to respond to the suffering of persons in the world caused by natural, ecological, political turmoil, and civil disaster.""[citation needed]
 Unlike most relief organizations, UMCOR was designed so that 100 percent of all donations go directly to the intended projects. This goal was achieved by instituting the One Great Hour of Sharing (OGHS) donation. The OGHS is an annual collection taken at United Methodist churches around the world in March. UMCOR receives enough support through OGHS each year to cover all overhead, administrative, and operation costs for the coming year. Excess funds received from OGHS are directed to UMCOR's most urgent or least funded projects. Every dollar received in response to emergency appeals is spent on direct relief.
 UMCOR's unique structure encourages quick, significant responses. UMCOR represents a branch of the General Board of Global Ministries' Health and Relief Unit. Under this unit, UMCOR enjoys financial stability, organizational accountability, and bureaucratic protection. The organization is led by a board of 18 directors from around the world who oversee operations, develop strategies, and search out opportunities for providing aid. Offices in New York, Washington, DC, and Vienna, Austria, monitor world situations and evaluate how relief can be best distributed. Programs are organized according to their geographical regions: Africa, Europe and Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the United States.
 What makes UMCOR unique is its structure for receiving donations. UMCOR is organized so that when a need arises the committee sends all pertinent information to local churches and organizations worldwide. These churches and organizations then collect donations and send them to distribution centers. By doing this UMCOR is able to receive large donations very quickly and very efficiently, thus reducing overhead and operational costs. UMCOR acts as an information relay point between needs and donations.
 In an effort to streamline relief efforts around the world UMCOR has developed five core areas of relief:  Hunger, Health, Refugees, Emergencies, and Relief Supplies. Each area of relief consists of many projects in different distressed areas of the world.
 Starvation and poverty remain among the largest humanitarian problems in the world. As an aid organization, UMCOR addresses these problems through their World Hunger/Poverty program. This program's main emphasis lies in supplying food to hungry people worldwide. However, the committee believes that food distribution is not the complete answer to the hunger problem.
 Alongside supplying food, UMCOR helps poor countries and regions develop their own food stocks. UMCOR provides seeds, tools, and training to advance agricultural efforts. It also collaborates with the National and World Councils of Churches, Heifer Project International, and Habitat for Humanity. In addition to these efforts, UMCOR is active in educating the public on political issues like trade policies, international debt, and political sanctions which promote worldwide hunger and poverty.
 UMCOR's Hunger actions include Food Security in Southern Africa which helped to develop farming techniques in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Water of Life which built wells in Afghanistan, and Filling in the Gaps in Haiti which provides school lunches for over 16,800 children in Haiti. UMCOR also supports National Hunger Awareness Day (June 3), World Food Day (October 16), and World Fair Trade Day (May 8).
 The second core area of relief that UMCOR provides is Health. UMCOR's health initiative focuses on providing primary health care support, building capacity of health care institutions, offering health education and training, promoting health care, distributing medication, supplies, and equipment, and supporting maternal and pediatric health care.
 One of UMCOR's tools in the fight against disease is the Health Kit. Health Kits consist of a hand towel, a washcloth, a comb, a nail file or fingernail clippers, a bar of soap, a toothbrush, a tube of toothpaste, and six adhesive bandages. These health kits are sent to people who cannot acquire these supplies due to poverty, natural disaster, or other reasons. UMCOR encourages local churches and other groups to compile Health Kits to donate to the agency's mission. UMCOR believes that by individuals assembling these Health Kits that the donator will better understand the need for providing this type of aid.
 Current projects and programs that UMCOR undertakes include HIV/AIDS Programs, Landmine Removal, Hospital Revitalization, and Comprehensive Community-Based Health Primary Care (CCPHC) Programs.
 In this core area, UMCOR provides relief to peoples displaced from their homes due to violence, oppression, and natural disaster. Refugees was one of the first and largest areas to which UMCOR provided relief when the committee was first formed. World War II had caused a great influx of refugees fleeing from the war and the rate never slowed down. Today most of UMCOR's Refugee aid is provided in El Salvador, Guatemala, Liberia, Mozambique, Cuba, Vietnam, and Eastern Europe.
 UMCOR's Refugee aid consists of fulfilling the primary needs of the displaced peoples. Food, shelter, and medicine are among the first supplies distributed. UMCOR also realizes the long-term effects of displacement. After primary needs are filled the agency helps refugees by supporting settlement through finances and labor or aids in planning the return home. UMCOR also provides counseling to refugees after being displaced. Throughout the aid processes UMCOR teams with the National Council of the Churches of Christ (NCCC), Church World Service (CWS), and local ecumenical agencies.
 Refugee core area programs include Justice for Our Neighbors, legal immigration counseling, and support of World Refugee Day (June 20). Most of UMCOR's Refugee projects are need based and cannot be converted to long-term projects.
 UMCOR's goal in emergency response is to ""provide relief and rehabilitation for the entire person – physical, social, and psychological- in a distress situation."" The agency prepares for both immediate and long-term relief efforts after a disaster by stockpiling aid items and keeping a unit of trained ""disaster response specialists"" ready for immediate dispatch. UMCOR pays special attention to the emotional and psychological issues that result from a disaster. A program designed to supply pastor care to children is at the forefront of UMCOR's efforts in this area.
 Most notably UMCOR has recently responded to hurricane disasters in the United States, the December 26, 2004, tsunami in South East Asia, earthquakes in Turkey and Pakistan, political upheaval in Kosovo, famines in Southern and Eastern Africa, and a volcano in the Democratic Republic of Congo. UMCOR also responds to many other smaller disasters which occur, on average, once or more a week.
 In January 2010, UMCOR executive director Samuel W. Dixon Jr. died in the collapse of the Hotel Montana in Haiti. Dixon was part of a group of six UMCOR missionaries and relief specialists caught up in the massive earthquake. The delegation was making plans for improving medical services in Haiti. The minister Clinton C. Rabb also died in the collapse.[1][2]
 The final core area of UMCOR's relief efforts is known as Relief Supplies. This area is supplementary to the other four areas in that it receives and assembles various kits which are then directed to other core areas. For example, the Health Kits mentioned above are received, assembled, packaged, and then distributed under the Health core area. Relief Supplies encourages volunteer support in assembling and distributing the kits so that volunteers can become more connected to the actions of UMCOR.
 Relief Supplies formulated six different kits that are sent around the world. Bedding Kits consist of two bed sheets, two pillow cases, and two pillows. Cleaning Buckets contain 17 different items to assist people in cleaning after a flood or hurricane. Health Kits, as described above, provide hygiene supplies to areas where basic sanitary items are unaffordable or unavailable. Layette kits are made of diapers, baby clothing, and blankets which are designed to meet the basic non-medical supplies needed directly after childbirth. School Kits are assembled with scissors, paper, a ruler, pencil sharpener, pencils, crayons and an eraser. They are designed to promote learning in areas where educational buildings and supplies are scarce or nonexistent. The final kit that Relief Supplies creates and distributes is the Sewing Kit. Sewing Kits provide recipients with three yards of fabric, scissors, needles, threads, and buttons. Sewing kits are intended to help people learn to create their own clothing instead of simply supplying garments. This kit also promotes cultural preservation by allowing recipients to sew clothing in their own cultural styles. Kit contents change periodically.

United Nations Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Foundation	"The United Nations Foundation was launched in 1998 with a $1 billion gift from Ted Turner to support the United Nations causes. The creation of the Foundation was intended to encourage other donors to also support the UN in its activities.[2] The main issue areas that the Foundation addresses are child health, climate change and energy, sustainable development, technology, women, girls, and population, and supporting the United Nations.[3] Some of the biggest global campaigns that the UN Foundation has been involved in include Nothing But Nets, the Measles & Rubella Initiative, the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, Girl Up, Shot@Life,  the Digital Impact Alliance, and the Better World Campaign, among others.
 United Nations Foundation's original purpose was to build support for United Nations causes and to make sure that the United States honors its commitments to the United Nations. Since its beginning, the United Nations Foundation and the Better World Campaign have provided grants in order to support the UN goals worldwide. The United Nations Foundation serves as the largest source of private funding to the United Nations.[4] In conjunction with the UN, they established the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships to serve as the UN counterpart to the Foundation.[5]
 The United Nations Foundation has collected more than $1.2 billion from other sources, including from other foundations, corporations, NGOs, and individuals. The Foundation also works with UN partners in order to provide policy recommendations and project proposals. The Foundation and its sister organization, The Better World Campaign, have helped raise awareness of and support for the UN among global policy makers and the public.[4] The UN Foundation's current budgetary breakdown is $115.7 million going to program services, $7.3 million to fundraising, and $11.8 million going to management and overhead.[6]
 Ted Turner, who in 1996 was worth $3.2 billion due to his shares in Time Warner (who had bought Turner Broadcasting System that year), decided to make a $1 billion contribution to the UN because he had previously donated to similar causes, and felt strongly about the issues the UN were participating in. Before donating to the UN, Turner was a proponent for the protection of the environment, especially in combating global warming. Turner believed that his $100 million per year donation over the course of 10 years would make a difference in the direction of the United Nations, and that he could use this donation to encourage other wealthy members of society to make financial contributions to the work of the UN.[7] By giving away nearly a third of his wealth while still living, Ted Turner was a major influence in the Giving Pledge movement.
 The UN Foundation is led by President and chief executive officer Kathy Calvin. She previously served as the President of AOL Time Warner prior to becoming the CEO of the UN Foundation.[8] Timothy E. Wirth, a former United States Congressman, U.S. Senator, and the first Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs in U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration, previously served as the Foundation's President from 1998 to 2013.[3] Ted Turner serves as the chairman of the board. Aaron Sherinian is the current chief communications officer and spokesman of the UN Foundation.[9] Other notable board members include Queen Rania Al-Abdullah of Jordan, Founder and Chairman Emeritus Infosys N. R. Narayana Murthy, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former US Ambassador to the UN and Mayor of Atlanta Andrew Young, Gro Harlem Brundtland, and Muhammad Yunus among others.[10]
 When the UN Foundation started, it desired to assist the UN with a wide variety of issues, and bring attention to particular modern problems. The Foundation wished to help then Secretary-General Kofi Annan with the problem of reforming the UN. They also desired to bolster UN programs that were viewed as successful, including children's health, population control, environment issues, and land-mines. One of their priorities was also to work with the private sector to raise more money for the UN. They also had the intention of raising awareness of the UN and its programs amongst the American population. They have had a close relationship with the UN and its leadership from the beginning in order to set goals and provide funding for particular programs.[11]
 One of the global issues that the UN Foundation focuses on is women and children's health. They work closely with private sector partners and UN agencies in order to address a variety of children's health issues. One of their biggest campaigns is working to reduce the number of deaths from measles. The Measles & Rubella Initiative, as it called, is a partnership between the UN Foundation, the American Red Cross, UNICEF, the Centers for Disease Control, and the World Health Organization in order to provide measles vaccinations to children across the African continent. During the first year of this campaign, vaccines were distributed across 8 African countries, which vaccinated over 21 million children. This campaign not only focuses on vaccinating children, but also putting into place health infrastructure, and promoting better access to health-care across the continent.[12] In ten years, the Measles Initiative has protected more than 1 billion children from measles.
 The UN Foundation also runs the Nothing But Nets Campaign, which is targeted at reducing malaria across the African continent. This campaign originally started when Sports Illustrated writer Patrick Reilley published an article asking his readers to donate money to a campaign to buy mosquito nets for those in Africa suffering from malaria. With support from the UN Foundation, Reilley's project got off the ground, and has to-date provided over 7 million nets across Africa.[13]
 The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is a partnership that includes the UN Foundation, Rotary International, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, UNICEF, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. The initiative is dedicated to globally eradicating polio through vaccinations and has protected 2 billion children from polio.
 The mHealth Alliance was formed by the UN Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Vodafone Foundation to facilitate global innovation and ensure maximum impact in the field of mobile health (mHealth). The Alliance acts as an umbrella organization to complement, draw together and expand upon the mHealth initiatives of multiple organizations around the world to address global health needs. Since 2006, the UN Foundation-Vodafone Foundation Technology Partnership has been working with the World Health Organization, DataDyne.org and country Ministries of Health to support the development of a sustainable and scalable technology solution to quickly collect vital health data.
 The UN Foundation's Shot@Life campaign educates, connects and empowers Americans to champion vaccines as one of the most cost-effective ways to save the lives of children in developing countries.  The campaign encourages Americans to learn about, advocate for, and donate vaccines to decrease vaccine-preventable childhood deaths.
 Every Woman Every Child was launched by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon during the United Nations Millennium Development Goals Summit in 2010 and aims to save the lives of 16 million women and children 2015. It is a global effort to mobilize and intensify international and national action by governments, multilaterals, the private sector and civil society to address major health challenges facing women and children around the world.
 One of the largest global issues that the UN Foundation is involved in is climate change and energy. The UN Foundation priorities include tackling the global climate challenge, improving energy efficiency and achieving universal energy access. The Foundation's Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Program works with partners in the NGO sector, the UN, governments, and private corporations to come up with solutions and provide funding to programs related to this issue. One of their campaigns in relation to climate change and energy is to provide communities around the world with renewable energy technologies in order to promote sustainability globally.[14]
 The Sustainable Energy for All Initiative calls for private sector and national commitments and attracts global attention to the importance of energy for development and poverty alleviation. The initiative has been called for by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and, as part of the initiative, the UN Foundation has launched a global Energy Access Practitioner Network. The Network aims to bring together practitioners from the private sector and civil society working on the delivery of energy services and solutions related to electrification in a range of developing country contexts to develop a more integrated approach to energy access planning and execution.
 The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is an initiative led by the UN Foundation and supports large-scale adoption of clean and safe household cooking solutions as a way to save lives, improve livelihoods, empower women, and reduce climate change missions. The alliance works with public, private, and non-profit partners to overcome market barriers that hamper the production, deployment, and use of clean cookstoves and fuels in the developing world. It works to develop standards for cleaner stoves, increase public and policymaker awareness of the health and environmental benefits of improved stoves.
 The UN Foundation's International Bioenergy and Sustainability Initiative advances environmentally and economically sustainable strategies for harnessing biomass energy in ways that minimize competition with food products. The initiatives seeks to identify, share and promote best practices for the sustainable use of bioenergy with government leaders, UN agencies, scientific experts, and nongovernmental organizations.
 The UN Foundation launched the campaign Girl Up in September 2010.  This ""for girls, by girls"" campaign channels the energy and enthusiasm of American girls into a powerful force for change for girls globally. Through Girl Up's support, girls in developing countries have the opportunity to become educated, healthy, safe, counted, and positioned to be the next generation of leaders. High school girls are usually the ones to start a branch of the nonprofit organization of Girl Up. Once the clubs at a high school level are created, girls of that high school plan events to raise money and awareness for the importance of women's education. Recently, in the summer of 2015 a book guide for campus level clubs of Girl Up was created so that more money can be raised. Once the money is raised it is sent to the United Nations, who then send it out to the girls in countries that they support; including Guatemala, Malawi, Ethiopia, Liberia and Rajasthan, India.[15]
 The Universal Access Project works to achieve universal access to reproductive health care leading to healthier women, stronger families, and more stable, prosperous communities. Its goal is to increase and maintain the U.S. involvement and support for global family planning by protecting key investments. The UN Foundation is committed to achieving universal access to reproductive health care by 2015 which is also a Millennium Development Goal target.[16]
 The UN Foundation has an extremely close relationship with the UN, as it provides it with large amounts of money to fund programs. The UN Foundation, through its sponsorship and funding of the Better World Campaign, works to better the relationship between the United States and the United Nations. The Better World Campaign advocates at Congress in order to ensure that the US fulfills its financial obligations to the United Nations, and that it repays its debt. The Better World Campaign allows the Foundation to have a direct channel to the US legislative and administrative powers.[17] The UN Foundation also works with the UN to develop new websites, create the UN Radio Service, engage online media outlets and share the UN's point of view through blogs to highlight UN peacekeeping, UN reform, climate change, HIV/AIDS and women's empowerment.
 In 2011, the United Nations Foundation established the Global Entrepreneurs Council, to consist of up to 10 entrepreneurs under the age of 45, who work with the UN to address global issues. Members have been primarily business leaders, but philanthropists and government officials have also served.[18]"
United States Artists	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Artists	"United States Artists (USA) is an independent nonprofit and nongovernmental philanthropic organization based in Chicago and dedicated to supporting the work of living American artists by the granting of cash awards, called USA Fellowships.[5] It was founded in 2005 with initial funding from the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, The Prudential Foundation, and the Rasmuson Foundation, and the first set of 50 fellowships were announced in 2006.[6] The organization is governed by a Board of Directors and receives additional funding from several major American foundations, corporate partners, and private citizens.
 The organization's stated mission is ""to invest in America's finest artists and illuminate the value of artists to society.""[7] In addition, the organization asserts that ""USA Fellowships honor and award an artist’s unique vision as a whole rather than funding a particular project. Artists at different career levels, from emerging to established, are eligible.""[8]
 Prerequisites for consideration include that the artist be 21 or older, a US citizen or legal resident. In addition, nominees must be accomplished artists, must have acquired art training, formal or informal, must have tried to derive income from those skills, and must have been ""actively engaged in creating artwork and presenting it to the public."" To be considered for a grant, an artist must first be nominated by at least one of a group of ""nominators"" chosen by the organization. This is an anonymous group of arts scholars, critics, and artists from various disciplines; they operate independently of one another. The nominators submit names of artists they believe should be considered for an award.[8]
 Once nominated artists have been notified of their nomination, they are then directed to apply for the grant in order to be considered. The awards are announced once a year. The Fellows announcement is made in December of each year.
 Grants are awarded annually to artists working in nine disciplines:

United Way Worldwide	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Way_Worldwide	"United Way Worldwide is an international umbrella organization that hosts thousands of non-profit organizations (often referred to as United Ways). It is the overarching organizational structure in charge of approximately 1,800 community-based United Ways in 45 countries and territories. Subdivisions include the United Way of America in the United States. Charities under the United Way structure organize volunteers and charitable donations to help local communities.
 The United Way concept was founded in Denver, Colorado in 1887. In the mid 1900s local United Ways founded a national organization, later called United Way of America. In 1928, a Community Chest organization was established in Cape Town, South Africa — the first United Way outside North America.[1] By 1974, there were enough United Way organizations internationally to demand the kind of support provided by the national organization, United Way of America, and United Way International was born. Its staff spoke eight languages, with a Board of Directors from more than seven countries, working with member organizations in 45 countries and territories outside the US.
 In May 2009, United Way of America and United Way International were integrated as one global entity, United Way Worldwide.
 There is a significant history of misappropriation of funds and false accounting at United Way, with several high-profile frauds by high-ranking officials leading in part to the collapse of United Way of America and the organisation's rebirth as United Way Worldwide [1]. William Aramony, a founder of United Way, was himself jailed for theft of funds [2].
 In its first 100 years, the United Way network reached 20 countries. Since 1990, United Ways have been created in 25 additional countries.
 United Ways worldwide are led by local volunteers and professional leadership. In communities around the world, the United Way model is to convene local leaders to identify needs and create strategies that allow individuals and families to experience economic and human success through educational achievement, income stability and healthy lives. The historical business model up until 2008 was to provide, assist or promote:
 As of 2017, the United Way network spans 43 countries and territories.[3]
 United Way Tocqueville (UWT) was created in France in 2008 as a non-profit organization, and forms part of the largest private charitable organization in the world, United Way Worldwide. UWT's ambition is to gather together the economic, political and social leaders to initiate collective community efforts to solve social problems.
 United Way France mobilizes corporates, volunteers and public institutions around education programs for junior-high school students. Their main actions include:
 United Way France and the Airbus Corporate Foundation  launched in 2011 the Flying Challenge Program to support and inspire youth.

Airbus employees and college students tutor middle school and high school students, in order to help them succeed at school and develop their awareness of the importance of their orientation choices and potential career.
 United Way New Zealand (UWNZ), officially known as United Way (NZ) Inc., was established in 1975 as the United Way of Greater Auckland. In 1998, the geographic scope of the organization was expanded, and the name was changed to reflect the new national focus.
 United Way's local organization in Chile, along with other United Way organizations throughout Latin America have mobilized to respond to the earthquake that hit Chile on February 27, 2010. They provided support in areas with the most pressing long-term recovery needs.[citation needed]
 United Way Worldwide established the United Way Worldwide Disaster Fund,[4] introduced a text-to-give program, and is coordinating the integration of efforts from United Ways around the world. United Way Worldwide has worked with the United States government – the White House, Congress, State Department, Department of Homeland Security, and to underscore the vital role of U.S. and international NGOs in Haiti's long-term recovery.[5]
 Immediately following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan, United Way began raising crucial funds needed for the Central Community Chest of Japan, part of the United Way worldwide network. Almost 90 volunteer centers have been set up throughout the country at the prefectural, municipal, district, and community levels. As of March 22, eight consultants and 23 volunteer coordinators have been dispatched to Fukushima, Miyagi, Iwate, and Aomori Prefecture, with another 68 coordinators preparing for dispatch. The Central Community Chest of Japan has helped provide supplies to volunteer centers including: bicycles, mattresses, cell phones, and laptops. Additional supplies requested by the volunteer centers include motorbikes, prefab houses and tents, copy and fax machines, PCs and printers.
 The Central Community Chest of Japan is collaborating with 43 affiliated non-profit organizations through the Council for Disaster Relief Project for Volunteers. This number is expected to grow rapidly as transportation conditions continue to improve.[6]"
Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Health_Care_Foundation_of_Connecticut	"Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut is an independent, nonprofit organization[2] with offices in Meriden, Connecticut.[3] The foundation supports the mission of its parent organization, CHART (Connecticut Health Advancement and Research Trust). The foundation has assets of approximately $30 million.[4]
 The foundation has several ideas for universal health care that it believes can be enacted and be affordable for government, consumers and businesses. The organization insists on certain benchmarks: universality, affordability for families and individuals, high quality care, and the ability to continue health care coverage through changing circumstances.[5] The foundation says it believes health care is a fundamental right.[6]
 In 1997, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Comptroller Nancy Wyman and a coalition of advocacy and labor organizations sued the for-profit Anthem Insurance Co. over its merger with the non-profit Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Connecticut.  The aim was to recover tax benefits and other concessions that the former Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Connecticut had received over several decades. The lawsuit was dropped after Anthem Insurance agreed to a settlement in 1999. As a result, the state established the Connecticut Health Advancement and Research Trust. Anthem Foundation of Connecticut was incorporated as a supporting organization to CHART.[7]
 It is one of about 165 foundations nationwide to be created by conversions of nonprofit health corporations to for-profit entities. As a condition of these conversions, the law requires that the assets of the nonprofit be retained for some public purpose.[4]
 At the time, Attorney General Blumenthal called the agreement ""a historic victory"". The foundation received $41 million to carry out the conditions of the settlement. It was charged with working toward system-wide health care reform.[8] The agreement established Anthem Foundation's legal obligation to help improve health care for those who need it most.[9] The foundation was incorporated in 2000. It opened its first offices in New Haven, Connecticut. In January   2003, Juan Figueroa, a former community organizer, former Connecticut legislator, former assistant attorney general of Connecticut and former president and general counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York,[10] became foundation president. In 2004, the foundation changed its name to reflect a final separation from the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut. At the time, Figueroa stated that no relationship with Anthem existed and that the foundation's main focus was passage of universal health care.[11]
 Since 2004, the foundation has awarded over $7 million in grants to organizations to advance that goal.[12]
 In 2007, the Hartford Business Journal chose Juan Figueroa as a 2007 ""Health Care Hero"".[13]
 Since 2005, the foundation has developed relationships with several key groups that would be instrumental in creating broad change in the health system, including medical societies, hospitals, businesses, labor and clergy.[14]
 In January 2009 the foundation unveiled SustiNet, a proposal for a statewide health care plan for Connecticut that would provide residents with their choice of health coverage and care regardless of their employment status, age, or pre-existing conditions.[15]  An estimated 1,000 people attended a rally at Union Station (Hartford) for the release of the plan.[16]
 SustiNet would emphasize preventive care and the management of chronic illnesses.  It would create a large health insurance pool by combining state employees, retirees, and people covered by state assistance programs.  The pool would also be open to members of the public without insurance, those with inadequate insurance, and employers, starting with small businesses, nonprofits and municipalities.  Eventually, Sustinet would be open to larger employers wishing to insure their employees through the plan.
 According to analysis by the nation's leading health economists, SustiNet would reduce the proportion of state residents without health coverage from 12 percent to 2 percent by 2014. In addition, SustiNet would bring about savings in the private sector which would far exceed additional state government expenditures.[17]
 In February, the 18,500-member Connecticut Association of Realtors announced its support for the SustiNet health care plan, explaining that as self-employed individuals, realtors bear the total cost of their insurance premiums, and consequently many are priced out of the market.[18] In addition, the independent statewide organization Small Businesses for Health Care Reform endorsed the proposal and encouraged other business owners to review and support it.[19]
 In March, the foundation's plan was formally endorsed by the Interfaith Fellowship for Universal Health Care, a group devoted to health reform, and by dozens of other religious leaders representing a wide range of faiths in Connecticut. Fellowship members include Rabbi Stephen Fuchs of Congregation Beth Israel in West Hartford, a co-chairman of the Interfaith Fellowship, and Bilal Ansari, a Muslim chaplain at Saint Francis Hospital & Medical Center in Hartford, where much of his counseling involves helping families cope with not just the stress of a relative's illness, but the worries about how they will pay for it.[20]
 SustiNet passed its first hurdle in the General Assembly's joint committees on Thursday, March 26, receiving a favorable report from the Public Health Committee, which voted 22-8 to move the bill forward.[21]  Successively, others did likewise: the Human Services Committee, 13-6 on April 22,[22] Labor and Public Employees Committee, 8-3 on the 29th,[23] and Insurance and Real Estate, 13-4 on May 7.[24]
 On May 20, 2009, the House of Representatives voted 107-35 for SustiNet,[25] and on the 30th, the Senate did the same, 23-12.[26]
 SustiNet was sent to Governor M. Jodi Rell, who vetoed it on July 8.[27]
 On July 20 the governor's vetoes were overridden by the Connecticut House of Representatives with a vote of 102 to 40 and then by the Connecticut Senate with a vote of 24-12.[28]
 The SustiNet law establishes a nine-member board to recommend to the legislature, by January 1, 2011, the details of and implementation process for a self-insured health care plan called SustiNet. The recommendations must address (1) the phased-in offering of the plan to state employees and retirees, HUSKY A and B beneficiaries, people without employer-sponsored insurance or with unaffordable, small and large employers, and others; (2) establishing an entity that can contract with insurers and health care providers, set reimbursement rates, develop medical homes for patients, and encourage the use of health information technology; (3) a model benefits package; and (4) public outreach and ways to identify uninsured citizens.[29]
 The board must establish committees to make recommendations to it about health information technology, medical homes, clinical care and safety guidelines, and preventive care and improved health outcomes. The act also establishes an independent information clearinghouse to inform employers, consumers, and the public about SustiNet and private health care plans and creates task forces to address obesity, tobacco usage, and health care workforce issues. The effective date of the SustiNet law was July 1, 2009 for most provisions.[29]
 The work of the nine member SustiNet board began in July 2009 and in September two more position were added to the board. The now 11 member board will guide four committees and three task forces, which will report to the General Assembly in July 2010. Enrollment in the program will begin in July 2012.[30]"
Vancouver Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Foundation	"The Vancouver Foundation is an organization based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It administers over 1,600 funds and assets totalling $930 million, on behalf of individuals, families, corporations and charities.
 Vancouver Foundation was founded in 1943[1] by Alice MacKay. MacKay had saved $1,000 from her secretarial job and wanted to help homeless women trapped in a cycle of poverty.[citation needed]
 Whitford Julian VanDusen oversaw the establishment and incorporation of Vancouver Foundation.[citation needed] VanDusen added $10,000 to the endowment and encouraged nine friends to match his own gift. In 1950, the Foundation was incorporated by the Legislature of British Columbia in a Special Act.[2]
 Vancouver Foundation, in partnership with its donors, has distributed more than $1 billion to community projects and programs.[1] In 2014, Vancouver Foundation and its donors made more than 4,900 grants, and distributions totalling approximately $57 million, to registered charities across Canada.[citation needed]
 About 70 percent of grant amounts are received within the Lower Mainland region with the remainder in other parts of the province of British Columbia.[3]
 Grant recipients range from social services to medical research groups, to organizations devoted to arts and culture, the environment, education, children and families, youth, and animal welfare.[4]

Varkey Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varkey_Foundation	"The Varkey Foundation, initially the Varkey GEMS Foundation, is a global charitable foundation focused on improving the standards of education for underprivileged children.[2] It was formed in 2010 by Indian businessman Sunny Varkey, the founder and chairman of GEMS Education, the world's largest operator of kindergarten-to-grade-12 schools.[3] The foundation's main focuses are improving global teacher capacity by training tens of thousands of teachers and principals in developing countries; providing access to education via a variety of programmes and projects; and advocating for change in, and conducting research that can help develop, education policies worldwide.[1][4]
 The Varkey Foundation has partnered with a variety of major global organizations including UNESCO, UNICEF, and the Clinton Global Initiative. In 2013 it launched the Global Education and Skills Forum, an annual education summit dedicated to addressing the world's educational needs. After analyzing the public status of teachers worldwide, in 2014 it launched the annual Global Teacher Prize, a $1 million award to an outstanding pioneering teacher who has had a widespread impact.
 The foundation was formed by Sunny Varkey in 2010 as the strategic philanthropic arm of GEMS Education, and was initially called the Varkey GEMS Foundation. Its stated intention is to impact 100 impoverished children for every child enrolled at GEMS schools, or 10 million children globally, via projects such as enrollment and education-access initiatives, worldwide teacher-training programs, advocacy campaigns, policy input through strategic partnerships, and physical projects such as building classrooms, schools, and learning centers.[5][6][7] Bill Clinton launched the foundation.[5][8]
 Beginning in 2013, the foundation's Teacher Training Programme committed to train 250,000 teachers within 10 years in under-served communities across the world.[9][10] The programme began in Uganda in May 2013, and consists of a low-cost, five-day training which the recipients then cascade by training further teachers in their country.[4][9][11] In its first year the programme trained 6,000 teachers in Uganda,[12] and by mid 2015 it had reached 12,000 teachers.[13]  The program is broadening to other developing countries in Africa and elsewhere.[11][12][14]
 The teacher training programme moves lessons away from focusing on students' ability to remember and repeat facts; instead, it focuses on encouraging students to apply, analyse, and create based on what they remember. The programme trains teachers to create a culture of personalised learning, with greater student participation, cooperative learning activities, and exploration of ideas. Rather than simply relying on ""chalk and talk"" methods of standing at the front of the classroom, teachers are taught to interact with students, and to accommodate different learning needs – including those of pupils who learn best through visual, auditory, or kinesthetic methods.[11][15][16][17][18]
 In 2013, the foundation launched the annual Global Education and Skills Forum,[19] in partnership with UNESCO and the UAE Ministry of Education.[20] Bill Clinton gave the inaugural keynote address at the 2013 summit.[21]
 The annual conference, which meets in Dubai in March each year, focuses on addressing the world’s educational needs, including how to achieve education for the hundreds of millions of uneducated or under-educated children in the developing world. The event is attended by hundreds of delegates from 35 to 50 countries, and speakers and participants include education ministers, current and former heads of state, business leaders, academics, and representatives of governments and NGOs.[11][22][23] The forum also aims to increase the importance of global education issues in the concerns of large-scale philanthropy, international aid, and businesses.[24]
 In October 2013, the foundation published the Global Teacher Status Index,[25] a 53-page study on the public and social status of teachers in 21 countries around the world. The Indian subcontinent and sub-Saharan Africa were not included in the survey.[26][27] In-depth opinion polling was done by Populus Ltd, and 1,000 respondents were polled in each country.[28] Half a million data points were collected regarding what the general public thinks about the teaching profession and teachers,[11] and the study examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay, and the desirability of teaching as a career.[27]
 Teacher status in the public eye was found to be highest in China, Greece, and Turkey, and lowest in Israel and Brazil. The U.S. and UK were in the middle.[28] Only in China were teachers regarded as having the same status as doctors.[11] In the UK and most other countries, teachers were most likely to be compared to social workers,[28][29][30] whereas in the U.S., Brazil, France, and Turkey teachers were regarded as most similar to librarians, and therefore were viewed as less interactive with students.[28][31] Parents in countries with a higher respect for teachers were more likely to encourage their children to become teachers.[28] In many countries – including Japan, Brazil, Germany, France, and Italy – between one third and one half of parents would not encourage their children to enter the teaching profession.[32]
 In order to raise the status of teaching, at the second annual Global Education and Skills Forum in March 2014, the foundation launched the Global Teacher Prize, an annual $1 million award to an exceptional teacher who has made an outstanding contribution to the profession.[33]
 In 2014 the Varkey Foundation, together with UNESCO, co-created Business Backs Education, a global advocacy campaign that encourages businesses, companies, and corporations to support education to the same degree that they support other basic services such as healthcare.[34][35][36] Bill Clinton co-launched the initiative,[36] which was launched in March 2014 at the second annual Global Education and Skills Forum,[37] and BBE held its New York Summit at the September 2014 annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative.[38][39]
 On the grounds that skills shortages negatively impact companies' ability to prosper and innovate, and inequalities in educational opportunity also weaken the social and political stability needed for businesses to thrive, the BBE campaign recommends that companies worldwide allocate at least 20% of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending to educational initiatives by the year 2020.[11][37][39]
 In January 2015 the campaign published a report, Business Backs Education,[36] analyzing the charitable education donations of the global top 500 companies, recommending that education be a higher priority for corporate social responsibility spending.[40] The study revealed that the Fortune Global 500 companies spend an average of only 13% of their CSR budget on education-related activities, and less than half of the Fortune Global 500 spend any funds on education-related CSR.[41][42][43]
 In Ghana, the Varkey Foundation implements MGCubed – Making Ghana Girls Great[44] – which equips two classrooms in each Ghanaian primary school with a computer, projector, satellite modem, and solar panels, creating an interactive distance-learning platform to deliver both formal in-school teaching and informal after-school training.[45][46][47][48] The project, funded by the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), teaches 8,000 students in 72 Ghanaian schools, and is Sub-Saharan Africa's first interactive distance-learning project.[49] The program, which was  founded by GEMS Education Solutions in 2014, aims to prevent dropping out and under-achieving among girls. Students participate more in these classes, in contrast to the standard system of learning by rote, and the video system also cuts down on teacher absenteeism.[50] Each week, the project also brings in a role model – a successful Ghanaian woman – to speak to the students nationwide.[1][51]
 The Varkey Foundation engages in a variety of projects and programs worldwide. Some of these additional projects include supporting the UNICEF Schools for Asia programme in the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, India, Nepal, and Vietnam;[52][53] supporting the professional development of teachers in Palestine and providing pre-school education in Palestine camps;[54] and establishing Learning Resource Centres in India.[55][56]
 The foundation has also rebuilt damaged and destroyed schools in areas including Kenya and Pakistan;[57] provided clean water and toilets in 25 schools in Tanzania; and provided schools meals to improve access to education in India [56][58]
 Some of the Varkey Foundation's partners and grantees include UNESCO, UNICEF, the Clinton Global Initiative, Oxfam, Pratham, Dubai Cares, and the Brookings Institution.[59][60][61] The Varkey Foundation also offers strategic input and consultancy to NGO partners, including a special emphasis on campaigning on issues to increase the capacity of education systems in the developing world.[62]
 Sunny Varkey is the founder and chairman of the Varkey Foundation. The foundation's trustees are Sunny Varkey and his sons Dino and Jay Varkey.[63]
 The foundation's chief executive officer is Vikas Pota, who was named a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader in 2013, and was elected to the  Fellowship of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce in 2014.[64] He is the author of India Inc: How India's Top Ten Entrepreneurs Are Winning Globally.[64] He also serves on several global education panels and advisory boards – including, for UNESCO, the Girls & Female Education Panel, the Teachers Task Force, and the Global Alliance of Corporate Partners for Education.[64]
 The global advisory board of the Varkey Foundation includes Andreas Schleicher, director for education and skills and special advisor on education policy to the secretary-general at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD); Bertie Ahern, former prime minister of Ireland; Aliko Dangote, founder of the Dangote Group; Nizan Guanaes, chairman of Grupo ABC; Lim Hwee Hua, executive director of Tembusu Partners and former Singaporean MP; and V Shankar, chief executive officer of Europe, Middle East, Africa and Americas at Standard Chartered.[65]"
Veniños	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veni%C3%B1os	"Veniños (Venezuelan Children in Need), is a UK registered charity, dedicated to improving the lives of street and shanty town children in urban Venezuela. It has no religious or political affiliation. The funds raised by Veniños are used to support projects run by well respected non-governmental organisations operating in Venezuela"".[1]
 Veniños was founded by a couple of British citizens who lived in Venezuela for some years. During that time they each witnessed, first hand, some of the reality of disadvantaged children's lives. With experience of NGO organisations working to overcome the difficulties of lives based in poverty, these ladies after moving back to the UK wanted to keep helping such worthwhile projects, and so looked to formalise their efforts by creating a new charity.
 Lisa Tylee, one of Veniños founders, lived in Venezuela and says of her experience, “having worked with street and shanty town children in Caracas, I know that young people need our support and our understanding to help them improve their lives... so I hope that by raising awareness here, as well as funds, we can help these children.”
 From 2003, Trustees and Volunteers have put together time and effort to build the charity, to support a series of projects that are closely monitored and that are designed to make a positive impact on the lives of children living in poverty in Venezuela.
 In Venezuelan neighbourhoods such as “Los Samanes” or “Los Rosales”, Veniños has worked with communities and local charity groups to develop sustainable educational and sport projects. Through supporting local teachers, childcare centres and sponsoring sport clubs, these initiatives bring more opportunities and a better standard of life to children and young people.
 In another project, Veniños have helped Hogar Bambi -a child care centre - to fund a lawyer to provide children with identity papers. This problem has been a common one in Venezuela and not having official papers delays the child's access to the education system. You can find more information about Veniños work in Veniños Newsletters or on their Projects’ page [2] Further information about Hogar Bambi can be found their web site [3]
 With Volunteer groups in different cities, many people have pooled their talents to help the Veniños cause and make a difference to lives in Venezuela. Initiatives have come from various areas: running marathons and organising music concerts in London, auctioning paintings in Nottingham, hosting Salsa parties in Aberdeen or walking great distances from Cornwall to Scotland, Venezuelans and people from different countries have found a way to give their time and effort for a good cause. For the last 5 years, Veniños supporters have been involved with a series of larger fundraising events, such as:"
Vietnam Children's Fund	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Children%27s_Fund	"Vietnam Children's Fund (VCF) is a non-profit organization based in Unionville, Virginia, United States. The group's mission is to help the children of Vietnam.[1][2] Independent of any actual affiliations, it is still an unaffilated partner with the Fund For Fallen Allies (FFFA) charity that is based in nearby Alexandria, Virginia.
 It builds ""turnkey"" schools to modern standards, ready for occupation.
 The Vietnam Children's Fund mission is to build a network of elementary schools in Vietnam as a living memorial to all those who perished in the Vietnam War.
 The Vietnam Children's Fund was founded in 1993 by Kieu Chinh, an actress, lecturer, and philanthropist, Terry Anderson, journalist, and the late Lewis Burwell Puller, Jr., a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and severely wounded marine. Puller believed that in war no one goes unscathed but that children, the most vulnerable of all, suffer the greatest hardships. He felt the Vietnam Children's Fund was a gesture that could not only help close the past but ensure a brighter future for the children of Vietnam.
 The first school, located on the former demilitarized zone in Quảng Trị Province, was dedicated in Puller's name in April 1994, the 20th anniversary of the end of the war.
 VCF has now completed 50 schools which serve more than 30,000 children. Many schools are built in the poorest and most remote areas of the country where the need is greatest.
 VCF's signature design is a modern two-storey facility that serves 350 children (or as many as 700 attending in shifts) and provides eight classrooms, a library, electricity, and bathrooms. As the schools are often the newest and most structurally sound buildings in these communities they are also used for town gatherings, meetings and celebrations. In areas prone to flooding, the VCF school may be the only two-storey building in a region where villagers can go to escape disaster. Quality control, accountability for funds, sound engineering, and sound design are keystones of VCF activity in Vietnam.
 Normally, 85 cents of each dollar raised goes directly to school construction. VCF does not take government funds. Funding is all private from individuals, foundations, corporations and the Combined Federal Campaign. Corporate gifts include those from FedEx, Coca-Cola, Citigroup, Conoco and American Eagle Outfitters.
 With a million babies born in Vietnam each year, the need for new schools could not be met even with the most generous imaginable foreign aid from all countries and World Bank assistance. Thus, funds used by VCF do not duplicate or substitute for any activity of other donors. VCF meets a need that otherwise would simply not be fulfilled.
 VCF hopes to build one elementary school in each of Vietnam's provinces and to create enough classroom space to teach 58,000 children—the number of names on the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington, DC.

Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial_Fund	"The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, Inc. (VVMF), was a non-profit organization established on April 27, 1979, by Jan Scruggs, a former Army Infantry in Vietnam. Others veterans joined including, Jack Wheeler, and several other graduates of West Point to finance the construction of a memorial to those Americans who served or died during the Vietnam War. The memorial was not designed to make a political statement about the war itself. From this fund came the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, dedicated  on Veterans Day, 1982, on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.
 The Memorial was established by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, Inc. (VVMF), the nonprofit, charitable organization incorporated on April 27, 1979.
 VVMF wanted Vietnam veterans to have a tangible symbol of recognition from the American people. By separating the issue of the service of the individual men and women from the issue of U.S. policy in Vietnam, VVMF hoped to begin a process of national reconciliation.  The vision of a Memorial of names flowed from the academic work at American University of Jan Scruggs about which he testified to the US Senate.  The hope was that the Memorial of names would help surviving veterans and the nation to recover from the Vietnam War.
 Significant initial support came from U.S. Senators Charles McC. Mathias, Jr., (R-Md.) and John W. Warner (R-Va.). On Nov. 8, 1979, Sen. Mathias introduced legislation to authorize a site of national park land for the memorial. The first significant financial contributions to launch the national fundraising campaign were raised by Sen. Warner.
 More than $8,000,000 was raised, all of which came from private sources. Corporations, foundations, unions, veterans groups and civic organizations contributed, but most importantly, more than 275,000 individual Americans donated the majority of the money needed to build the Memorial.
 On July 1, 1980, Congress authorized a site of three acres in Constitution Gardens near the Lincoln Memorial. In October of that year, VVMF announced a national design competition open to any U.S. citizen over 18 years of age. By Dec. 29, 1981, there were 2,573 registrants, and the competition became the largest of its kind ever held in the United States.
 By the March 31, 1981 deadline, 1,421 design entries had been submitted. All entries were judged anonymously by a jury of eight internationally recognized artists and designers who had been selected by VVMF. On May 1, 1981, the jury presented its unanimous selection for first prize, which was accepted and adopted enthusiastically by VVMF.
 The winning design was the work of Maya Ying Lin of Athens, Ohio, a 21-year-old senior at Yale University. In August 1981, VVMF selected a building company and architecture firm to develop the plans and build Lin's design. Lin became a design consultant to the architect of record.
 In January 1982, the decision was made to add a flagstaff and sculpture on the Memorial site in order to provide a realistic depiction of three Vietnam servicemen and a symbol of their courage and devotion to their country. On March 11, 1982, the design and plans received final federal approval, and work at the site was begun on March 16, 1982. Ground was formally broken on Friday, March 26, 1982.
 In July 1982, VVMF selected Washington, D.C. sculptor Frederick Hart to design the sculpture of the servicemen to be placed at the site. The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts finally unanimously accepted the proposed sculpture and flagstaff.
 Construction at the site was completed in November 1982.  The Memorial was dedicated on Nov. 13, 1982. The Three Servicemen statue was added in 1984. That same year, the Memorial was given as a ""gift"" to the American people during a ceremony with President Ronald Reagan.
 In 1993, the Vietnam Women's Memorial by sculptor Glenna Goodacre was added to the Memorial site to represent the heroic work of women who served in the Vietnam War.
 In 2000, Congress authorized the placement on the Memorial site of a plaque honoring post-war casualties of Vietnam whose names are not eligible for inscription on The Wall. VVMF worked with several organizations and architects to ensure that the plaque is harmonious with the site's other elements.[1]
 The founders of the memorial set forth to collect several million dollars from private donors. In its first three years, the VVMF collected more than $8 million from more than 275,000 Americans.
 In October 1980, the VVMF announced a contest for the design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial would be open to anyone over 18 years of age. The contest was the largest of its kind ever held in the United States, with over 2,573 contestants, and was judged by eight professional artists and architects. The winner of the contest was Maya Ying Lin, who submitted the idea for a wall.  The material would be highly reflective black granite.
 The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund wanted, above all, for the memorial to have a prominent site in a large, park-like area; thus, the western end of Constitution Gardens was requested as the site. Subsequently, VVMF set four major criteria for the design: (1) that it be reflective and contemplative in character, (2) that it harmonize with its surroundings, especially the neighboring national memorials, (3) that it contain the names of all who died or remain missing, and (4) that it make no political statement about the war.
 Maya Lin conceived her design as creating a park within a park — a quiet protected place unto itself, yet harmonious with the overall plan of Constitution Gardens. To achieve this effect she chose polished black granite for the walls. Its mirror-like surface reflects the images of the surrounding trees, lawns and monuments. The Memorial's walls point to the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial, thus bringing the Memorial into the historical context of our country. The names are inscribed in the chronological order of their dates of casualty, showing the war as a series of individual human sacrifices and giving each name a special place in history. 
 Statement by Maya Ying Lin, March, 1981
(presented as part of her competition submission)
  
""Walking through this park-like area, the memorial appears as a rift in the earth, a long, polished, black stone wall, emerging from and receding into the earth. Approaching the memorial, the ground slopes gently downward and the low walls emerging on either side, growing out of the earth, extend and converge at a point below and ahead. Walking into this grassy site contained by the walls of the memorial we can barely make out the carved names upon the memorial's walls. These names, seemingly infinite in number, convey the sense of overwhelming numbers, while unifying these individuals into a whole.
""The memorial is composed not as an unchanging monument, but as a moving composition to be understood as we move into and out of it. The passage itself is gradual; the descent to the origin slow, but it is at the origin that the memorial is to be fully understood. At the intersection of these walls, on the right side, is carved the date of the first death. It is followed by the names of those who died in the war, in chronological order. These names continue on this wall appearing to recede into the earth at the wall's end. The names resume on the left wall as the wall emerges from the earth, continuing back to the origin where the date of the last death is carved at the bottom of this wall. Thus the war's beginning and end meet; the war is ‘complete,' coming full-circle, yet broken by the earth that bounds the angle's open side, and continued within the earth itself. As we turn to leave, we see these walls stretching into the distance, directing us to the Washington Monument, to the left, and the Lincoln Memorial, to the right, thus bringing the Vietnam Memorial into an historical context. We the living are brought to a concrete realization of these deaths.
 ""Brought to a sharp awareness of such a loss, it is up to each individual to resolve or come to terms with this loss. For death, is in the end a personal and private matter, and the area contained with this memorial is a quiet place, meant for personal reflection and private reckoning. The black granite walls, each two hundred feet long, and ten feet below ground at their lowest point (gradually ascending toward ground level) effectively act as a sound barrier, yet are of such a height and length so as not to appear threatening or enclosing. The actual area is wide and shallow, allowing for a sense of privacy, and the sunlight from the memorial's southern exposure along with the grassy park surrounding and within its walls, contribute to the serenity of the area. Thus this memorial is for those who have died, and for us to remember them.
 ""The memorial's origin is located approximately at the center of the site; its legs each extending two hundred feet towards the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. The walls, contained on one side by the earth, are ten feet below ground at their point of origin, gradually lessening in height, until they finally recede totally into the earth, at their ends. The walls are to be made of a hard, polished black granite, with the names to be carved in a simple Trojan letter. The memorial's construction involves recontouring the area within the wall's boundaries, so as to provide for an easily accessible descent, but as much of the site as possible should be left untouched. The area should remain as a park, for all to enjoy.""[2]
 Construction of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial began on March 16, 1982, though the official ground-breaking was on Friday, March 26, 1982. The construction was finished in late October 1982. The memorial was formally dedicated on November 13, 1982. The Three Soldiers statue by Frederick Hart was added in 1984, and the Vietnam Women's Memorial was added in 1993.
 The various elements of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial complex on the National Mall have been a subject of numerous controversies revolving around design issues. Probably no other major US memorial has been as controversial. This perhaps partially reflects the controversial nature of the war itself.
 Today, the VVMF continues to support the maintenance of the Memorial, though the memorial itself is maintained by National Park Service staff and some military representatives. It also funds the addition of new names to the Wall and creating directories of names currently on the Wall. WWW.VVMF.ORG
 The Wall That Heals is a traveling half-scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial started in 1996.  It also features a Traveling Museum and Information Center.
 The Education Center at The Wall is the newest initiative of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund.  Approved by Congress in 2003 the Education Center is going to be a two-story underground facility adjacent to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
 In 2017, the group announced an initiative to find pictures of all those whose names are on The Wall.  The group wants to have digital images and profiles for every veteran as part of its planned Education Center.  The nonprofit wants to have computers within the Education Center to link names with a digital photo and service background, as well as an online feature displaying names engraved on The Wall with a photo and profile for those who want to know more but are not present at the memorial.[3] As of 2019, digital images of Vietnam Veterans can be found on the VVMF website and visitors can post remembrances about that person.[4]"
Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_of_America_Foundation	"The Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF),[1] established in 1980, now the Veterans for America (VFA), is a Washington, D.C.-based international humanitarian organization that addresses the consequences of war and conflict. The founder of VVAF is Bobby Muller, a former U.S. Marine lieutenant and Vietnam veteran.
 In 1980, co-founders Bobby Muller and John Terzano created Vietnam Veteran of America Foundation with the goal of transforming the American experience of the Vietnam War into a mission of compassion and justice.  VVAF's first major initiative was a journey back to Vietnam in 1981 to make peace with the country.  In 1991, after a trip to the Killing Fields of Cambodia, VVAF co-founded and coordinated the global campaign to ban landmines, called Campaign for A Landmine Free World, which was awarded the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to persuade countries to sign a treaty eradicating the use of antipersonnel landmines.  In 1992, VVAF opened a clinic on the outskirts of Phnom Penh to offer rehabilitative services to landmine victims.
 One of VVAF's primary causes is Campaign for a Landmine Free World, which works to increase awareness of the world's landmine crisis. As of 2002, VVAF operated programs in Angola, Cambodia, El Salvador, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Vietnam.
 Since early 1998, a number of top musical artists have contributed to the cause through VVAF's Artists for a Landmine Free World. Some of the program's most active members include Emmylou Harris, Sheryl Crow, Steve Earle, Nanci Griffith, Willie Nelson, Lucinda Williams, Bruce Cockburn, Bruce Springsteen, and Mary Chapin Carpenter.
 VVAF was a cofounder of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), which was awarded the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize jointly with coordinator Jody Williams of the VVAF. Loung Ung serves as National Spokesperson for the Campaign for a Landmine-Free World.
 Many survivors of war require physical and emotional rehabilitation. VVAF's Post-Conflict Rehabilitation Program (PCR) provides support through product services, physical and emotional training, and sport rehabilitation. It has provided rehabilitation services in Angola, Ethiopia, Cambodia, and Vietnam, and supports rehabilitation and disability programs throughout Central America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Thousands of people who suffer from disabilities caused by war or debilitating diseases such as polio and clubfoot benefit every year from artificial limbs, braces and wheelchairs produced at VVAF clinics. In addition, patients are enrolled in physical therapy sessions where they develop the strength, flexibility and skills to become mobile again. VVAF's community follow-up and outreach teams bring assistance to people where they live. And through the creation of self-help groups and the implementation of sports and recreation activities through its Sports for Life initiative, people develop the confidence, skills, and social networks necessary to become active participants in their societies.
 Sports for Life (SFL), a project of PCR, uses athletic activity and play as vehicles for bringing about positive changes in the lives of people with disabilities. The SFL program uses therapeutic and competitive sports to rehabilitate disabled persons in war-affected nations, helping them to build physical and social skills and develop the confidence to improve their lives in other ways. SFL has conducted successful programs in Kosovo, Angola and Cambodia. In March 2006 two athletic superstars, 2000 NFL MVP Ray Lewis and Paralympian Cheri Blauwet joined the Sports for Life Advisory Committee and travelled to Africa with VVAF to support and promote new developments in Ethiopia and Angola.
 VVAF's Information Management and Mine Action Programs (iMMAP) works in post-conflict countries, including Iraq, Vietnam and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to evaluate the impact of landmines and provide technical assistance to coordinate information necessary for relief and development. IMMAP started from the basic premise that implementing organizations, national authorities and donor governments needed to be able to define the global landmine problem's physical, social and economic dimensions as a prerequisite for effective planning, resource allocation and advocacy. Its efforts resulted[citation needed] in broad international acceptance of landmine survey standards and socio-economic measures of landmine/UXO impact. In the winter of 2005 and beginning of 2006, tsunamis and earthquakes devastated much of Southeast Asia and Pakistan. iMMAP's information management support helped guide and maximize relief efforts by assisting in surveying hazardous and safe routes for transportation, supplies and locations for shelter. In January 2006, an iMMAP survey of Iraqi communities found that one in five areas in northern and southern Iraq were endangered by landmines and other unexploded ordnance.[citation needed]
 VVAF's Nuclear Threat Reduction Campaign (NTRC) educates and mobilizes key constituencies to advance US public policy on a bipartisan basis that reduces the threats posed by nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. In late 2005, NTRC was largely responsible[citation needed] for the rejection of a government bill that would have allowed the use of robust nuclear earth penetrator (RNEP) bombs, commonly known as ""bunker busters"".
 VVAF's newest  programs, War Kids Relief and Returnee Integration Support Program were launched in November 2005. War Kids Relief, led by former Iraq veteran and captain Jon Powers, helps of Iraqi children recover from the disruptive effects of war. The program works to improve the physical conditions of existing housing facilities and provide training to orphanage directors and caregivers, integrate children back into safe family environments, and with Construct a Baghdad Career and Life Skills Center works to provide a safe haven for older children (age 12–18) and give them a place to learn job and life-training skills.
 The Returnee Integration Support Program (RISP) helps Cambodian refugees readjust to Cambodia's lifestyle and culture. Through its services, the program provides orientation, assistance with employment and housing, drug, alcohol and HIV education, Khmer literacy classes, counseling and referral services, in order to support returnees who seek help in becoming independent and productive members of society."
Virtu Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtu_Foundation	"The Virtu Foundation is a non-profit organization that supports higher level music education with a particular focus on string instruments. It organizes the donation or loan of high quality cellos, violas, and violins to the Foundation, so that they may be loaned to young musicians. The Foundation’s goal is to help young musicians develop advanced musical skills with experience of the use of high-quality instruments they could not otherwise afford.[2]
 Instruments are loaned to young musicians on Scholarships.  When the terms of Scholarship loans expire, the instruments are placed with new musicians. Over 70 musicians have received such Scholarship loans since the foundation was established.[3] Loans are made on a competitive basis to students from any country who reside in the United States or Canada. Recipients of these Scholarships currently include students at East Carolina University, Eastman School of Music, Juilliard School, New England Conservatory, and Princeton University.[4]
 The Virtu Foundation has also supported organizations committed to sustaining public performances of classical music,[5] as well as classical music education programs.[6] It is a tax-exempt non-profit organization.[7]
 The instruments are placed as two-year scholarships through periodic competitions. The selection process includes blind evaluations of musical competence, and consideration is given to financial resources, instrument need, and an estimated of the benefit extended use of a better instrument would bring to a musician’s career. The Foundation bears the expense of acquiring or borrowing the instruments, and recipients make semi-annual contributions to a fund that insures that the instruments are well maintained.[8]
 The Foundation provides occasional support community-based string teaching programs for children.[9]"
Voluntary Service Overseas	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_Service_Overseas	"Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) is a not-for-profit international development organization charity with a vision for a ""world without poverty"" and a mission to ""bring people together to fight poverty and marginalisation"".[1] VSO delivers development impact through a blend volunteer model consisting of international, national, and community volunteers working together to develop the systems and conditions for positive social change [2]
As of 2018, VSO worked in 24 countries in Africa and Asia[3]
 VSO currently works in the following core programme areas: 
 And through three core approaches that are relevant to all the areas:
 In addition, VSO has a youth focus in which young people are both the beneficiaries of social change outcomes as well as the primary actors in creating the change. 
 Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) is a company limited by guarantee. VSO operates internationally largely through branch offices. Exceptions to this are:
 In March 2018, Voluntary Service Overseas USA, Inc. was incorporated, and an application has been made to register this entity as a US 501 (c) organisation(iii). 
 VSO's governing body is the International Board, currently comprising 9 trustees. It also has two youth advisors to the Board. The day-to-day management of VSO is carried out by the Executive Board. The Executive Board has operational oversight of VSO's global work. Each Executive Board member is responsible for a function of VSO: People, Programmes, Business Development, and Finance. 
 VSO was founded in 1958 by Alec and Mora Dickson through a bishop's letter to the London paper,[4] The Sunday Times, as an educational experience overseas for school-leavers, initially only male, before starting university. Volunteers offered unskilled help in return for basic accommodation and pocket money. In 1962, the practice changed to using university graduate volunteers.[5]
 By 1980, the unskilled volunteers had been completely phased out and the length of service had been extended to two years.[6] Active volunteer numbers initially dropped to about 750, but by 2003 had returned to about 1,400. Since December 2004, applications to volunteer have been accepted from those between ages 20 and 75, who also must have at least two years' experience in their field. 
 In the early 1990s, in order to meet growing demand for highly specialised and skilled volunteers from its partners in developing countries, VSO established partner agencies in Canada, the Netherlands, Kenya/Uganda (VSO Jitolee), and the Philippines (VSO Bahaginan).[7] In 2004, VSO launched a partnership called iVolunteer Overseas (iVO) in India with iVolunteer, an existing volunteering program of MITRA, an Indian NGO. VSO's structure evolved to become an international federation which now includes Ireland, China and India as well as the above named countries.[8]  International volunteers are recruited through all of these bases, and they can be placed in any one of VSO's programmes (e.g. an Irish volunteer working in Nepal, or a Ugandan volunteer working in Tajikistan).[9]
 From 2011, VSO led a consortium to deliver the UK government's International Citizen Service programme that provides international volunteer placements for 18- to 25-year-olds[10]. The programme, funded by the Department for International Development (DFID), now includes Raleigh International and Restless Development. In 2016/17, 3,090 young people volunteered through the International Citizen Service programme.  [11]
 In 2017, VSO was awarded a grant of £50 million from the UK's Department of International Development (DFID) for a program called ""Volunteering for Development."" The three-year initiative aims to improve quality and access to health and education services as well as livelihood opportunities for the most poor and vulnerable, and targets more than 2 million of the poorest and most marginalised people across the globe. The grant supports VSO's vision to enhance effectiveness across a number of vital areas - including in VSO's ""core approaches"" of social inclusion & gender, social accountability, and resilience. During its first year the project successfully placed 606 international volunteers and 920 national volunteers across VSO's four areas of focus. [12]
 Highlights of VSO today include:
 VSO works with local partners in the communities they work with, placing volunteers with these partners to help increase their impact and effectiveness. VSO also works with corporate partners, such as Accenture,[18] and Randstad.[19] and Syngenta with whom it is working to build the livelihoods of poor and marginalised farmers in Bangladesh [20]"
Volunteers of America	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteers_of_America	"Volunteers of America (VOA) is a faith-based nonprofit organization founded in 1896 that provides affordable housing and other assistance services primarily to low-income people throughout the United States. Headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, the organization includes 32 affiliates and serves approximately 1.5 million people each year in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.[4]
 In addition to those in need of affordable housing, VOA assists veterans, low-income seniors, children and families, the homeless, those with intellectual disabilities, those recovering from addiction, and the formerly incarcerated.[4]
 Volunteers of America was founded on March 8, 1896 by social reformers Ballington Booth and his wife Maud Booth in Cooper Union's Great Hall.[5] Ballington Booth was the son of General William Booth, founder of The Salvation Army, and the couple served as officers with the Army in Great Britain.
 The Booths first moved to New York in the 1890s to assume command of The Salvation Army forces in the United States. The couple was successful in bolstering the image of The Salvation Army in America and in growing the movement's social work mission. After disagreements with other Salvation Army leaders, including Ballington Booth's brother Bramwell Booth, the Booths left the organization and established Volunteers of America.[6]
 In the early 1900s, the organization began an expansive philanthropic program that included employment bureaus, co-operative stores, medical dispensaries, distribution of clothes, women's sewing classes, Thanksgiving meals, reading rooms, fresh air camps and other establishments.[7] During the advent of the Great Depression in the 1930s, Volunteers of America mobilized to assist the millions of people who were unemployed, hungry and homeless. Relief efforts included employment bureaus, wood yards, soup kitchens and ""Penny Pantries"" where every food item cost one cent.[8]
 By the 1960s, Volunteers of America was well known for its thrift stores and annual fundraising efforts like the Sidewalk Santa campaign in New York City. In an effort to modernize its programs, the organization began to focus its work in the area of housing for the poor following the establishment of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.[9]
 Volunteers of America is ranked among the largest charities in the United States by The NonProfit Times,[10] The Chronicle of Philanthropy[11] and Forbes among other publications, with annual revenue of more than $1 billion in 2015. The organization is one of the largest nonprofit providers of affordable housing for the elderly, low-income families and people with intellectual or physical disabilities in the United States.[12]
 When Volunteers of America was founded in 1896, volunteerism in the modern sense of the word did not exist. To ""volunteer"" at that time meant serving others as a full-time vocation. Early members of the organization came to call themselves the ""Volunteers of America"" to differentiate themselves from The Salvation Army as an organization by Americans, for Americans.[13]
 In fact, Volunteers of America is staffed primarily by paid staff, rather than unpaid volunteers. More than 16,000 paid professionals serve as administrators, caregivers, skilled nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, housing experts, architects, and a number of other positions at the organization.[14]
 As of 2017 the organization owned and/or managed around 19,000 affordable housing units that provide homes to nearly 25,000 people each year.[15]
 In 2009 Affordable Housing Finance magazine ranked Volunteers of America as the top nonprofit in its ""Top 50 Affordable Housing Owners,""[16] and also ranked the organization in the ""Top 50 Affordable Housing Developers"" in 2007[17] and ""Top 10 Companies Completing Acquisitions.""[18] The magazine also selected a Volunteers of America multifamily community, Lord Tennyson outside San Francisco, as the ""best of the best"" affordable housing project in the country for 2007.[19]
 VoA also reaches out to homeless people in many cities through street outreach and mobile outreach services.[20]
 In 2017, Volunteers of America has donated a backpack to every student living in New York City shelters, resulting in the donation of over 140,000 backpacks over 14 years.[21]"
The W. Garfield Weston Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_W._Garfield_Weston_Foundation	"The W. Garfield Weston Foundation is a Canadian charitable foundation committed to making grants in Canada for the benefit of Canadians. [3] At the end of 2016, the Foundation had over $324 million in assets. [2]
 The Foundation was created in the 1950s with donations from W. Garfield Weston (1898–1978) and his wife Reta Lila Howard (1897–1967), and from all of their nine children: Miriam Burnett, Grainger Weston, Nancy Baron, Barbara Mitchell, Garry Weston, Wendy Rebanks, Gretchen Bauta, Camilla Dalglish and Galen Weston. It is named for W. Garfield Weston, who established bakery and other successful enterprises throughout Canada and in other parts of the world. Today, these businesses include George Weston Limited and the Loblaw group of food retailing, processing and distribution companies.
 The Foundation is supported by an endowment from the extended Weston family, with the majority of the funds being directed to specific organizations in the fields of education and the environment. In 2012, the Foundation initiated the Weston Family Parks Challenge, announcing $5 million in aggregate over 3 years, to enhance Toronto's green spaces while encouraging private-public partnerships for their long-term sustainability. [4][5] The Foundation also supports the Weston Youth Innovation Award at the Ontario Science Centre, with past recipients including Adam Noble and Alex Deans.
 In addition to its principal ongoing commitments, the Foundation makes a number of trustee-initiated grants each year. [1]"
W. K. Kellogg Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._K._Kellogg_Foundation	"The W. K. Kellogg Foundation was founded in June 1930 as the W. K. Kellogg Child Welfare Foundation by breakfast cereal pioneer Will Keith Kellogg. In 1934, Kellogg donated more than $66 million in Kellogg Company stock and other investments to the W. K. Kellogg Trust (equivalent to $990 million in 2018[1]). As with other endowments, the yearly income from this trust funds the foundation.
 In the early 21st century, the foundation is the seventh largest philanthropic foundation in the U.S. In 2005, the foundation reported that the total assets of the foundation and its trust were US$7.3 billion; about US$5.5 billion of this was in Kellogg Company stock. The foundation funded US$243 million in grants and programs in its 2005 fiscal year. 82% of this was spent in the United States; 9% in southern Africa; and 9% in Latin America and the Caribbean.
 In 1996, it supplied a multi-year grant worth $750,000 ($1.13 million in 2018 dollars[1]) to start mass salt fluoridation programs which were then carried out by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), covering 350 million people in Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Venezuela.  The project was part of a multi-year plan launched by PAHO in 1994 to ""fluoridate the entire Region of the Americas"". More recently, they have provided funding for HealthCorps to prevent childhood obesity by encouraging students to take personal responsibility for their health and wellness.[2]
 The foundation provides a number of grants to organizations across the United States and other countries on a number of topics.
 In 2016, the Kellogg Foundation was funding more than 40 projects in Indian country, with a total value of more than $30 million in open grants. According to the non-profit's website, the foundation has funded 380 Native American projects since 2008. Many grants are for health, education and language programs for children and youths.[3]
In 2009 it granted the third-highest amount of money to Native American projects, after the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Ford Foundation.[3]
 One grantee is the Birth to Five Policy Alliance, whose mission is to increase public and private support so young children, particularly those facing the most challenges, get the high-quality services they need to be successful.[4]
 The foundation has made grants to prominent educational institutions, including: 
 The foundation supports multiple programs for optimal child development.[8]
 It supports oral hygiene. In 2010, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation started a dental therapy program in five states to educate children and their families about the importance of healthy teeth. Mobile dental vans travel to rural areas to give families access to dental care. Additionally, the foundation gives grants to help minorities attend school for dentistry.[9]
 The foundation also supports New Options Initiative (For Youth), an initiative that seeks to establish new pathways connecting out-of-school young adults ages 16 – 24 with meaningful career opportunities.
 The philanthropy expert Waldemar A. Nielsen said that the Kellogg Foundation ""is substantially better than it is generally seen to be"".[10]"
The Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walter_and_Duncan_Gordon_Foundation	"The Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation is a private charitable foundation focused on the improvement of public policy in Canada.[1] The foundation is based in Toronto, Ontario, and has two major areas of focus: the Arctic and Water Security.
 The Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation was founded in 1965 by Walter L. Gordon, his wife, Elizabeth (née Counsell), and his brother, Duncan Gordon. Walter Gordon was a Canadian businessman and politician; he was the Minister of Finance from 1963- 1965 and the president of the Privy Council 1967-1968.  Later on in his life he was the Chancellor of York University. Duncan Gordon was a chartered accountant at various Toronto firms.
 Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the Gordons made a number of contributions to healthcare, the arts and public policy, including donations to hospitals, hospices and art programs in and around the Toronto area. Various Canadian think tanks such as the Canadian Institute of International Affairs (now the Canadian International Council) were supported by the Foundation.
 In the 1970s the foundation refocused its funding towards Canada's economic independence, and helped create the Committee for an Independent Canada.[2]
 During the 1970s and 1980s the Foundation also focused much of their attention on peacekeeping, peacemaking and nuclear disarmament. There were many recipients of grants from the Foundation, including Science for Peace, the Club of Rome, Amnesty International, Physicians for Social Responsibility, United Nations Association of Canada, and the Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies. The Foundation also helped to publicize the problem of acid rain in 1981; this contributed to amendments to the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1990.
 After the death of Walter Gordon in 1987, Duncan Gordon asked Pierre Trudeau's former primary secretary and speechwriter Thomas Axworthy to help develop a focus for the foundation with regards to peace-building.  After the death of Duncan Gordon later on that year, Walter Duncan's children took over the foundation and headed the board of directors. They also expanded the Foundation from a family to a private foundation model.  The directors decided to refocus the Foundation's mandate to concentrate on four areas of interest: secondary education; peace, security and conflict management; the environment and the Arctic.
 The Foundation endowed the Walter Gordon Forum on Public Policy in 1990, which continues as an annual event at Massey College with the School of Public Policy and Global Governance at the University of Toronto.
 After the amendments to the U.S. Clean Air Act, the Foundation started to focus on federal environmental policy. The Foundation narrowed its environmental to focus air quality and water issues. In the 1990s the Foundation also helped to create MiningWatch Canada, People for Education and the Manitoba School Improvement Program.
 The foundation's efforts for peace, security and conflict management eventually combined with their concentration on the Arctic.  The Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation along, with Science for Peace and Finnish researchers, worked to promoted the creation of the Arctic Council.  Arctic scholars, including Franklyn Griffiths, John Lamb and Bill Fox, as well as politician Tony Penikett, and indigenous advocates Rosemarie Kuptana Mary Simon and the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, collaborated with the Canadian government to create the Arctic Council and the Canadian Ambassador for Circumpolar Affairs in 1994. The Foundation also supported Sheila Watt-Cloutier during her leadership as the Chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference.
 In 2009, Thomas Axworthy became CEO and President of the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation. Because of reduced funding, some of the programs were wound down, and the Foundation at that time focused its activities on policies about fresh water and the Arctic.
 The Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation funded a legal analysis which clarified the circumstances under which First Nations were eligible to receive grants from foundations, clarifying First Nations as legal donees under Canada Revenue Agency's Income Tax Act.[3]
 The Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation helped create the IBA Community Toolkit, a resource to First Nation, Inuit and Métis communities to educate them about the benefit agreements in their areas.  The toolkit is based around the mining sector, and is applicable within the natural resource industry.[4]
 The Union of BC Indian Chiefs, Ecotrust Canada and the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation came together to fund and publish Living Proof, a how-to manual written by Terry N. Tobias for designing and carrying out data-collection during indigenous use and occupancy map surveys.
In the 1990s the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation collaborated with David Schindler a limnologist at the University of Alberta.
 More recently, the Foundation along with Tides Canada, helped fund studies which, unlike a joint industry-government panel report, supported the view that pollutant levels in the north are due to human development rather than natural sources.[5][6] in the Alberta Oilsands. The foundation has also collaborated with the Circle on Philanthropy and Aboriginal Peoples, a network which promotes social investing in Aboriginal communities in Canada.
 The Global Citizenship Program, set up to discuss Canada's role in the world, was headed from 2005-2010 by the former President and CEO of the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation Patrick Johnston. The program was suspended in 2010 after the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation's budget was restructured.
 Between 2010 and 2014 the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation supported the Arctic Security Program in conjunction with the Canada Centre for Global Security Studies at the Munk School of Global Affairs. In January 2011 the Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation along with the Canada Centre for Global Security Studies at the Munk School of Global Affairs released a public opinion poll focused on the global perceptions of Arctic Security called “Rethinking the Top of the World”.[7] About 2,800 Canadians, including 744 residents of the territories,[8]  were surveyed along with residents of the seven other Arctic Council states (Russia, United States, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland and Greenland/ Denmark) totaling 9,000 people.[9] The survey findings garnered substantial media attention globally.[10][11][12]
 The Arctic Program focuses on Nunavut, Yukon and the Northwest Territories, as well as Northern Quebec (Nunavik) and Northern Labrador (Nunatsiavut). The program encourages leadership and government participation by young Northern Canadians, promotes equity in the distribution of benefits from exploiting natural resources, and supports issues in the Arctic related to food security, search and rescue, and human and capital infrastructure.
 The Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation has supported legal, regulatory and citizen action activities to protect the quality and quantity of fresh water resources in Canada, and to ensure access to drinking water to all Canadians.[13] Beginning in March, 2011, the foundation has helped to organize Canadian Water Week.  That year the foundation, along with the Inter-Action Council held an international conference discussing global water security and policy. The conference was chaired by Jean Chrétien the former Prime Minister of Canada, Olusegun Obasanjo the former President of Nigeria and former Chancellor of Austria Franz Vranitzky.[14] In May 2011, the foundation's Tom Axworthy was appointed Secretary General of the InterAction Council.
 The Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation funded the Forum for Leadership in Water (FLOW) and Tides Canada, both of which promote water security and education for Canadians. After 15 years, the foundation withdrew its funding from the Munk School's Program on Water Issues in 2016.[15] Tom Axworthy, the Foundation president, also created the Mackenzie Data Stream, an online system that provides real time access to communities and decision makers on water quality indicators.
 With the passing of Jane Glassco, the daughter of Walter and Elizabeth Gordon in 2010, the foundation set up an Arctic Fellowship Program. The fellowships are presented to young Northerners, many of which are of Aboriginal descent between the ages of 25-35. The J.M Kaplan Fund co-funds the Program.
 During her lifetime Elizabeth Gordon contributed to and supported the local arts, including funding to the Shaw Festival and the Art Gallery of Ontario. The Elizabeth L. Gordon Art Program helps Ontario galleries expand their collections. It was suspended after 2009."
Waste No Food	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_No_Food	"Waste No Food is a [non-profit organization] that provides a web-based food rescue ""marketplace"" allowing excess food to be donated from the food service industry to qualified charities that work with the needy. It facilitates the donation of food waste from farms, restaurants and grocery stores to charities that can use it. Recipient charities are vetted by InnVision.[1]
 The nonprofit was founded by Kiran Sridhar, then a 12-year-old 7th grader at a Bay Area school, as a way to improve the distribution of food and reduce waste. Sridhar, now a sophomore at Stanford University, still heads the organization.[2] Waste No Food was initially focused in the Silicon Valley area and has been expanded to San Francisco.[3]"

WE Charity	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WE_Charity	"WE Charity, formerly known as Free The Children, is an international development charity and youth empowerment movement founded in 1995 by human rights advocates Marc and Craig Kielburger.[1] The organization implements development programs in Asia, Africa and Latin America, focusing on education, water, health, food and economic opportunity.[2] It also runs domestic programming for young people in Canada, the U.S. and U.K., promoting service learning and active citizenship.[3]
 This includes WE Day, a series of large-scale motivational events held in 17 cities throughout the school year.
 WE Charity promotes a philosophy of socially conscious living, embodied in the phrase ""ME to WE"" – the title of a 2004 book by Craig and Marc Kielburger.[10] That brand theme ""we"" is reflected in the organization's programs such as its WE Day events, launched in 2007,[11] leading up to a updated branding of ""WE Charity"" in early 2015. 
 
The organization has received high ratings from independent third-party charitable sector evaluators including Charity Navigator[1], Charity Intelligence[2], GuideStar[4], and MoneySense Magazine’s 100 Top-Rated Charities in Canada.[5] In 2017, Good Housekeeping Magazine chose WE Charity as the first recipient of a new ‘Humanitarian Seal.’[6] WE Charity (formerly Free The Children) was founded in 1995 by Craig Kielburger when he was 12 years old. Craig was reading through the Toronto Star newspaper before school one day when he came across an article about the murder of a 12-year-old Pakistani boy named Iqbal Masih, a former child factory worker who had spoken out against child labour.[7]
 Soon after, Kielburger established Free The Children with a group of his 12-year-old classmates. The organization was formed to raise awareness in North America about child labour and to encourage other children to get involved in the issue.[8]
 One of the group's first actions was to collect 3,000 signatures on a petition to the prime minister of India, calling for the release of imprisoned child labour activist Kailash Satyarthi,[9] who went on to win the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize.[10] The petition was sent in a shoe box wrapped in brown paper. On his eventual release, Satyarthi said, ""It was one of the most powerful actions taken on my behalf, and for me, definitely the most memorable.""[9]
 Shortly afterward, Kielburger spoke at the convention of the Ontario Federation of Labour, where union representatives pledged $150,000 for a rehabilitation centre in India. The Bal Ashram centre was built by Satyarthi.[11]
 In December 1995, Kielburger embarked on an eight-week tour of South Asia to meet child labourers and hear their stories first-hand. It was on that trip that Kielburger had a meeting with then-Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, in which Kielburger convinced Chrétien to take a public stand against child slavery.[12]
 In 1999, at the age of 16, Kielburger wrote Free the Children, a book detailing his trip to South Asia four years earlier and the founding of his charity.[13] The book was re-released in 2007 with Me to We Books.[14]
 Free The Children initially fundraised for organizations that raided factories and freed children from forced labour situations. When it became clear that the rescued children were being resold by their impoverished families, the organization changed its approach. Free The Children started building schools in Nicaragua, Kenya, Ecuador and India.[15] The organization later evolved an international development model with projects related to education, water, health care, food security and income generation.[16]
 In 2007, at age 25, Craig Kielburger was inducted into the Order of Canada.[17] the second-youngest Canadian ever to receive the honour. His brother Marc Kielburger was inducted into the Order of Canada in 2010.[18]
 In 2008, EY and the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, a sister organization of the World Economic Forum, presented the Social Entrepreneur Of The Year award in Canada to the Kielburgers for their work with Free The Children.[19]
 In 2016, Free The Children rebranded as WE Charity.[20] The charity runs domestic programs for young people in Canada, the US and the UK, and international development programs in Africa, Asia and Latin America.[2]
 In September 2017, WE Charity moved to a new headquarters in downtown Toronto, Canada. Named the “WE Global Learning Centre”, it provides office space for staff and features technology-enabled facilities for use by public groups such as educators, school groups, and youth wishing to start non-profits or social enterprises.[21] The official opening of the WE Global Learning Centre on September 27, 2017 was attended by international figures including former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, and actor and activist Mia Farrow.[22] The Centre features a theatre, broadcast studio, and an open concept design. WE Charity is also looking to integrate its new headquarters into the Toronto Corktown community by offering programming and outreach projects to residents.[23]
 In December 2018 WE Charity proposed a 41,000-square-foot WE Social Entrepreneurship Centre to be constructed next to its Global Learning Centre. The new centre will allow the organization to expand its support of early-stage enterprises led by young people aged 18–35.[24]
 WE Charity implements development projects through its ""WE Villages"" program, formerly known as ""Adopt a Village"". The organization is active in rural China, Kenya,Tanzania, Sierra Leone, Haiti, India, Ethiopia and Ecuador. The WE Villages program is based on five ‘pillars’ of programming that work together to break the cycle of poverty: education, clean water and sanitation, health, opportunity, and food.[25]  These projects are designed to address the root causes of poverty and remove the barriers to children's education.[26]
 In July 2019, the organization opened its first WE College in Narok County, Kenya. It offered a range of courses to girls of Maasai Mara community.[27] Notable attendees of the opening ceremony included former Canadian First Lady Margaret Trudeau, Former Prime Minister of Canada Kim Campbell and The First Lady Margaret Kenyatta.[27]
 WE Charity works with thousands of schools and groups in Canada, the United States, and the U.K. through a program called WE Schools.[28]
 Students take part in activities such as food and clothing drives for the homeless[29], anti-bullying campaigns[30], and fundraisers to build water projects,[31] and schools[32] in countries where WE Charity works, including Kenya, India, and Ecuador. They also raise money for other organizations and causes, such as children’s hospitals, the Terry Fox Run9, and women’s shelters.[33]
 Charity Intelligence Canada reports that during the 2016-2017 school year, youth involved in the WE Schools program supported 7,221 organizations, collected 2,555,483 pounds of food, raised $24.2m, and volunteered for 8,837,826 hours. In a survey of teachers involved in WE Schools programming, 92% reported that students feel a stronger connection to their local community as a result of the program, and 89% reported that students are more likely to stand up for others who are discriminated against. [35]
 WE Day is the organization’s celebration of students who have participated in volunteer activities through the WE Schools program. Both WE Day and WE Schools programming are funded by corporate sponsors.[34]
 In 2017, WE Charity partnered with RBC to create a program called WE Are Social Entrepreneurs. The program involves events and workshops where students learn about social enterprise and pitch business ideas related to a social cause. Successful students earn a spot at “Incubation Week,” an extended training program on social entrepreneurship.[35]
 WE Charity holds an annual series of stadium-sized youth empowerment events called ""WE Day"", bringing together tens of thousands of students and educators as part of the yearlong WE Schools service learning program. WE Day has featured notable speakers, such as Al Gore, Elie Wiesel, Martin Luther King III,[36] Kofi Anan,[37] Prince Harry and Meghan Markle[38] and performers, such as Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, Lilly Singh[39], Jennifer Hudson, Liam Payne, Iskra Lawrence, Naomi Campbell[40]and Nelly Furtado.[41] Tickets are not purchased, but are instead earned by students through service in a local or a global cause. The first WE Day was staged in Toronto in October 2007. The program has since expanded into 17 cities, including London, Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles.[42]
 WE Charity works with schools and families in Canada, the United States, and the U.K. Its overarching program is called WE Schools, a year-long service-learning program. The program includes a team of Youth Programming Coordinators who mentor school and community youth groups; curriculum resources for elementary, middle, and high school classrooms; online resources; service campaigns; action kits; professional development sessions for teachers and motivational speaking tours and workshops.[43]
 A third party evaluation conducted by social impact measurement firm Mission Measurement found that youth participants in WE Charity programs are more interested and successful in school, more likely to vote, better working in teams, better role models to peers and siblings, better prepared for college and careers, and more confident in their ability to graduate from high school.[44]
 Charity Intelligence Canada reports that during the 2016-2017 school year, youth involved in the WE Schools program supported 7,221 organizations, collected 2,555,483 pounds of food, raised $24.2m, and volunteered for 8,837,826 hours. A survey on Canadian and American teachers in the program showed that 92% of teachers report that their students feel a stronger connection to their local community and 89% report that their students are more likely to stand up for others who are discriminated against.[45]
 WE Charity runs programs to educate Canadians on Indigenous history and culture. organization partners with the Martin Aboriginal Education Initiative to deliver the ""WE Stand Together"" campaign, promoted as strengthening ties between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Canada by emphasizing Canadian Indigenous history in classrooms.[46]
 Participating schools are provided with curricular resources to explore issues affecting Indigenous communities, including education, housing, medical care, the cost of food in northern communities, and preserving traditional knowledge.[47] WE Charity also invites Indigenous leaders to speak at WE Day events, including public figures like Olympian Waneek Horn-Miller, Justice Murray Sinclair, and actor Tom Jackson.[48]
 WE Charity is governed by separate Boards of Directors in Canada, the US and UK. The Canadian Board Chairwoman is Michelle Douglas, a Canadian human rights activist.[49] Board members are drawn from government, academia, business, media and charitable sectors.[50] Founders Craig and Marc Kielburger do not sit on the Board of Directors. 
 WE Charity also derives revenues through a partnership with social enterprise ME to WE. ME to WE sells ethical products including jewelry and chocolate, and international travel experiences in countries where WE Charity works. In 2017, 85% of the proceeds of ME to WE were donated to support WE Charity. The balance is reinvested in the social enterprise.[51] According to WE Charity’s website, its administration costs are 10% of total revenues and 90% of donations support its programming.[52]

 WE Charity's website lists the following companies as founding partners:[54]"
Wellcome Trust	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust	"The Wellcome Trust is a research charity based in London, United Kingdom. It was established in 1936 with legacies from the pharmaceutical magnate Sir Henry Wellcome to fund research to improve human and animal health. The aim of the Trust is to ""achieve extraordinary improvements in health by supporting the brightest minds"", and in addition to funding biomedical research it supports the public understanding of science. It had an endowment of £25.9 billion in 2018,[4] making it the fourth wealthiest charitable foundation in the world, after the American Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Danish Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Dutch INGKA Foundation (related to the IKEA company).
 The Trust has been described by the Financial Times as the United Kingdom's largest provider of non-governmental funding for scientific research, and one of the largest providers in the world.[6]
 The Trust was established to administer the fortune of the American-born pharmaceutical magnate Sir Henry Wellcome.[7] Its income was derived from what was originally called Burroughs Wellcome, later renamed in the UK as the Wellcome Foundation Ltd.[8] In 1986, the trust sold 25% of Wellcome plc stock to the public.  Overseen by incoming Director of Finance Ian Macgregor, this marked the beginning of a period of financial growth that saw the Trust's value increase by almost £14bn in 14 years, as their interests moved beyond the bounds of the pharmaceutical industry.[9]
 In 1995, the trust divested itself of any interest in pharmaceuticals by selling all remaining stock to Glaxo plc, the company's historic British rival, creating GlaxoWellcome plc. In 2000, the Wellcome name disappeared from the drug business altogether when GlaxoWellcome merged with SmithKline Beecham, to form GlaxoSmithKline plc.[10]
 The Trust funds or co-funds a number of major biomedical research initiatives:[11]
 Also known as SDDI, this five year initiative started in October 2005 with the remit ""to facilitate the development of drug-like small molecules that address unmet medical needs.""  SDDI was based in London and managed by Richard Davis.[14]  Through early 2010, SDDI had provided more than £80 million across 30 projects split between academic institutions and companies.[14]  To early 2010, all but one of the company recipients were either start-ups or spin-outs.[14]  In May 2010, an additional £110 million was added to the SDDI fund with the intent to extend the initiative for an additional 5 years.[15]
 The Wellcome Trust plays an important role in encouraging publication of research in open access repositories[16] such as Europe PubMed Central (EuropePMC). The Wellcome Trust believes that maximising the distribution of these papers - by providing free, online access - is the most effective way of ensuring that the research can be accessed, read and built upon. In turn, this will foster a richer research culture.[citation needed]
 In 2016, the Wellcome Trust partnered with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to launch the Open Science Prize[17] to ""help develop services, tools and platforms that enable open content to be discovered, assessed and re-used in ways that will advance discovery and spark innovation.""[17]
 In 2016, Wellcome Trust announced that it would be launching Wellcome Open Research,[18] an open access publication system running on the F1000 Research platform.[19] Article Processing Charges will be covered directly by Wellcome Trust. Paper from the system are now indexed in PubMed Central.[20]
 In the summer of 2015, the Wellcome Trust joined the Japanese government, 7 Japanese pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the United Nations Development Program as funding partner of the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT), which funds scientific research and development for anti-infectives and diagnostics for diseases that primarily affect the developing world.[21][22]
 In June 2007, the Wellcome Building reopened after refurbishment as a public venue, housing the Wellcome Collection, the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London and the Wellcome Library.[23] The aim of the Wellcome Collection is to enhance public understanding of medical science and history. The building contains gallery spaces, conference facilities, space for debates, drama and workshops, a café and a bookshop. The galleries show a small sample of works from Sir Henry Wellcome's collection, and host a programme of events and exhibitions. The Wellcome Collection and exhibitions are open to the public free of charge six days a week.[24]
 The Wellcome Collection and Wellcome Library are members of The London Museums of Health & Medicine.
 The Wellcome Trust sponsors an annual book prize, the Wellcome Book Prize, which ""aims to excite public interest and encourage debate"" around medicine and health.[25]
 In August 2014, the Wellcome Trust bought the Co-operative Group's farm business (renamed Farmcare) for £249 million. This comprised ""15,997 hectares (39,533 acres) of freehold and third party owned land, 15 farms, including three pack houses, over 100 residential properties, and 27 commercial properties.""[26]
 The Wellcome Trust's operations are run from two buildings on Euston Road in London. The Wellcome Building, at 183 Euston Road, built in 1932 in Portland stone houses the Wellcome Collection and the adjoining glass and steel building at 215 Euston Road is the Gibbs Building, by Hopkins Architects, which opened in 2004 as the administrative headquarters of the Wellcome Trust."
The Weston Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weston_Foundation	"The Weston Foundation is a Chicago-based private charitable trust established in 2007 by Roger L. Weston, former CEO of Greatbanc Inc., and is governed by a small trustee board that designates over 50 grants/yr ranging $500 – $10,000 in size. The Weston Foundation was created with the following mission: ""to promote the greatest good, with a particular emphasis on helping children, animal welfare, and the environment.""[1]
 Long-term projects of The Weston Foundation include:"
Wetlands International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetlands_International	"Wetlands International is a global organisation that works to sustain and restore wetlands and their resources for people and biodiversity. It is an independent, not-for-profit, global organisation, supported by government and NGO membership from around the world.
 Based mostly in the developing world, it has 20 regional, national or project offices in all continents and a head office in Ede, the Netherlands. 
 The NGO works in over 100 countries and at different scales to tackle problems affecting wetlands. With the support of dozens of governmental, NGO and corporate donors and partners, it supports about 80 projects[1].
 Wetlands International's work ranges from research and community-based field projects to advocacy and engagement with governments, corporate and international policy fora and conventions. Wetlands International works through partnerships and is supported by contributions from an extensive specialist expert network and thousands of volunteers.
 It was founded in 1937 as the International Wildfowl Inquiry and the organisation was focused on the protection of waterbirds. Later, the name became International Waterfowl & Wetlands Research Bureau (IWRB). The scope became wider; besides waterbirds, the organisation was also working on the protection of wetland areas.
 Later, organisations with similar objectives emerged in Asia and the Americas: the Asian Wetland Bureau (AWB) (initiated as INTERWADER in 1983) and Wetlands for the Americas (WA) (initiated in 1989). In 1991, the three organisations started to work closely together.  
 In 1995, the working relation developed into the global organisation Wetlands International.[2]
 Wetlands International works in many thematic areas throughout the world, including the links between peatlands and climate change, as well as wetlands and waterbird migration, based on extensive research as well as field projects.[3] It coordinates the International Waterbird Census, a large-scale citizen science project with decades of data[4]. 
 Currently, Wetlands International has four strong areas of work, which are:
 Wetlands International's peatlands work is focused in Eurasia and southeast Asia. The peatswamp forests of Central Kalimantan are studied and worked on in particular for climate mitigation[5]. The project Restoring peatlands in Russia is a joint-effort with the government and Greifeswald University, and was recognised by the UNFCCC with a Momentum for Change award in 2017, for storing up to 200,000 tonnes CO2e of carbon emissions every year by rewetting peatlands and preventing fires. [1]
 In the severely degraded peat lands of Central Kalimantan (Indonesia), drainage canals and logging have had disastrous impacts in an attempt to convert the unsuitable peatswamps into rice fields. By building small dams and blocks, the drainage of the area was stopped, preventing further oxidation of the peat soil. The area was then reforested with native tree species and community fire brigades to prevent the island's huge problem of peat fires.
 Previous work in China has included the Ruoergai marshes[6], and new work is looking at the Yellow Sea/Bohai migratory bird flyway[7]. Runoff from the glaciers in the Himalayas towards China’s lowland is regulated and stored in the Ruoergai marshes. The Wetlands International China office worked to have this peatland declared a Ramsar site, giving the Chinese government the obligation to protect the area. Furthermore, because of the work with the local Chinese authorities in measuring the impact of different management options, peat mining and drainage are now no longer allowed in Ruoergai and the neighbouring counties[8]. This also leads to improved water supply to the Yellow River and Yangtze River.
 
 In Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, the Wetlands International Latin America office built awareness of sustainable use of the peatlands from the local to the national level, which have contributed to their protection.
 Coastal wetlands such as mangrove forests and coral reefs reduce the impact of storms. Mangroves can even cope with sea-level rise and provide protection from impacts of waves.  
 In dryland regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, less rainfall and longer droughts increase the already huge importance of the Sahelian wetlands, and at the same time threaten overexploitation of these areas.
 Wetlands International works in Mali to improve the livelihoods and water provision of communities in the Inner Niger Delta in a changing climate.
 Wetlands International works to protect and restore the rich biodiversity of wetlands. Millions of waterbirds depend on wetlands like marshes, lakes and coastal zones[9]. Wetlands International coordinates an International Waterbird Census in most countries of the world outside the USA where it approximates to the Christmas Bird Count run by the Audubon Society. The census takes place in 143 countries, divided into five regions, visiting 15,000 sites over 60 years[10]. 
 Wetlands International promotes the establishment of ecological networks of well managed, protected wetlands, along the main flyway routes of migratory waterbirds. These wetlands provide stepping stones for migratory waterbirds; crucial for their survival. Wetlands International supports international governmental agreements to create these networks[11][12]."
Wikimedia Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation	"The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. (WMF, or simply Wikimedia) is an American non-profit and charitable organization headquartered in San Francisco, California.[7] It is mostly known for participating in the Wikimedia movement. It owns the internet domain names of most movement projects and hosts sites like Wikipedia. The foundation was founded in 2003 by Jimmy Wales as a way to fund Wikipedia and its sibling projects through non-profit means.[8][9]
 As of 2017[update], the foundation employs over 300 people, with annual revenues in excess of US$109.9 million.[10] María Sefidari is chair of the board.[3] Katherine Maher has been the executive director since March 2016.
 The Wikimedia Foundation has the stated goal of developing and maintaining open content, wiki-based projects and providing the full contents of those projects to the public free of charge.[11]  Another main objective of the Wikimedia Foundation is political advocacy.[12]
 The Wikimedia Foundation was granted section 501(c)(3) status by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code as a public charity in 2005.[13]  Its National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) code is B60 (Adult, Continuing education).[14][15] The foundation's by-laws declare a statement of purpose of collecting and developing educational content and to disseminate it effectively and globally.[16]
 In 2001, Jimmy Wales, an Internet entrepreneur, and Larry Sanger, an online community organizer and philosophy professor, founded Wikipedia as an Internet encyclopedia to supplement Nupedia. The project was originally funded by Bomis, Jimmy Wales's for-profit business. As Wikipedia's popularity increased, revenues to fund the project stalled.[8] Since Wikipedia was depleting Bomis's resources, Wales and Sanger thought of a charity model to fund the project.[8] The Wikimedia Foundation was incorporated in Florida on June 20, 2003.[9][17]  It applied to the United States Patent and Trademark Office to trademark Wikipedia on September 14, 2004. The mark was granted registration status on January 10, 2006. Trademark protection was accorded by Japan on December 16, 2004, and, in the European Union, on January 20, 2005. There were plans to license the use of the Wikipedia trademark for some products, such as books or DVDs.[18]
 The name ""Wikimedia"", a compound of wiki and media, was coined by American author Sheldon Rampton in a post to the English mailing list in March 2003,[19] three months after Wiktionary became the second wiki-based project hosted on Wales' platform.
 In April 2005, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service approved the foundation as an educational foundation in the category ""Adult, Continuing education"", meaning all contributions to the foundation are tax-deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 On December 11, 2006, the foundation's board noted that the corporation could not become the membership organization initially planned but never implemented due to an inability to meet the registration requirements of Florida statutory law. Accordingly, the by-laws were amended to remove all reference to membership rights and activities. The decision to change the bylaws was passed by the board unanimously.[20][9]
 On September 25, 2007, the foundation's board gave notice that the operations would be moving to the San Francisco Bay Area. Major considerations cited for choosing San Francisco were proximity to like-minded organizations and potential partners, a better talent pool, as well as cheaper and more convenient international travel than is available from St. Petersburg, Florida.[21][22][23] The move from Florida was completed by 31 January 2008 with the headquarters on Stillman Street in San Francisco.[24]
 In 2009, the Wikimedia Foundation's headquarters moved to New Montgomery Street.
 Lila Tretikov was appointed executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in May 2014.[25][26] She resigned in March 2016. Former chief communications officer Katherine Maher was appointed the interim executive director, a position made permanent in June 2016.
 In October 2017, the headquarters moved to San Francisco's One Montgomery Tower.[27]

This content is sourced from contributing volunteers and from resources with few or no copyright restrictions, such as copyleft material and works in the public domain.
 In addition to Wikipedia, the foundation operates eleven other wikis that follow the free content model with their main goal being the dissemination of knowledge. These include, by launch date:
 Several additional projects exist to provide infrastructure or coordination of the free knowledge projects. For instance, Outreach gives guidelines for best practices on encouraging the use of Wikimedia sites. These include:
 Wikimedia movement affiliates are independent, but formally recognized, groups of people intended to work together to support and contribute to the Wikimedia movement. The Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees has approved three active models for movement affiliates: chapters, thematic organizations, and user groups. Movement affiliates are intended to organize and engage in activities to support and contribute to the Wikimedia movement, such as regional conferences, outreach, edit-a-thons, hackathons, public relations, public policy advocacy, GLAM engagement, and Wikimania.[37][38][39]
 Recognition of a chapter and thematic organization is approved by the foundation's board. Recommendations on recognition of chapters and thematic organizations are made to the foundation's board by an Affiliations Committee, composed of Wikimedia community volunteers. The Affiliations Committee approves the recognition of individual user groups. While movement affiliates are formally recognized by the Wikimedia Foundation, they are independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, with no legal control of nor responsibility for the Wikimedia projects.[38][39][40]
 The foundation began recognizing chapters in 2004.[41] In 2010, development on additional models began. In 2012, the foundation approved, finalized, and adopted the thematic organization and user group recognition models. An additional model, movement partners, was also approved but as of 27 October 2015[update] has not yet been finalized or adopted.[37][39][42]
 Each year, an international conference called Wikimania brings the people together who are involved in the Wikimedia organizations and projects. The first Wikimania was held in Frankfurt, Germany, in 2005. Nowadays, Wikimania is organized by a committee supported usually by the national chapter, in collaboration with the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikimania has been held in cities such as Buenos Aires,[43] Cambridge,[44] Haifa,[45] Hong Kong,[46] and London.[47] In 2015, Wikimania took place in Mexico City,[48] in 2016 in Esino Lario, Italy,[49] 2017 in Montreal, 2018 in Cape Town, and 2019 in Stockholm.
 In response to the growing size and popularity of Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a Strategic Plan to improve and sustain the Wikimedia movement. The plan was announced in July 2009, followed by a process of interviews and surveys with people from across the Wikimedia movement, including board of trustees, members of staff and volunteer editors.[50] The ongoing plan was intended to be the basis of a five-year plan to further outreach, improve content quality and quality control, and optimising operational areas such as finance and infrastructure.[51]
 In December 2008, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a restricted donation grant of US$890,000 from the Stanton Foundation, to improve Wikipedia's accessibility.[52] Later named the Wikipedia Usability Initiative, the grant was used by the Wikimedia Foundation to appoint project-specific staff to the technology department.[53]
 A series of surveys were conducted throughout 2009. This began with a qualitative environment survey on MediaWiki extensions, followed by a Qualitative Statistical Survey focusing on volume of edits, number of new users, and related statistics. In March 2009, a usability and experience study was carried out on new and non-editors of the English Wikipedia. The aim was to discover what obstacles participants encountered while editing Wikipedia, ranging from small changes to more complicated syntax such as templates. The study recruited 2500 people for in-person laboratory testing via the Wikipedia website, which was filtered down to ten participants. The results were collated and used by the technology team to improve Wikipedia's usability.[54] The Usability and Experience Study was followed up by the Usability, Experience and Progress Study in September 2009. This study recruited different new and non-editors for in-person trials on a new Wikipedia skin.[55]
 The initiative ultimately culminated in a new Wikipedia skin named Vector, constructed based on the results of the usability studies. This was introduced by default in stages, beginning in May 2010.[56]
 In May 2010, the Wikimedia Foundation announced the Public Policy Initiative, following a US$1.2 million donation by the Stanton Foundation. The initiative was set up to improve articles relating to public policy issues.[57] As part of the initiative, Wikipedia collaborated with ten universities to help students and professors create and maintain articles relating to public policy.[58] Volunteer editors of Wikipedia, known as ""ambassadors"", provided assistance to students and professors. This was either done on campus sites or online.[59]
 In April 2017, the foundation was one of the founding partners in the Initiative for Open Citations.[60]
 The foundation employs technology including hardware and software to run its projects.
 Wikipedia employed a single server until 2004, when the server setup was expanded into a distributed multitier architecture.[61]
 In January 2005, the project ran on 39 dedicated servers[citation needed] in Florida.[62] This configuration included a single master database server running MySQL, multiple database servers, 21 web servers running the Apache HTTP Server, and seven Squid cache servers.[citation needed]
 By December 2009, Wikimedia ran on co-located servers, with 300 servers in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam.[63] Since 2008, it also switched from multiple different Linux operating system vendors to Ubuntu Linux.[64][65]
 By January 2013, Wikimedia transitioned to newer infrastructure in an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia; citing reasons of ""more reliable connectivity"" and ""fewer hurricanes"".[66][67] In years prior, the hurricane seasons had been cause of distress.[62]
 In October 2013, Wikimedia Foundation started looking for a second facility that would be used side-by-side with the main facility in Ashburn, citing reasons of redundancy (e.g. emergency fallback) and to prepare for simultaneous multi-datacentre service.[68][69] This follows the year in which a fiber cut caused the Wikimedia projects to be unavailable for one hour in August 2012.[70][71]
 Apart from the second facility for redundancy coming online in 2014,[72][73] the number of servers needed to run the infrastructure in a single facility has been mostly stable since 2009. As of November 2015, the main facility in Ashburn hosts 520 servers in total, which includes servers for newer services besides Wikimedia project wikis, such as Cloud Services (Toolforge), and various services for metrics, monitoring, and other system administration.[74]
 In 2017, Wikimedia Foundation deployed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia.[75]
 The operation of Wikimedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open-source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MariaDB database since 2013,[76] previously was using MySQL database.[77] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection. MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects.
 Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.
 Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of MediaWiki software. In April 2005, an Apache Lucene extension[78][79] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Currently Lucene Search 2.1,[80] which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3,[81] is used. The Wikimedia Foundation also uses CiviCRM[82] and WordPress.[83]
 The foundation published official Wikipedia mobile apps for Android and iOS devices and in March 2015, the apps were updated to include mobile user-friendly features.[84]
 The Wikimedia Foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.[85] It is exempt from federal income tax[85][86] and from state income tax.[85][87] It is not a private foundation, and contributions to it qualify as tax-deductible charitable contributions.[85]
 The continued technical and economic growth of each of the Wikimedia projects is dependent mostly on donations but the Wikimedia Foundation also increases its revenue by alternative means of funding such as grants, sponsorship, services and brand merchandising. The Wikimedia OAI-PMH update feed service, targeted primarily at search engines and similar bulk analysis and republishing, has been a source of revenue for several years,[85] but is no longer open to new customers.[88] DBpedia was given access to this feed free of charge.[89] In July 2014, the foundation announced it would be accepting Bitcoin donations.[90]
 Since the end of fiscal year ended 2004, the foundation's net assets have grown from US$57,000[91] to US$53.5 million at the end of fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.[92] Under the leadership of Sue Gardner, who joined the Wikimedia Foundation in 2007, the foundation's staff levels, number of donors and revenue have seen very significant growth.[93]
 In 2007, Charity Navigator gave Wikimedia an overall rating of three out of four possible stars[94] Charity Navigator gave three out of four possible stars in overall rating for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 which improved to four-stars in 2010.[95] As of December 2016, the overall rating was four stars.[96]
 The Wikimedia Foundation expenses mainly concern salaries, wages and other professional operating and services.[97]
 In 2008, the foundation received a US$40,000 grant by the Open Society Institute to create a printable version of Wikipedia.[98] It also received a US$262,000 grant by the Stanton Foundation to purchase hardware,[99] a US$500,000 unrestricted grant by Vinod and Neeru Khosla,[100] who later that year joined the foundation Advisory Board,[101] US$177,376 from the historians Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin foundation (Arcadia ), among others.[99] In March 2008, the foundation announced a large donation, at the time its largest donation yet: a three-year, US$3 million grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.[102]
 In 2009, the foundation received four grants – the first grant was a US$890,000 Stanton Foundation grant which was aimed to help study and simplify user interface for first-time authors of Wikipedia.[103] The second was a US$300,000 Ford Foundation grant, given in July 2009, for Wikimedia Commons that aimed to improve the interfaces and workflows for multimedia uploading on Wikimedia websites.[104] In August 2009, the foundation received a US$500,000 grant from The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.[105] Lastly, in August 2009, the Omidyar Network committed a US$2 million in grant to Wikimedia.[106]
 In 2010, Google donated US$2 million to the foundation.[107] The Stanton Foundation granted $1.2 million to fund the Public Policy Initiative, a pilot program for what would later become the Wikipedia Education Program (and the spinoff Wiki Education Foundation).[108][109][110] Also in 2010, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation pledged a US$800,000 grant and all was funded during 2011.[citation needed]
 In March 2011, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation authorized another US$3 million grant to continue to develop and maintain the foundation's mission. The grant was to be funded over three years with the first US$1 million funded in July 2011 and the remaining US$2 million was scheduled to be funded in August 2012 and 2013. As a major donor, Doron Weber from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation gained Board Visitor status at the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees.[111] In August 2011, the Stanton Foundation pledged to fund a US$3.6 million grant of which US$1.8 million was funded and the remaining was due to be funded in September 2012. As of 2011, this was the largest grant received by the Wikimedia Foundation to-date.[112] In November 2011, the foundation received a US$500,000 donation from Google co-founder Sergey Brin and his wife.[113][114]
 In 2012, the foundation was awarded a grant of US$1.25 million from the historians Lisbet Rausing[113] and Peter Baldwin through Charities Aid Foundation, scheduled to be funded in five equal installments. The first installment of US$250,000 was received in April 2012 and the remaining were to be funded in December 2012 through 2015. In 2014, the foundation received the largest single gift in its history, a $5 million unrestricted donation from an anonymous donor supporting $1 million worth of expenses annually for the next five years.[115] The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, a foundation established by Intel co-founder and his wife, awarded a US$449,636 grant to develop Wikidata.[116]
 Between 2014 and 2015, the foundation received US$500,000 from Monarch Fund, US$100,000 by Arcadia and an undisclosed amount by Stavros Niarchos Foundation to support the Wikipedia Zero initiative.[117][118][119]
 In 2015, a grant agreement was reached with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation to build a search engine called the ""Knowledge Engine"".[120][121]
 In 2017, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation awarded another US$3 million grant for a three-year period.[111]
 The foundation's board of trustees has ultimate authority of all the businesses and affairs of the foundation. It is composed of ten members:
 Three permanent entities support the board on its mission and responsibilities: an executive director, who leads and oversees the operational arm of the foundation; an advisory board composed of individuals selected by the board itself that advise the board on different matters; and standing committees to which the board delegates certain matters while retaining ultimate authority. The board has also at times created other orthodox entities[clarification needed] to support itself, such as executive secretaries and ad-hoc committees established for specific tasks.
 The current board comprises María Sefidari as chairman and Christophe Henner as vice-chairman, together with Tanya Capuano, Nataliia Tymkiv, Dariusz Jemielniak as members at-large, and Jimmy Wales in the ""founder's seat"" (installed as ""Community Founder Trustee Position"" to the WMF bylaws in August 2008).[132][133] James Heilman was appointed as a community selected trustee in August 2017.[134] Raju Narisetti, CEO of Gizmodo Media Group, was appointed trustee in October 2017,[135] and Bahraini human rights activist and blogger Esra'a Al Shafei idem in November 2017.[136]
 In a high-profile decision of 2015, James Heilman was removed from the board,[137][138] with little explanation.[137] (He returned in the Board in August 2017). In January 2016, Arnnon Geshuri briefly joined the board before stepping down from the board following a controversy about an agreement he executed when at Google, violating United States antitrust law. The participating companies paid US$415 million in a class action suit on behalf of affected employees.[139][140]
 The advisory board, according to the Wikimedia Foundation, is an international network of experts who have agreed to give the foundation meaningful help on a regular basis in many different areas, including law, organizational development, technology, policy, and outreach.[141]
 Appointed members for the period from June 16, 2017 to June 30, 2018 were:[142]
 In 2004, the foundation appointed Tim Starling as developer liaison to help improve the MediaWiki software, Daniel Mayer as chief financial officer (finance, budgeting, and coordination of fund drives), and Erik Möller as content partnership coordinator. In May 2005, the foundation announced seven more official appointments.[143]
 In January 2006, the foundation created several committees, including the Communication Committee, in an attempt to further organize activities essentially handled by volunteers at that time.[144] Starling resigned that month to spend more time on his PhD program.
 The foundation's functions were, for the first few years, executed almost entirely by volunteers. In 2005, it had only two employees, Danny Wool, a coordinator, and Brion Vibber, a software manager.
 As of October 4, 2006[update], the foundation had five paid employees:[145] two programmers, an administrative assistant, a coordinator handling fundraising and grants, and an interim executive director,[146] Brad Patrick, previously the foundation's general counsel. Patrick ceased his activity as interim director in January 2007, and then resigned from his position as legal counsel, effective April 1, 2007. He was replaced by Mike Godwin, who served as general counsel and legal coordinator from July 2007[147] until 2010.
 In January 2007, Carolyn Doran was named chief operating officer and Sandy Ordonez joined as head of communications.[148] Doran began working as a part-time bookkeeper in 2006 after being sent by a temporary agency. Doran, found to have had a long criminal record,[149] left the foundation in July 2007, and Sue Gardner was hired as consultant and special advisor (later CEO). Doran's departure from the organization was cited by Florence Devouard as one of the reasons the foundation took about seven months to release its fiscal 2007 financial audit.[150]
 Danny Wool, officially the grant coordinator but also largely involved in fundraising and business development, resigned in March 2007. He accused Wales of misusing the foundation's funds for recreational purposes, and said that Wales had his Wikimedia credit card taken away in part because of his spending habits, a claim Wales denied.[151] In February 2007, the foundation added a new position, chapters coordinator, and hired Delphine Ménard,[152] who had been occupying the position as a volunteer since August 2005. Cary Bass was hired in March 2007 in the position of volunteer coordinator. Oleta McHenry was brought in as accountant in May 2007, through a temporary placement agency and made the official full-time accountant in August 2007. In January 2008, the foundation appointed Veronique Kessler as the new chief financial and operating officer, Kul Wadhwa as head of business development, and Jay Walsh as head of communications.
 As of June 16, 2017,[update] the foundation had approximately 280 employees and contractors.[6]
 Many disputes have resulted in litigation[153][154][155][156] while others have not.[157] Attorney Matt Zimmerman stated, ""Without strong liability protection, it would be difficult for Wikipedia to continue to provide a platform for user-created encyclopedia content.""[158]
 In December 2011, the foundation hired Washington, DC, lobbyist Dow Lohnes Government Strategies LLC to lobby the United States Congress with regard to ""Civil Rights/Civil Liberties"" and ""Copyright/Patent/Trademark.""[159] At the time of the hire the Foundation was concerned specifically about a bill known as the Stop Online Piracy Act.[160]
 In October 2013, a German Court ruled that the Wikimedia Foundation can be held liable for content added to Wikipedia – however, this applies only when there has been a specific complaint; otherwise, the Wikimedia Foundation does not check any of the content published on Wikipedia and has no duty to do so.[161]
 In June 2014, a copyright infringement lawsuit was filed by Bildkonst Upphovsrätt i Sverige against Wikimedia Sweden.[162]
 On June 20, 2014, a defamation lawsuit (Law Division civil case No. L-1400-14) involving Wikipedia editors was filed with the Mercer County Superior Court in New Jersey seeking, inter alia, compensatory and punitive damages.[163][164]
 In a March 10, 2015, op-ed for The New York Times, Wales and Tretikov announced the foundation was filing a lawsuit against the National Security Agency, calling into question its practice of mass surveillance, which they argued infringed the constitutional rights of the foundation's readers, editors and staff.[165][166][167] On October 23, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland dismissed the suit Wikimedia Foundation v. NSA on grounds of standing. US District Judge T. S. Ellis III ruled that the plaintiffs could not plausibly prove they were subject to upstream surveillance, and that their argument is riddled with assumptions, speculations and mathematical gymnastics.[168][169] The plaintiffs filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on February 17, 2016.[170]
 In February 2016, Lila Tretikov announced her resignation as executive director, as a result of the WMF's controversial Knowledge Engine project and disagreements with the staff.[171][172]
 In January 2016, the foundation announced the creation of an endowment to ensure the continuity of the project in the future. The Wikimedia Endowment was established as a collective action fund at the Tides Foundation and its goal is to raise US$100 million in the next 10 years.[173] Craig Newmark was one of the initial donors, giving US$1 million to the endowment.[174] In 2018, Amazon.com and Facebook gave US$1 million each and George Soros donated $2 million to the endowment.[175][176][177] In January 2019, Google donated $2 million to the endowment.[178] In 2019, Peter Baldwin and his wife, Lisbet Rausing, have donated an additional $3.5 million to the Endowment. The gift brings their total Endowment giving to $8.5 million, building upon the $5 million they gave in 2017.[5]
 During the 2015 fundraising campaign, some members of the community voiced their concerns about the fundraising banners. They argued that they were obtrusive for users and that they could be deceiving potential donors by giving the perception that Wikipedia had immediate financial issues, which was not the case. The Wikimedia Foundation vowed to improve wording on further fundraising campaigns to avoid these issues.[179]
 In June 2015, James Heilman was elected by the community to the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees.[180] In December 2015, the Board removed Heilman from his position as a Trustee,[181][182] a decision that generated substantial controversy amongst members of the Wikipedia community.[137] A statement released by the board declared the lack of confidence of his fellow trustees in him as the reasons for his ouster. Heilman later stated that he ""was given the option of resigning [by the Board] over the last few weeks. As a community elected member I see my mandate as coming from the community which elected me and thus declined to do so. I saw such a move as letting down those who elected me.""[183] He subsequently pointed out that while on the Board, he had pushed for greater transparency regarding the Wikimedia Foundation's controversial Knowledge Engine project and its financing,[184] and indicated that his attempts to make public the Knight Foundation grant for the engine had been a factor in his dismissal.[185]
 The volunteer community re-elected him to the Wikimedia Foundation board in 2017.[186]
 Knowledge Engine was a search engine project initiated in 2015 by the WMF to locate and display verifiable and trustworthy information on the Internet.[187] The goal of the KE was to be less reliant on traditional search engines and it was funded with a US$250,000 grant from the Knight Foundation.[188] The project was perceived as a scandal, mainly because it was conceived in secrecy, which was perceived as a conflict with the Wikimedia community's transparency. In fact, most of the information available to the community was received through leaked documents published by The Signpost in 2016.[189][187]
 Following this controversy, Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director Lila Tretikov resigned.[190]
 Wales was confronted with allegations that the WMF had ""a miserable cost/benefit ratio and for years now has spent millions on software development without producing anything that actually works"".[186] Wales acknowledged in 2014 that he had ""been frustrated as well about the endless controversies about the rollout of inadequate software not developed with sufficient community consultation and without proper incremental rollout to catch show-stopping bugs"".[186]
 In 2017, an op-ed published by The Signpost, English Wikipedia online newspaper, titled Wikipedia has Cancer[191] produced a heated debate both in the Wikipedian community and the wider public. The author criticized the Wikimedia Foundation for its ever-increasing annual spending which, he argued, could put the project at financial risk should an unexpected event happen. The author proposed to put a cap on spending, build up its existing endowment, and restructure the endowment so that the WMF cannot dip into the principal when times get bad.  Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director, Katherine Maher responded by pointing out that such an endowment was already created in 2016, confusing creating an endowment with building up an existing endowment.[192] As of January 2019 the WMF can still dip into the principal if times get bad.

WildAid	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WildAid	"WildAid is an environmental organization based in San Francisco, California, United States. 
 WildAid focuses on reducing the demand for wildlife products. WildAid works with Asian and Western celebrities and business leaders to dissuade people from purchasing wildlife products via public service announcements and educational initiatives, reaching up to approximately one billion people per week in China alone.[citation needed]
 WildAid operates a field program in the Galapagos Islands, protecting the Galápagos Marine Reserve, apprehending poachers and smugglers and creating economic alternatives to local communities. WildAid works with media, governments, celebrities and local partners and communities worldwide to make wildlife conservation a global priority.
 WildAid's original name was Global Survival Network (GSN), which focused on countering wildlife and human trafficking.  GSN was founded and directed by Steven Galster, and one of its main supporter was Suwanna Gauntlett.  At GSN, Peter Knights ran a successful program to reduce demand for wildlife.  In 2000, Galster, Gauntlett, Knights and a colleague of theirs, Steve Trent, teamed up to strengthen GSN, focus it on the environment, and re-branded it ""WildAid"".  Eventually, WildAid's four co-directors split up and formed four different organizations with different areas of focus: Galster formed Freeland.  Knights maintained directorship of WildAid.  Gauntlett formed Wildlife Alliance.  And Trent formed Environmental Justice Foundation.  Today, WildAid works in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Indonesia, India, and Ecuador with headquarters in San Francisco, California.
 Yao Ming, Jackie Chan, Leonardo DiCaprio, Harrison Ford, Jane Goodall, Kate Hudson, and Amitabh Bachchan are among their celebrity ambassadors.[1] In 2017, Jackie Chan made a public service announcement called WildAid: Jackie Chan & Pangolins (Kung Fu Pangolin)[2]
 Charity Navigator gives the organization a financial rating of 4 out of 4 stars and a transparency rating of 4 out of 4 stars.[3]"
Wildlife Conservation Society	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_Conservation_Society	"Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS)  was founded in 1895 as the New York Zoological Society (NYZS) and currently works to conserve more than two million square miles of wild places around the world. The organization is led by President and CEO Cristián Samper, former Director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. Based at the Bronx Zoo, WCS maintains approximately 500 field conservation projects in 65 countries, with 200 PhD scientists on staff. It manages four New York City wildlife parks in addition to the Bronx Zoo: the Central Park Zoo, New York Aquarium, Prospect Park Zoo and Queens Zoo. Together these parks receive 4 million visitors per year.[1] All of the New York City facilities are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).[2]
 The Wildlife Conservation Society was originally chartered by the state of New York on April 26, 1895. Then known as the New York Zoological Society, the organization embraced a mandate to advance wildlife conservation, promote the study of zoology, and create a first-class zoological park. Its name was changed to the Wildlife Conservation Society in 1993. Among the founders of WCS were Andrew H. Green, best known as the father of greater New York City, Henry Fairfield Osborn, Columbia University professor and curator of the American Museum of Natural History, and George Bird Grinnell, founder of the Audubon Society and editor of Forest and Stream Magazine. Theodore Roosevelt, Madison Grant, members of the Boone and Crockett Club, and other notable New Yorkers were also involved in the Society's creation.
 The Bronx Zoo (formerly the New York Zoological Park) was designed along the lines of other cultural institutions in New York City, such as the American Museum of Natural History. The city provided the land for the new zoo and some funding for buildings and annual operating costs. WCS raised most of the funds for construction and operations from a private donor, and selected the scientific and administrative personnel.
 In the late nineteenth century William Temple Hornaday, then director of the New York Zoological Park (now the Bronx Zoo), carried out a direct-mail survey of wildlife conditions through the United States, and publicized the decline of birds and mammals in the organization's annual reports. In 1897 Hornaday also hired field researcher Andrew J. Stone to survey the condition of wildlife in the territory of Alaska. On the basis of these studies, Hornaday led the campaign for new laws to protect the wildlife there and the United States as a whole. In 1901, a small herd of American Bison were gathered in a 20-acre meadow just off what is now the Pelham Parkway roadway. Starting in 1905, Hornaday led a national campaign to reintroduce the almost extinct bison to government sponsored refuges.[3][4] Hornaday, Theodore Roosevelt and others formed the American Bison Society in 1905. The Bronx Zoo sent 15 bison to Wichita Reserve in 1907 and additional bison in later years. The saving of this uniquely American symbol is one of the great success stories in the history of wildlife conservation. Hornaday campaigned for wildlife protection throughout his thirty years as director of the Bronx Zoo.
 William Beebe, the first curator of birds at the Bronx Zoo, began a program of field research soon after the Bronx Zoo opened. His research on wild pheasants took him to Asia from 1908 to 1911 and resulted in a series of books on pheasants. Beebe's field work also resulted in the creation of the Society’s Department of Tropical Research, which Beebe directed from 1922 until his retirement in 1948. Beebe’s research in an undersea vessel called the bathysphere took him half a mile under the ocean floor off Bermuda in 1934 to record for the first time human observations of the bottom of the deep sea. The bathysphere is currently displayed at the New York Aquarium.
 The war years marked the arrival of Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr as NYZS president and Laurance Rockefeller as executive committee chairman. A best selling writer on conservation and son of WCS founder Henry Fairfield Osborn, Osborn soon embraced changes that signaled new thinking in the organization. Guests were allowed to bring their own cameras into the Bronx Zoo, while animals were grouped by continents and ecosystems rather than genetic orders and families, beginning with the African Plains exhibit in 1941.[5]
 After World War II, under the leadership of Osborn, the organization extended its programs in field biology and conservation. In 1946 WCS helped found the Jackson Hole Wildlife Park, which became part of Grand Teton National Park in 1962. In the late 1950s WCS began a series of wildlife surveys and projects in Kenya, Tanganyika (now Tanzania), Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, Burma, and the Malay peninsula. In 1959 it sponsored George Schaller’s seminal study of mountain gorillas in Congo. Since that expedition, Schaller has gone on to become the world's preeminent field biologist, studying wildlife throughout Africa, Asia and South America. Conservation activities continued to expand under the leadership of William G. Conway, who became director of the Bronx Zoo in 1962 and President of WCS in 1992. Active as a field biologist in Patagonia, Conway promoted a new vision of zoos as conservation organizations, which cooperated in breeding endangered species. He also designed new types of zoo exhibits aimed at teaching visitors about habitats that support wildlife, and encouraged the expansion of WCS's field programs.
 During the 1960s and 1970s, the WCS took a leadership role in pioneering zoological exhibitions by seeking to recreate natural environments for the animals on display. Under the leadership of WCS director William G. Conway, the Bronx Zoo opened its World of Darkness for nocturnal species in 1969 and its World of Birds for avian displays in 1974.[6] Eventually New York City turned to WCS to renew and manage three city-run facilities in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. The redesigned Central Park Zoo opened in 1988, followed by the Queens Zoo in 1992 and the Prospect Park Zoo in 1993.[7] From 1994 through 1996 Archie Carr III of WCS helped establish the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, a reserve for endangered jaguar.
 Today WCS is at work on some 500 projects in more than 60 nations around the world that are intended to help protect both wildlife and the wild places in which they live.[8] The organization endeavors to protect 25 percent of the world's biodiversity—from the gorillas of Africa and the tigers of Asia to macaws in South America and the sharks, whales and turtles traveling through the planet's seas. In recent years WCS has actively worked in conflict areas like Afghanistan, South Sudan and Myanmar, where agreements on wildlife resource have contributed to peace and stability. More than 4 million people visit WCS's wildlife parks in New York City each year.[9]
 The Welikia Project[10] is a project by the WCS to reconstruct and map how Manhattan looked in 1609 when Henry Hudson discovered the island. Elements being mapped include where the streams flowed and where each species of tree grew.[11] The Lenni Lenape people who lived there called the island Mannahatta, or ""land of many hills."" The project highlights the ways that development has altered the natural ecosystems.[12]
 In 2001, in collaboration with the Madagascar Ministry of Environment and Forests, the WCS launched a program to create the 372,470 hectare Makira Forest Protected Area.[13] In 2017, WCS partnered with carbon-reduction platform Cool Effect to allow users to fund ongoing carbon-reduction projects directly supporting the Makira Natural Park.

 Notes"
William and Flora Hewlett Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_and_Flora_Hewlett_Foundation	"The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, commonly known as the Hewlett Foundation, is a private foundation, established by Hewlett-Packard cofounder William Redington Hewlett and his wife Flora Lamson Hewlett in 1966.[3]  The Hewlett Foundation awards grants to a variety of liberal and progressive causes, as well as conservative organizations. [4][5]
 With assets of approximately $10 billion, Hewlett is one of the wealthiest grant makers in the United States.[2][6] The Foundation has grantmaking programs in education, the environment, global development and population, the performing arts, and philanthropy. The Hewlett Foundation is based in Menlo Park, California.
 In 2001, the foundation gave $400 million to Stanford University for humanities, sciences, and undergraduate education. At the time, the gift was the largest on record to a university.[7] In 2007, the Hewlett Foundation made a $113 million donation to the University of California at Berkeley to create 100 new endowed professorships and provide financial help for graduate students.[8]
 In May 2010, the Hewlett Foundation announced its strategy of ""Deeper Learning"", which is a set of student educational outcomes including acquisition of robust core academic content, higher-order thinking skills, and learning dispositions. 
 Hewlett and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation helped to develop the field of OpenCourseWare.[9]
Hewlett seeded the Creative Commons project with $1 million.[10]
 In 2008, the foundation awarded the Climate Works Foundation approximately $460,800,000.[11] Hewlett funded restoration of the Bay Area Salt Ponds[12] and conservation of the Great Bear Rainforest in Canada.[13]
 Hewlett's Environment Program makes grants to support conservation in the North American West, reduce global warming and conventional pollution resulting from the use of fossil fuels, and promote environmental protection efforts in California. The Hewlett Foundation opposes coal and natural gas development[5]. However, the Hewlett Foundation is a donor to the Breakthrough Institute,[14]
 Hewlett collaborated with the Center for Investigative Reporting to create California Watch, an investigative reporting project focused on California news.[15]
 The Hewlett Foundation make grants in developing countries and in the United States to provide and advocate for family planning and reproductive health services.[16] The Hewlett Foundation has given major financial support to Planned Parenthood and the International Planned Parenthood Federation.[17][18][19]
 The following table lists the top sectors to which the Hewlett Foundation has committed funding within its Global Development and Population Program. Data are taken from the International Aid Transparency Initiative activities publication, and is expected to cover 21% of the foundation's overall grantmaking; this does not include international grantmaking in Environment, Education, and other program areas, although those total a significant proportion of grants.  The Foundation's Climate Initiative, in particular, is oriented toward international as well as U.S.-focused work.[20] The sector names use the DAC 3 Digit Sector names.[21]
 The following table lists the all-time top 30 grantees, as recorded in the IATI activities publication."
The Winnipeg Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winnipeg_Foundation	"The Winnipeg Foundation is a registered charity based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.  It was established in 1921 and is Canada's oldest community foundation. The Foundation is dedicated primarily to the social improvement of Winnipeg, Manitoba. It pools and permanently invests gifts from donors from all walks of life to support the local charitable sector, through grants in a broad range of areas, including; community service, education and employment, health, environment, heritage, arts and culture, and recreation.[1]
 In 2014 the Winnipeg Foundation made $22.9 million in grants to 860 charitable organizations.[2]
 The Winnipeg Foundation was founded in 1921 with a gift of $100,000 from local businessman and banker, William Forbes Alloway. In 2001, the Foundation experienced an unprecedented gift when it received a $100 million donation  - at the time it was the largest gift ever made to a Canadian community foundation - from Randall Moffat and his family. Moffat is the former president of Moffat Communications. In 2003, The Winnipeg Foundation made its largest grant to date ($6 million) to the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.[3]  In 2012, The Winnipeg Foundation surpassed $300 million in total cumulative grants.[4]"
Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson_National_Fellowship_Foundation	"The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation[1] is a private non-profit operating foundation based in Princeton, New Jersey. It administers programs that support leadership development and build organizational capacity in education. Its current signature program is the Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship. Fellowships are granted to develop human resources, improve public policy, and help different organizations and institutions in enhancing practice in the United States as well as other countries worldwide.
 The first Woodrow Wilson Fellowships were created by Dr. Whitney ""Mike"" Oates, a Princeton University classics professor who served in the Marine Corps during World War II. During his tour of duty, Professor Oates realized that many of his brightest undergraduates who had served in the armed forces were unlikely to go on to doctoral study and college teaching careers when the war was over. As the G.I. Bill[2] took shape, however, it was clear that college enrollments would expand, and the ranks of qualified college instructors must grow.
 Oates and the Princeton graduate dean, Sir Hugh Taylor,[3] developed a program of fellowships funded by various individual donors to help recruit veterans to Princeton's Ph.D. programs in the humanities. In 1945, these fellowships were combined into one program and named for Woodrow Wilson, a champion of teaching and of graduate studies during his tenure as president of Princeton. The Woodrow Wilson Fellowships provided full funding for Ph.D. studies, with the proviso that recipients plan a career in college teaching.
 Other universities and national funders began to recognize the importance of recruiting future college professors. In 1947, Carnegie Corporation of New York[4] provided $100,000 to expand the program to selected universities nationwide. Gradually the program broadened to extend eligibility beyond veterans, in fields other than the humanities. In 1951 the Fellowship program was placed under the administration of the Association of Graduate Schools. In the same year, the first women were granted Woodrow Wilson Fellowships.
 In 1953 Robert F. Goheen,[5] who had been one of the first four Woodrow Wilson Fellows in 1945, became national director of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Program, expanding the program to 200 fellowships nationally.  Over the next several years, other funders, including the Rockefeller Foundation,[6] also supported the program.
 In 1957, the Ford Foundation[7] provided a five-year, $24.5 million grant to support up to 1,000 Woodrow Wilson Fellowships annually, and the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation was independently incorporated.  Fellowships were offered across the range of arts and sciences. Overall, during the following decade—including two renewal grants, in 1962 and 1966—the Fellowships received $52 million in Ford Foundation support, providing both awards to Fellows and supplemental support to the graduate schools hosting them.
 Throughout these years, a rigorous interview process was the hallmark of the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship. Professors nominated or recommended promising seniors, and applications underwent review at the Foundation, with finalists examined by regional panels on campuses around the country. A 1960 TIME magazine article proclaimed, ""The Woodrow Wilson Fellowship is fast becoming a domestic version of the Rhodes Scholarship.""[8]
 Foundation policies stipulated that candidates could not hold both the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship and other, similar fellowships for doctoral study. Some candidates, after successfully completing the intensive interviews, declined the Woodrow Wilson Fellowships to accept Rhodes Scholarships,[9] National Science Foundation[10] fellowships, and other such awards. These candidates were allowed designation as honorary Woodrow Wilson Fellows.
 In addition to the full Woodrow Wilson Fellowships, various complementary awards were offered during the 1960s and early 1970s. These included Woodrow Wilson Dissertation Fellowships, offered to supplement the original award for Fellows who required dissertation support; Teaching and Administrative Internships, designed to engage graduate students and young administrators with the nation's historically black colleges and universities; and Martin Luther King, Jr. Fellowships, specifically intended for African American veterans of the armed forces. The mix of a signature fellowship with complementary programs to create access and capacity in the nation's education system became a pattern for later Woodrow Wilson Foundation activities.
 By the early 1970s full funding for the Woodrow Wilson Fellowships had diminished, and, over the concluding several years of the program, the Foundation reduced both the number and amount of awards. By the time the original Woodrow Wilson Fellowship program ended, nearly 18,000 Fellows had been named. Woodrow Wilson Fellows went on to receive 13 Nobel Prizes, 35 MacArthur ""genius grants,"" 11 Pulitzer Prizes, 21 Presidential Medals, and many other awards.
 As the original large-scale Woodrow Wilson Fellowships came to an end, the Foundation still sought to provide opportunity in higher education for specific groups of students. Following a precedent set by some of the Foundation's earlier supplementary fellowships, the Woodrow Wilson Dissertation Fellowship in Women's Studies, created in 1974, not only bolstered the growth of feminist scholarship across the humanities and social sciences, but also supported primarily women scholars completing Ph.D.s in these fields at a time when women were significantly underrepresented in doctoral study.
 In the 1980s and 1990s the Woodrow Wilson Foundation continued to encourage work in targeted academic disciplines. The Charlotte W. Newcombe Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship, funded by the Charlotte W. Newcombe Foundation, still supports completion of Ph.D. work on ethical or religious values in any field of the humanities or social sciences. Other Woodrow Wilson programs created during the 1980s and 1990s to strengthen specific academic fields included the Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship in the Humanities (1982–2006) and the Spencer Dissertation Fellowships in Education (1987–1992).
 During the same period, the Foundation also established fellowships in higher education  to encourage preparation for specific national high-need fields such as women's health.
 From time to time Woodrow Wilson fellowships have also provided support for individuals at particular stages of their careers in higher education, such as the Millicent McIntosh Fellowships for Recently Tenured Faculty and the Woodrow Wilson Academic Postdoctoral Fellowships in the Humanities.
 During the years after the original Woodrow Wilson Fellowships, the Foundation also launched various programs to cultivate and support teachers at the middle- and high-school levels, as well as in college. The earliest of these was the Woodrow Wilson Teacher Fellowship (1974–1981). Though limited in scope, serving just 42 teachers, it paved the way for the subsequent Leadership Program for Teachers (1982–2003), which brought more than 2,400 teachers into summer enrichment programs with university faculty. The related  Woodrow Wilson National Network of Seminars for Teachers, begun in 1999 as Teachers as Scholars, also offers professional development, bringing teachers back to university campuses for intensive seminars in their disciplines with leading arts and sciences faculty. These programs would serve as precursors to the more recent Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship.
 Some of the earliest work of the initial Woodrow Wilson Fellowships required building new networks and capacities in higher education. Subsequent programs made this focus on organizational capacity more explicit.
 In the 1970s, the Rockefeller Foundation and other funders supported a program of Woodrow Wilson Teaching and Administrative Internships that brought graduate students to historically black colleges and universities, seeking both to strengthen HBCUs' faculty and to provide these young scholars and leaders with campus-based experience.
 A separate program of the same era, the Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellows, created a ""speakers bureau"" that brought national leaders in for week-long residencies on small campuses at a distance from major metropolitan areas, working one-on-one and in small groups with students and faculty. The Council of Independent Colleges now manages this ongoing program.
 During the 1990s, troubled by the apparent and growing mismatch between liberal arts doctoral education and the academic and nonacademic job markets, the Foundation created a suite of programs that included the Humanities at Work and the Responsive Ph.D. The former sought both to widen potential nonacademic employers' understanding of the skills offered by individuals with doctoral-level humanities backgrounds and, within the academy, to encourage both graduate students' and faculty's appreciation for the role of the humanities in a larger socioeconomic context. The related Responsive Ph.D. initiative created a network of institutions committed to rethinking graduate education in a way that aligned doctoral graduates' preparation more fully with the academic careers awaiting them.
 As in its individual work with K-12 teachers, the Foundation also, in the early 2000s, turned its attention to building networks and capacity among high schools. Through the Woodrow Wilson Early College Initiative, supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Foundation drew on its higher education networks to create small middle and high schools through a series of school-university partnerships. These schools—part of a national Early College network serving high-need, low-income students—created models for preparing all students in a school to attend and graduate college. The WW Early College strategy includes dual enrollment, academic rigor, practical skills coaching, and on-campus experience.
 In 2007, under the new leadership of Arthur Levine, the board and staff of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation reassessed the organization's connection to national needs in education. The Foundation concluded that the achievement gap was perhaps the nation's most urgent education need, not only at the K-12 level but also for institutions of higher education, which are dependent on college-ready students, and for society at large, which requires a well-educated, sophisticated workforce drawn from all socioeconomic backgrounds.
 Based on numerous studies indicating that the presence of a well-prepared teacher is the single most important factor in student achievement, the Foundation created the Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship to serve as its signature program for the near- to mid-term. The Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship is intended to recruit exceptionally well-qualified individuals into teaching in high-need urban and rural secondary schools, as well as to transform the way in which they are prepared to teach.
 The WW Teaching Fellowship was launched in 2007 in two versions.[11] One version funded by the Annenberg Foundation,[12] the Leonore Annenberg Teaching Fellowship, was implemented at four selected national universities—Stanford University and the Universities of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington—that showcase excellence in teacher preparation. In the other, state-based model, Fellows enroll in an intensive master's-level teacher preparation program at one of a designated group of universities. The universities, in exchange for receiving exceptional teacher candidates and a matching grant, agree to rethink their teacher preparation programs, emphasizing classroom experience from the early phases of the program. A third related program, the Woodrow Wilson-Rockefeller Brothers Fund Fellowship for Aspiring Teachers of Color, was transferred to the Woodrow Wilson Foundation in 2009 by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. Fellows across all three programs receive $30,000 stipends and enroll in teacher preparation programs designated by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation.
 The state-based model of the WW Teaching Fellowship was first implemented as the Woodrow Wilson Indiana Teaching Fellowship in December 2007 with the support of Lilly Endowment[13] and Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels. Two additional states, Michigan and Ohio, signed on in late 2009 and 2010, creating, respectively, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation's  Woodrow Wilson Michigan Teaching Fellowship, endorsed by Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm, and the Woodrow Wilson Ohio Teaching Fellowship,[14] endorsed by Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and supported by the Ohio Board of Regents' Choose Ohio First program, with additional funds from a statewide group of private philanthropies. The Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio programs all focus specifically on teacher preparation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, also known as the STEM fields.
 The first group of Woodrow Wilson Indiana Teaching Fellows completed the first phase of their work in summer 2010. The Michigan and Ohio programs will name their first classes in 2011. Other states are in discussion about creating similar programs. President Barack Obama cited the Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship as a model of STEM teacher preparation[15] in a January 2010 speech focused on his administration's Educate to Innovate initiative.
 In addition to its teacher preparation activities, the Woodrow Wilson Foundation continues to offer a suite of fellowships that prepare emerging scholars and leaders for success in the American academy and in several high-need fields. These include the Woodrow Wilson Dissertation Fellowship in Women's Studies, the Charlotte W. Newcombe Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship, and others. Funds for general studies beyond the scope of these programs are not available from the Woodrow Wilson Foundation.
 The Foundation also continues its capacity-building work in high schools, building on expertise developed with the Woodrow Wilson Early Colleges. Seventeen schools currently exist in the formal Woodrow Wilson Early College network, with another half-dozen schools and districts partnering with Woodrow Wilson to implement the approach in various ways.
 The president of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation is Arthur Levine, former president of Teachers College, Columbia University. The 35-member Woodrow Wilson Board of Trustees is chaired by Walter W. Buckley, Jr., co-founder and president of Buckley Muething Capital Management. Incorporated as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, the Woodrow Wilson Foundation is an operating foundation supported by a range of public and private funders."
World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Association_of_Girl_Guides_and_Girl_Scouts	"The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS /wæɡz/) is a global association supporting the female-oriented and female-only Guiding and Scouting organizations in 150 countries. It was established in 1928 in Parád, Hungary, and has its headquarters in London, England. It is the counterpart of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). WAGGGS is organized into five regions and operates five international Guiding centers. It holds full member status in the European Youth Forum (YFJ), which operates within the Council of Europe and European Union areas and works closely with these bodies.
 The mission of the WAGGGS is to enable girls and young women to develop their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world.
 WAGGGS provides a non-formal educational program that provides training in life skills, leadership and decision making. It also offers projects and programs at an international level that enable Girl Guides and Girl Scouts to be responsible world citizens through action and activity in the community.
 WAGGGS is run by women for girls and young women. Girl Guides and Girl Scouts are trained in leadership and decision-making, and are encouraged to participate in the governance and leadership of WAGGGS. Each individual unit is democratically run with Girl Guides and Girl Scouts actively involved in leadership and in decision making.
 Girl Guiding/Girl Scouting is open to all girls and young women without distinction of creed, race, nationality, or any other circumstance. WAGGGS believes that the education of girls, and the education of boys, includes education for equal partnership. Young men and young women are taught to recognize their differences and their similarities, and to respect each other as individuals.
 Girl Guiding/Girl Scouting is a voluntary organisation that relies on over 100,000 volunteers around the world to implement programs for Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, and to give girls and young women support and leadership. There are over 10 million Girl Guides and Girl Scouts in 145 countries. Girl Guides and Girl Scouts from around the world can meet each other at international events at one of the four World Centers.
 There are many opportunities to attend international events run by the United Nations or other non-governmental organizations on behalf of the Association. The WOSM is the non-governmental organization (NGO), that represents the Scouting movement at the United Nations.[1] The WOSM and WAGGGS both have General Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.[2]
 Girl Guiding/Girl Scouting is based on a core set of values that are found in the Girl Guide/Girl Scout Promise and Law. Each Girl Guide and Girl Scout promises to do her best to her faith and to others, and in so doing she realizes her fullest potential as a responsible citizen.
 Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting uses non-formal educational methods. Non-formal education is organized educational activity outside schools and colleges. The key components of non-formal education are that:
 Each Guide/Girl Scout defines her own progress and development according to her needs and aspirations within the framework program provided. This contrasts with many formal education systems where young people must fit themselves into a rigid structure with little recognition of individual needs and differences. The Girl Guide/Girl Scout method is the specific way that the leadership works with girls and young women to achieve the mission of WAGGGS. It is an integrated approach with certain key elements: The Girl Guiding/Girl Scouting method can be used equally effectively with girls of all ages, abilities and backgrounds. In his book ""Girl Guiding,"" Lord Baden-Powell (1918) wrote:
 Many Girl Guides and Girl Scouts end up becoming leading politicians, writers, businesswomen, and leaders. Senator Hillary Clinton (United States Senate), the Rt. Hon Dr. Marjorie Mowlam MP (politician in the United Kingdom), Roberta Bondar Ph.D., MD (first Canadian woman astronaut), and Betty Okwir (leading politician in Uganda) are just a few former and current Girl Guides and Girl Scouts.
 In 1965, Dame Leslie Whateley of the then-Girl Guides World Bureau was awarded the Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting.
 Amongst its global initiatives, Free Being Me, a collaboration between WAGGS and Unilever's Dove Self Esteem Project was launched in October 2013, with the aim of increasing ""self-esteem and body confidence"" in girls.[3]
 Girl Guides were formed in 1910 by Robert Baden-Powell, with the assistance of his sister Agnes Baden-Powell. After his marriage in 1912, his wife Olave Baden-Powell took a leading role in the development of Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting.
 As the movement spread, independent national Guiding associations were set up; however, a need for international cooperation was felt.  Lady Baden-Powell founded an informal International Council in London in February 1918.  At the fourth World Conference held at Camp Edith Macy in 1926, representatives from several countries suggested the formation of a World Association to take the place of the informal International Council. After the 1926 International Conference the Baden-Powells were approached about setting up a formal association and in 1928 the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts was founded at the 5th International Conference held in Parád, Hungary.[4] Rose Kerr was Vice Chairman, later Commissioner for Tenderfoot Countries. From 1930 to 1939 WAGGGS occupied a room at the headquarters of the British Girl Guide Association, until it moved to 9 Palace Street, next door to Our Ark.
 In 1920, two leaders from each known Guide country were invited to the British County Commissioners Conference held at Saint Hugh's College, Oxford. This became known as the First International Conference. The 13th World Conference was held in the same college in 1950. The member organizations continue to meet every three years (initially every two years) at World Conferences.[5]
 The World Conference is the governing body and meets every three years. If a country has more than one association, the associations form a federation for coordination and world representation.
 WAGGGS consists of national Member Organizations which are run independently but agree to abide by the WAGGGS constitution.  The national Member Organizations are split into five regions.  The member organizations in turn elect the World Board, originally the World Committee, which governs the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts.  It is made up of  17 active volunteer members from around the world who are democratically elected by all Member Organizations and include the Chairs from each of the five WAGGGS regions.  In addition there is the permanent staff of the World Bureau based in London and headed by the WAGGGS Chief Executive (formerly Director of the World Bureau).  Every three years representatives from the member states meet in a World Conference to discuss and vote on policy. The World Committee changed its name to the World Board in 1996. The job title of the head of staff was changed from Director of the World Bureau to Chief Executive between 1964 and 1997.
 Each WAGGGS Member Organization chooses how it believes it can best promote these goals, taking into account its culture and the needs of its young people. Some choose to work with girls alone in a single sex environment in order to break down stereotypes and to give girls and young women the confidence to take their place in society. Other Member Organizations prefer to work with mixed groups to enable young women and young men equal partnership within their units. Some Organizations choose to mix co-educational and single sex approaches according to the age and the preferences of the young people.
 The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts has five regions: Europe, Arab, Africa, Asia and Western Hemisphere.
 WAGGGS operates four World Centres that offer training programmes, activities and lodging for girls and leaders, as well as members of some other groups and independent travellers. Activities are primarily focused on international friendship and cooperation, personal development and leadership training, enjoyment and service. The Friends of the Four World Centres organisation supports and promotes the centres.
 The four World Centres are:
 A  new centre, Kusafiri, meaning “to journey” in Swahili,  was announced in 2015.  Unlike the other centres it will be a roving centre and exist for a fixed period of time in different places with a particular theme in Africa.[7]  While testing the idea, starting in 2012, the country organizations involved include Ghana, South Africa, Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria, and Benin.  Focuses so far have included “Stopping the Violence” training in Rwanda and developing entrepreneurial leaders among others.[7]
 Miss Kari Aas designed the World Trefoil emblem that was adopted at the World Conference in 1930, a gold trefoil on a blue background.[8]
 The three leaves represent the three duties and the three parts of the promise, the two five point-stars stand for the promise and the law and the vein in the centre represents the compass needle showing the right way. The base of the trefoil stands for the flame of the love of humanity and the colours blue and gold represent the sun shining over all children in the world.[9]
 The World Badge, incorporating the trefoil, was first adopted at the 11th World Conference in Evian, France in 1946.[10]
 The World Association Badge, similar in design to the World Badge, was first adopted at the 7th World Conference in Bucze, near Górki Wielkie in Poland, in 1932. It is worn by members of the World Board, its Committees, World Bureau and World Centre staff.[10]"
World Literacy Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Literacy_Foundation	"The World Literacy Foundation (WLF) is a global not-for-profit that works to lift young people out of poverty through literacy. Founded in Melbourne, Australia in 2003, the World Literacy Foundation operates on the principle that education is a basic human right. It aims to eradicate global illiteracy through the promotion of literacy and the provision of educational resources.
 The World Literacy foundation works to get communities involved and raise awareness of the importance of literacy. It is reported that 1 out of every 10, or 750 million people globally are illiterate.[1]
 Since its establishment in 2003, the World Literacy Foundation has grown to align with the needs of an evolving education sector. The World Literacy Foundation has worked towards forging partnerships with other leading educational and related not-for-profit organisations, and has built long-lasting relationships within communities around the world.
 The World Literacy Foundation significantly dedicates its time and resources to conducting research, and uses resulting information to help advocate in local communities as well as on a global scale. It mobilise communities through passionate volunteers, and seeks to give individuals a voice so that they can also act as advocates for literacy within their own communities. The World Literacy Foundation believes that raising community awareness is vital to the improvement of literacy standards.
 The World Literacy Foundation annually monitors a range of indicators in the education area and prepares a report on economic and social cost of illiteracy. In 2012, the WLF compiled a report which focuses on the economic and social cost of illiteracy in the United Kingdom. The research was devoted to economic and social cost of illiteracy in the country.[2] It stated that one in five of the UK population is functionally illiterate and this rate costs the national economy 81 billion pounds a year in lost earnings and high welfare spending.
 The World Literacy Foundation convened the World Literacy Summit at Oxford University (UK) in April 2012 to stimulate co-operation in the global literacy sector in order to support 796 million illiterate people in developed and developing worlds. The list of invited delegates included about 300 leaders in the fields of government, development, literacy and academic sectors.[3] The Oxford Declaration became the resulting document of this event; it was designed to combine efforts of government, business, non-governmental organizations and educational institutions to promote literacy worldwide.[4]
 The World Literacy Foundation's projects are aimed at raising global literacy rates and teaching educational standards. The World Literacy Foundation volunteers and partner communities have worked in Azerbaijan, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Colombia, Mozambique, Uganda, and other developing countries to provide access to quality education and learning resources to disadvantaged communities. With bases on five of the seven continents, the World Literacy Foundation tailors each operation to the country's specific literacy needs. In the African sect based in Uganda, where many people live in poverty and have no electricity the World Literacy Foundation has donated solar powered tablets. Paired with the Sun Books initiative the World Literacy Foundation is not just donating recourses but also training to teachers at the primary school level. [5]
 Where the foundation was started in Australia, the goal is geared towards closing the gap of literacy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. For indigenous people illiteracy rates are a more prominent problem. To improve skills such as reading and number skills, the World Literacy Foundation has developed a program called the Indigenous Learning App. This app contains multilingual e-books and multiple literacy games in not just English but also the local dialect in Australia.[1][2][6]
 In the African sect with headquarters in Uganda, where many people live in poverty and have no electricity the World Literacy Foundation has donated solar powered tablets. Paired with the Sun Books initiative the World Literacy Foundation is not just donating recourses but also training to teachers at the primary school level on how to use these resources effectively. The solar powered tablets come preloaded with digital learning content and multilingual e-books. In Uganda only roughly 27% of people have access to electricity and the cost of one book can be a whole month's salary. These Sun Books are useful in the sense that they do not need to be electrically charged and are universal tools, coming loaded with multiple uses.[7]
 Several years ago, the World Literacy Foundation founded their South America sect in Manizales, Colombia. Latin America is in dire need of educational reform, over 35 million people over the age of 15 are illiterate. Here it is only expected that children attend school for 6 years compared to the traditional 12 most other countries require. To help improve these statistics the World Literacy Foundation runs two classes a week for over 60 children and other community members. During beneficial classes the World Literacy Foundation supports learners of all ages with tutoring and reading services.[7]
 In the United Kingdom illiteracy costs the UK’s economy roughly $50 billion USD a year. It is here the World Literacy Foundation has run 26 fundraising projects, book distribution drives and provides numerous services. To help combat illiteracy the World literacy Foundation provides services such as parent mentoring, tutoring services, delivering literacy recourses, and distributes multilingual children/baby books. In the UK the World Literacy Foundation also has made a pack to new mothers to whom English would not be their first language to improve literacy and help them improve their standard of life.[7]
 Even in the United States of America there is a literacy crisis. This gap can be measured by 30 million words, and this stretches from learners who live in poverty to those who are afforded the best education money can buy. Although it is not just the socioeconomics that divide America’s literate, literacy rates also greatly range between racial groups. To support American learners the World Literacy Foundation has encouraged 150 schools to participate in International literacy Day. In February 2019 a project called Michigan Reads debut, it is an initiative to provide tutoring and literacy resources to children from all backgrounds in Michigan. In America there are also over 60 Youth Ambassadors who promote literacy in their schools and communities..[3][7]
 The World Literacy Foundation hosts several global projects a year. The most popular being the International Day of Literacy. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared International Literacy Day September 8th and is annually celebrated by 4,000 schools. Each school participates by hosting events and fundraising to spread literacy awareness, and the belief that literacy is a basic human right. By encouraging schools to participate the World Literacy Foundation aims to spread awareness and understanding about the importance of literacy. By providing literacy skills through the promotion of International Literacy Day, the World Literacy Foundation hopes to also inspire learners to shoot for the stars and be the best them they can be.[8]
 The Youth Ambassador project is run globally starting from the beginning of the application process in February the project runs through November when applicants are certified. The World Literacy Foundation enlists people ages 12-24 years old to raise awareness for literacy in their communities. Recently as 2018 the foundation has enlisted ambassadors from 35 separate countries ranking more then 300 strong. Youth Ambassadors work collectively as a group of motivated individuals who aim to eradicate illiteracy.[8]
 Every two years the World Literacy Foundation hosts an event called the World Literacy Summit. Held in Oxford, UK this is a three-day long event in which numerous minds gather to discuss all matters surrounding global illiteracy. This event brings together literacy and educational leaders, specialists from governments, and inter-government bodies, for profit sectors, academic scholars and researchers. The goal is to build a global community of continuous collaboration on ideas and awareness for literacy. The fourth World Literacy Summit will happen on the 5th of April 2020. [9]
 In 1965, UNESCO declared September 8th Internationa Literacy Day, then on the same day in 2016 the World Literacy Foundation launched the “The Sky’s The Limit” campaign. The purpose of this campaign is to hopefully eliminate the digital divide that separate communities in which electricity is not available.[10]
 Another important project in Australia is “Reading Out of Poverty” (ROOP), where the World Literacy Foundation distribute children’s books, literacy resources and tutoring to enhance literacy skills and reading levels of children from low income backgrounds. 
 Although the World Literacy Foundation brings together many initiatives, projects and resources it is the communities who make the whole idea work. Between the corporation and openness of the participating communities and people like the Youth Ambassadors who donate their time, they are the ones who help this foundation function. Without volunteers and open minds nothing would change. But this change is essential, it will eventually allow for a greater level of understanding between all people. 
 According to studies by the World Literacy Foundation ""illiterate parents tend to have lower expectations and aspirations regarding education for themselves and their children”. Poor families often place work before education and the children of the parents who have failed to complete primary education tend to do the same. The cost of illiteracy to the global economy is est. at USD $1.19 trillion.[11] Illiteracy does not only impact us as a society economically. It also impacts the group of people who cannot advocate for themselves because they do not possess literacy skills to do so. In countries like Latin America where work is valued over school many children only receive half the education they are entitled to. Other reports published by the World Literacy Foundation also found those who cannot read earn lower salaries and illiterate parents' children are more likely to grow up unable to read and be trapped in a cycle.[12]
 The mission of the World Literacy foundation is to ensure every individual has the opportunity to acquire literacy and reading skills. Regardless of geographic location, financial situation or social status, the World Literacy Foundation believes access to education is a basic human right.

World Medical Relief	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Medical_Relief	"World Medical Relief is a multi-funded, non-profit charitable organization based in Detroit, United States. It is presently located in a northern suburb of Detroit, Southfield, MI.
 World Medical Relief was established in 1953 by Detroit housewife Irene M. Auberlin, who mobilized her friends and family to collect food, baby clothing, cribs, and medicines to ship overseas for a Korean war orphan. The initial help for one small boy turned into a larger mission: relieving the pain and suffering of an entire orphanage filled with 400 children.
 World Medical Relief began collecting and distributing recycled medical and dental equipment, medical supplies, and medicines to aid thousands of sick and poor people around the world. By the words of Mrs. Auberlin, they were doing ""God's work"" by turning the sins of waste into the miracles of mercy. 
Although Mrs. Auberlin died in 1999, WMR continues to follow the path of a ""world class beggar"" and helps the poorest countries and citizens of the globe.
 In 1966, the organization was granted a State of Michigan pharmacy license to fulfill prescription medication assistance program for low-income senior citizens of the state. 
In 2010, the agency became the responsible agency to manage the blanket program for the homeless in the Metro Detroit area. The American Red Cross Southeastern Chapter, that had handled the program for many years, changed its focus and gave up the blanket program. Rather than see it discontinue, World Medical Relief agreed to take it over and renamed the program the Blanket Relief for Area Shelters.
 George V. Samson is the current president and CEO of World Medical Relief.
 World Medical Relief declares its mission to impact the well-being of the medically impoverished on a local, national, and international basis. 
It collects financial donations and goods, including medical, dental, and laboratory items,  purchases and distributes such commodities. Goods are reported to be distributed in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, gender, religion, nationality or political beliefs.
 The goals of the organization are stated as follows:
 In 2005, World Medical Relief spent $18,405,574 on its charity programs, according to its annual report.[1]"
World Scout Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Scout_Foundation	"The World Scout Foundation (WSF) is an international non-profit institution based in Geneva, Switzerland funded in 1969, but reorganized in the current form in 1977. The stated mission of the organization is to develop World Scouting by the provision of financial and other support to help develop the World Scout Movement through the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). The Honorary President is HM Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden who actively participates in the activities of the foundation. The organisation is headed by Chairman Siegfried Wieser, and Director John Geoghegan. [1][2]
 The WSF is permanently investing capital donations from individuals, foundations, corporations, governments, and from members of the Scout Movement. Nearly all of the earned profit from investments is  donated to the WOSM. The Foundation also seeks non-capital donations to support specific World Scouting projects, such as the Gifts of Peace project.[3]
 Total donations in excess of US$ 10,000 entitle donors to membership of the Baden-Powell World Fellowship. The fellowship now has more than 2,200 members in 70 countries and territories.
 The Honours Programme recognizes those who have attained higher levels of financial support to the World Scout Foundation.
 Recognition for attainment of these Circles of Membership is given on a special occasion, usually by the Honorary Chairman of the World Scout Foundation.
All gifts to the Foundation are counted toward achieving the four Circles of the Honors Programme. These include contributions made to the World Baden-Powell Fellowship, the Royal Birthday Appeal, and the Queen Silvia Fund.
 The Queen Silvia Fund is an endowment which enables young handicapped people, worldwide, to benefit through Scouting. It was created as a lasting gift to commemorate the 50th birthday celebration of Queen Silvia of Sweden. The fund's slogan is ""There can be no task nobler than giving every child a better future.""
 The initial gifts of over US$100,000 came from members of the World Scout Foundation's Baden-Powell Fellowship. Since then the endowment has grown to a quarter of million dollars, and the fund continuously solicits for more donations. The queen personally approves each project grant."
World Transformation Movement	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Transformation_Movement	"Jeremy Griffith (born 1945) is an Australian biologist and author.[1][2] He first came to public attention for his attempts to find the Tasmanian tiger. He later became noted for his writings on the human condition and theories about human progress.[3][4] He founded the World Transformation Movement to advance his ideas in 1983.
 Griffith was educated at Tudor House School in New South Wales and the Geelong Grammar School in Victoria. [5]
 He first became known for his search for surviving Tasmanian tigers or thylacines,[6] the last known specimen of which died in captivity in 1936. The search conducted from 1967 to 1973,[7] [8] included exhaustive surveys along Tasmania's west coast;[7] installation of automatic camera stations; prompt investigations of claimed sightings;[9] and, in 1972, the creation of the Thylacine Expeditionary Research Team with Dr Bob Brown, which concluded without finding any evidence of the animal's continuing existence.[8]
 Griffith began writing on the human condition in 1975, publishing the first of his six books on the subject in 1988.[10] A Species In Denial (2003) became a bestseller in Australia and New Zealand.[11] His writing is known for allowing readers to access the thoughts of many famous philosophers, thinkers and religious sources.[12]
 His biological works on the origins of human nature assert that ""humans act angrily because of a battle between instinct and intellect"".[13]The Irish Times summarised the thesis presented in Freedom as ""Adam & Eve without the guilt: explaining our battle between instinct and intellect"";[14] Kirkus Reviews wrote that ""Griffith offers a treatise about the true nature of humanity and about overcoming anxieties about the world"".[15]
 The Templeton Prize winner and biologist Charles Birch, the New Zealand zoologist  John Edward Morton, the former president of the Canadian Psychiatric Association  Harry Prosen, and the Australian Everest mountaineer Tim Macartney-Snape have been  long-standing proponents of Griffith’s ideas.  Morton publicly defended Griffith when he and his ideas were attacked in the mid-1990s.[13] Griffith’s ideas have been criticised based on perceived problems with the empirical veracity of his anthropological writings, an objection that highlights his reliance on the writings of the African novelist Sir Laurens Van Der Post, and also the work of anthropologist Elizabeth Marshall Thomas.[16]
 Griffith has argued throughout his writings that the driving force in human evolution was increased nurturing of offspring, a process he calls 'love indoctrination'.[17] He adopts a neo-Lamarckian view in which mothers model pro-social behaviour to offspring, with consequent behavioural changes resulting in 'soft' Lamarckian inheritance. Such behaviours will differentially proliferate if they are performed in the context of a social niche in which co-operative behaviour is favoured. Consequent to this genetic selection will stabilise changes that were initiated at the level of social behaviour. It is this process that he argues gave rise to the human moral sense. Evidence for this view is the reduced sexual dimorphism in the early stages of human evolution, particularly the loss of the aggressive canine morphology evident in other extant primate taxa. The theory postulates an intensification of maternal care, and associated increased pro-social behaviour of offspring, as being the distinguishing feature of the human lineage. His theory echoes that of Adrienne Zihlman, who postulated changes in patterns of sub-adult socialisation may have been important in the early stages of human evolution.[18]
 The World Transformation Movement was founded by Griffith in 1983, as the Centre for Humanity’s Adulthood, an organisation dedicated to developing and promoting understanding of the human condition. It was incorporated in 1990 with Griffith and his colleague mountaineer Tim Macartney-Snape among its founding directors and became a registered charity in New South Wales in 1990,  known as the Foundation for Humanity’s Adulthood. In 2009, the name changed to  World Transformation Movement.[19]
 In 1995, Griffith, Macartney-Snape and the Foundation for Humanity’s Adulthood ( the World Transformation Movement name at the time) were the subject of an Australian Broadcasting Corporation Four Corners program[20]  and a Sydney Morning Herald newspaper article, in which it was alleged that Macartney-Snape used speaking appearances at schools to promote the  Foundation, which was described as a cult. The publications became the subject of  defamation actions in the NSW Supreme Court .[21][22] In 2007, the ABC was ordered to pay Macartney-Snape almost $500,000 in damages, and with costs the payout was expected to exceed $1 million.[22] The proceedings against the Herald were resolved when it published an apology to the Foundation  in 2009.[23] Although Griffith was not awarded damages in relation to the Four Corners broadcast, on appeal in 2010 the NSW Court of Appeal found what was said of him was untrue.[24]"
World Vision International	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision_International	"World Vision International is an Evangelical[8][9] Christian humanitarian aid, development, and advocacy organization. It prefers to present itself as interdenominational and also employs staff from non-evangelical Christian denominations.[10] It was founded in 1950 by Robert Pierce as a service organization to meet the emergency needs of missionaries.[9] In 1975 development work was added to World Vision's objectives.[9] It is active in nearly 100 countries with a total revenue including grants, product and foreign donations of more than $2 billion (2017).
 The charity was founded in 1950 as World Vision Inc. by Robert Pierce and co-founder Frank Phillips with the first office in Portland, Oregon.[9] Originally, the charity operated as a missionary service organization meeting emergency needs in crisis areas in East Asia, where in 1954 it opened an office in South Korea.[11] In order to restructure the organization World Vision International was founded in 1977 by Walter Stanley Mooneyham the then president of World Vision.[12][13]
 In 1967, the Mission Advanced Research and Communication Center (MARC) was founded by Ed Dayton as a division of World Vision International. It became the organizational backbone of the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, collected and published data about ""unreached people"" and also published the ""Mission Handbook: North American Protestant Ministries Overseas"".[14]
 During the 1970s, World Vision began training families to build small farms by teaching agricultural skills aiming to make lasting effects in the communities they were helping by promoting self-reliance[15] The organization also began installing water pumps for clean water in communities which caused infant mortality rates to drop. Volunteers now use the fresh water to teach communities gardening and irrigation and promote good health.[15]
 During the 1990s, World Vision International began focusing on the needs of children who had been orphaned in Uganda, Romania, and Somalia in response to AIDS, neglect, and civil war, respectively. They began educating other African communities on AIDS after realizing its impact. They also joined the United Nations peacekeeping efforts to help those affected by civil war. World Vision also started to openly promote the international ban on land mines.[15] In 1994 World Vision US moved to Washington State.[16]
 According to Forbes magazine, as of December 2014, World Vision is the 11th largest charity in the United States with total revenue of over 981 million dollars.[17]
 World Vision Partnership now operates as a federation of interdependent national offices governed by the same agreement but with three different levels of central control.  
 The Covenant of Partnership is a document that all national members of the World Vision Partnership have to sign. According to this document all national offices have to accept policies and decisions established by the International Board and must not establish an office or program outside their own national borders without the consent of World Vision International and the host country. Except for direct project founding, all funds intended for outside their national borders have to be remitted through World Vision International. The financial planning and budget principles adopted by the International Board have to be accepted as well as an examination of the financial affairs of the national offices by Partnership representatives.[19]
 The president of World Vision International has a seat on all national offices with their own national board.
 The partnership offices – located in Geneva, Bangkok, Nairobi, Cyprus, Los Angeles, and San José, Costa Rica – coordinate operations of the organization and represent World Vision in the international arena. For making large scale decisions, the international organization considers opinions from each national office, whether in the developed or developing world.
 An international board of directors oversees the World Vision partnership. The full board meets twice a year to appoint senior officers, approve strategic plans and budgets, and determine international policy. The current chairperson of the international board is Donna Shepherd.[20] The international president is Kevin J. Jenkins.[21][22]
 World Vision's staff comes from a range of Christian denominations. Its staff includes followers of Protestantism, Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Around the world its staff includes followers of different religions or none.[23] Its staff participates in daily and weekly services. They stress that one can be a Christian in any culture. However, World Vision also respects other religions that it encounters, stating that ""to promote a secular approach to life would be an insult to them"".[24] Richard Stearns, president of World Vision US, stated that World Vision has a strict policy against proselytizing, which he describes as ""...using any kind of coercion or inducement to listen to a religious message before helping someone"".[25]
 The World Vision Partnership and all of its national members are committed to the concept of  transformational development,[26] which is cast in a biblical framework and in which evangelization is an integral part of development work.[27]
 Activities include: emergency relief, education, health care, economic development, and promotion of justice.  The organization  has consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council and partnerships with UN agencies like UNICEF, WHO, UNHCR and ILO, and  financial records reveal that it has funded evangelical activities all over the world.[28]
 Its approach to aid is to first help people and their communities recognize the resources that lie within them. With support from World Vision, it claims communities transform themselves by carrying out their own development projects in health care, agriculture production, water projects, education, micro-enterprise development, advocacy and other community programs.
 It also addresses factors that perpetuate poverty by what it describes as promoting justice. It supports community awareness of the collective ability to address unjust practices and begin working for change. It claims to speak out on issues such as child labor, debt relief for poor nations,[29] and the use of children as combatants in armed conflict. World Vision International has endorsed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It claims to foster opportunities to help reduce conflict levels and to contribute to the peaceful resolution of hostilities and reconciliation of disputes.[30]
 World Vision encourages public awareness about the needs of others, the causes of poverty, and the nature of compassionate response.[31] These efforts include collaboration with media and community participation in fundraising.[32] In areas of the world that are considered too dangerous for news organizations to send their crews, World Vision's own videographers supply newscasters with  footage of events from these areas.[33] In its communications, the organization claims to uphold the dignity of children and families in presenting explanations of the causes and consequences of poverty, neglect, abuse and war.[34]
 The organization was one of the founding members of global IT nonprofit NetHope.[35]
With more than 50 years of experience in India, World Vision India works in 24 states across the country through development that is community based, sustainable and transformational emergency response and disaster mitigation, advocacy initiatives that are grassroots based.
World Vision India is a national NGO in partnership with a network of over 100 other entities within World Vision International. World Vision India is registered as a society under the Tamil Nadu Societies Act with its National Office based in Chennai. Governed by an autonomous Board of Directors, World Vision's programmes are facilitated by close to 1700 staff.
 In 2015 World Vision took part in operations to bring earthquake relief to Nepal.[36]
 World Vision runs a child sponsorship program which aims to help needy children, families and communities access clean drinking water, sanitation, education, skills for future livelihood, nutrition, health care and participate in an age-appropriate in development processes. World Vision operates on the theory that by changing the lives of children, the child sponsorship program facilitates overall growth and development in the community, as it helps communities to build a better future through empowerment, education, income generation, and self-sufficiency.[37]
 World Vision uses the Sponsor a Child method of fundraising.[38]
 In a 2008 report on famine in Ethiopia, reporter Andrew Geoghegan, from Australian TV programme Foreign Correspondent, visited his 14-year-old sponsor child. The girl has ""been part of a World Vision program all her life"" yet says (in translated subtitle) ""Until recently, I didn't know I had a sponsor."" And when asked about her knowledge of World Vision sponsorship says, ""Last time they gave me this jacket and a pen."" Geoghegan was disconcerted to find that despite being ""told by World Vision that [the girl] was learning English at school, and was improving...she speaks no English at all"".[39]
 In response, World Vision stated that ""it unapologetically takes a community-based approach to development"", in which the money is not directly provided to the family of the sponsored child.[40] The organization argued that the ""direct benefit"" approach would result in jealousy among other community members without children and would not work.[40]
 Foreign Correspondent replied to World Vision concerning child sponsorship, showing contradictions between the organization's literature that creates the impression that donated money goes directly to the sponsor child and evidence of cases where supposedly sponsored children received little if any benefit.[41]
 ""In February 2007...World Vision received an anonymous tip that lower level World Vision Liberia employees in key positions...were diverting food deliveries and building supplies for personal gain. World Vision immediately launched an investigation into the allegations, sending auditors to [their] field sites. Through this extensive internal audit, World Vision uncovered the nature and extent of the alleged violations and furnished detailed documentation that assisted the U.S. Government's subsequent investigation.""[42]
 On October 25, 2013 World Vision Malawi cancelled a visit and fact-finding trip by a dozen United States Christians from San Antonio, Texas. A fear of danger and instability resulted from the dismissal of  World Vision Malawi staff due to corruption. At the same time, the Malawi government  fired the president's cabinet because of corruption.[citation needed]
 Ian Buchanan, author of ""Armies Of God: A Study In Militant Christianity"", has claimed that World Vision is effectively an arm of the United States Department of State.[43]
 On March 24, 2014, the United States branch of World Vision announced that it would no longer ban employees from being in same-sex marriages.[44] Facing protests from donors and the larger evangelical community after the announcement, World Vision reversed the policy change two days later.[45][46]
 The political weekly Tehelka has cited World Vision India's involvement with AD2000 as proof of evangelism.[47] Radhakant Nayak, a leader of World Vision's local chapter in Orissa, was also accused by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of being involved in the murder of Swami Lakshmanananda.[48][49] World Vision India condemned the murder and denied any involvement, pointing out its anti-proselytizing policy.[50] Valerie Tarico, a commentator on religious and social topics, points out that World Vision defines proselytism as ""Proselytism takes place whenever assistance is offered on condition that people must listen or respond to a message or as an inducement to leave one and join another part of the Christian church."" which does not in general exclude evangelism. Furthermore, she mentions the phrase ""serving as a witness to the gospel of Jesus Christ"" as part of World Vision's description of its mission and identifies the word ""witness"" as an evangelical code word for seeking converts.[51]
 In 1982, after World Vision publicly criticized Israel actions in Palestinian refugee camps near Sidon and Tyre, it came under attack from conservative evangelicals and the government of Israel. In spite of this pressure, WV president Mooneyham presented to the eight hundred thousand readers of World Vision Magazine a report ""showing 255 bodies and ankle-deep body fluids left in a school basement by an Israeli bomb.""[52] In this September issues of World Vision Magazine President Stanley Mooneyham was quoted describing Israeli actions with the behavior of Hitler's army, ""reminiscent of Warsaw.""[53] In the same month Mooneyham was forced to resign when, according to former World Vision employee Ken Waters, his leadership style was criticized; he was replaced as President by Ted Engstrom.[54]
 In February 2012, based on information provided by the Shurat HaDin - Israel Law Center, World Vision Australia allegedly provided ""financial aid to a Gaza-based terrorist group"", the Union of Agricultural Work Committees (UAWC), which they also alleged is a ""front for terror group the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine"". WV had ""suspended its dealings"" with UAWC until the outcome of the investigation.[55][56] WV resumed working with UAWC after AusAID and World Vision found the allegations were unfounded.[57] The Israel Law Center considers World Vision's response to be a whitewash and maintains that the allegations have not been refuted.[58]
 On June 15, 2016, Mohammad El Halabi, manager of World Vision in Gaza, was arrested at the Erez border crossing and charged by Israeli prosecutors with channeling its funds directly to Hamas, a listed terror organization.[59]  A senior official with Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, stated that Halabi was recruited by the military wing of Hamas in 2004 and instructed to penetrate World Vision.[59][60][61] According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Halabi transferred cash to Hamas to help it in digging military tunnels and purchasing weapons.[61] Muhammad Mahmoud, Halabi's lawyer, told Haaretz that his client has nothing to do with Hamas and that the fact that the investigation had lasted 55 days proves that there is a problem with evidence.[61] Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency claims that about $48 million of World Vision resources were funneled to Hamas in just six years and another $80,000 was used for building a Hamas position in Beit Hanon and for paying salaries of Hamas members who fought against Israel in the 2014 war. World Vision confirmed that its funds are spent in accordance with legal requirements that contribute to peace and that the charity works closely with the UN and Red Cross.[62] The charity initially defended Halabi as a ""humanitarian"".[63]
 In August 2016, Israeli officials claimed that the World Vision organization was providing the military wing of Hamas with tens of millions of dollars in Gaza. World Vision has denounced these allegations which come amid Israeli campaigns against the non-governmental organizations that worked with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.[citation needed]
 The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade immediately suspended all funding of Palestinian programs by World Vision.[64] World Vision Australia chief executive, Tim Costello, accepted this move as being the correct thing to do pending a proper investigation of the allegations.[65][66] A review of the Australian government
came to the conclusion that no Australian taxpayer money was diverted to Hamas.[67]"

 a First office opened 11 September 1961 in Morges,   Switzerland.
b Also the WWF's first president.[4]
 The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international non-governmental organization founded in 1961, working in the field of the wilderness preservation, and the reduction of human impact on the environment.[5] It was formerly named the World Wildlife Fund, which remains its official name in Canada and the United States.[5]
 WWF is the world's largest conservation organization with over five million supporters worldwide, working in more than 100 countries, supporting around 1,300 conservation and environmental projects.[6]  They have invested over $1 billion in more than 12,000 conservation initiatives since 1995.[7] WWF is a foundation with 55% of funding from individuals and bequests, 19% from government sources (such as the World Bank, DFID, USAID) and 8% from corporations in 2014.[8][9]
 WWF aims to ""stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.""[10] The Living Planet Report is published every two years by WWF since 1998; it is based on a Living Planet Index and ecological footprint calculation.[5] In addition, WWF has launched several notable worldwide campaigns including Earth Hour and Debt-for-Nature Swap, and its current work is organized around these six areas: food, climate, freshwater, wildlife, forests, and oceans.[5][7]
 WWF has received criticism for its alleged corporate ties.[11][12] It has also been accused of supporting paramilitary groups tasked with stopping poaching who are responsible for numerous human rights abuses.[13]
 The Conservation Foundation, a precursor to WWF, was founded in 1948 by Fairfield Osborn as an affiliate of the New York Zoological Society (today known as the Wildlife Conservation Society) with an aim of protecting the world's natural resources. The advisory council included leading scientists such as Charles Sutherland Elton, G. Evelyn Hutchinson, Aldo Leopold, Carl Sauer, and Paul Sears.[14] It supported much of the scientific work cited by Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, including that of John L. George, Roger Hale, Robert Rudd, and George Woodwell.
 The idea for a fund on behalf of endangered animals was officially proposed by Victor Stolan to Sir Julian Huxley in response to articles he published in the British newspaper The Observer. This proposal led Huxley to put Stolan in contact with Max Nicholson, a person who had had thirty years experience of linking progressive intellectuals with big business interests through the Political and Economic Planning think tank.[1][15][16] Nicholson thought up the name of the organization. WWF was conceived on 29 April 1961, under the name of World Wildlife Fund, and its first office was opened on 11 September that same year in Morges, Switzerland.
 The WWF was conceived to act as a funding institution for existing conservation groups such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and The Conservation Foundation.[17] Godfrey A. Rockefeller also played an important role in its creation, assembling the first staff.[2] Its establishment was marked with the signing of the ""Morges Manifesto"", the founding document that sets out the fund's commitment to assisting worthy organizations struggling to save the world's wildlife:[18]
 They need above all money, to carry out mercy missions and to meet conservation emergencies by buying land where wildlife treasures are threatened, and in many other ways. Money, for example, to pay guardians of wildlife refuges .... Money for education and propaganda among those who would care and help if only they understood. Money to send out experts to danger spots and to train more local wardens and helpers in Africa and elsewhere. Money to maintain a sort of 'war room' at the international headquarters of conservation, showing where the danger spots are and making it possible to ensure that their needs are met before it is too late. Dutch Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld helped found the World Wildlife Fund, becoming its first President in 1961. In 1963, the Foundation held a conference and published a major report warning of anthropogenic global warming, written by Noel Eichhorn based on the work of Frank Fraser Darling (then foundation vice president), Edward Deevey, Erik Eriksson, Charles Keeling, Gilbert Plass, Lionel Walford, and William Garnett.[19]
 In 1970, along with Duke of Edinburgh and a few associates, Prince Bernhard established the WWF's financial endowment The 1001: A Nature Trust to handle the WWF's administration and fund-raising. 1001 members each contributed $10,000 to the trust.[20] Prince Bernhard resigned his post after being involved in the Lockheed Bribery Scandal.[21]
 
The WWF has set up offices and operations around the world. It originally worked by fundraising and providing grants to existing non-governmental organizations with an initial focus on the protection of endangered species. As more resources became available, its operations expanded into other areas such as the preservation of biological diversity, sustainable use of natural resources, the reduction of pollution, and climate change. The organization also began to run its own conservation projects and campaigns.[citation needed] In 1986, the organization changed its name to World Wildlife Fund for Nature, while retaining the WWF initials. However, it continued at that time to operate under the original name in the United States and Canada.[22]
 1986 was the 25th anniversary of WWF's foundation, an event marked by a gathering in Assisi, Italy to which the organization's International President HRH Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, invited religious authorities representing Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism. These leaders produced The Assisi Declarations, theological statements showing the spiritual relationship between their followers and nature that triggered a growth in the engagement of those religions with conservation around the world.[22]
 In the 1990s, WWF revised its mission statement to:
 Stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature, by:
 [citation needed]
 WWF scientists and many others identified 238 ecoregions that represent the world's most biologically outstanding terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats, based on a worldwide biodiversity analysis which the organization says was the first of its kind.[23] In the early 2000s (decade), its work was focused on a subset of these ecoregions, in the areas of forest, freshwater and marine habitat conservation, endangered species conservation, climate change, and the elimination of the most toxic chemicals.
 We shan't save all we should like to, but we shall save a great deal more than if we had never tried. In 1990, the Conservation Foundation was completely merged into WWF, after becoming an affiliate of WWF-US in 1985 when it became a distinct legal entity but with the same staff and board.[5] The organization now known as the Conservation Foundation in the United States is the former Forest Foundation of DuPage County.[17][24] In 1996, the organization obtained general consultative status from UNESCO.[citation needed]
 WWF's giant panda logo originated from a panda named Chi Chi that had been transferred from Beijing Zoo to London Zoo in 1958, three years before WWF became established.  Being famous as the only panda residing in the Western world at that time, its uniquely recognisable physical features and status as an endangered species were seen as ideal to serve the organization's need for a strong recognisable symbol that would overcome all language barriers.[25] The organization also needed an animal that would have an impact in black and white printing. The logo was then designed by Sir Peter Scott from preliminary sketches by Gerald Watterson, a Scottish naturalist.[26][27]
 The logo was slightly simplified and made more geometric in 1978, and was revised significantly again in 1986, at the time that the organization changed its name, with the new version featuring solid black shapes for eyes.[28] In 2000 a change was made to the font used for the initials ""WWF"" in the logo.[29]
 Policies of the WWF are made by board members elected for three-year terms. An Executive Team guides and develops WWF's strategy. There is also a National Council which stands as an advisory group to the board and a team of scientists and experts in conservation who research for WWF.
 National and international law plays an important role in determining how habitats and resources are managed and used. Laws and regulations become one of the organization's global priorities.
 The WWF has been opposed to the extraction of oil from the Canadian tar sands and has campaigned on this matter. Between 2008 and 2010 the WWF worked with The Co-operative Group, the UK's largest consumer co-operative to publish reports which concluded that: (1) exploiting the Canadian tar sands to their full potential would be sufficient to bring about what they described as 'runaway climate change;[30] (2) carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology cannot be used to reduce the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to a level comparable to that of other methods of oil extraction;[31] (3) the $379 billion which is expected to be spent extracting oil from tar sands could be better spent on research and development in renewable energy technology;[32] and (4) the expansion of tar sands extraction poses a serious threat to the caribou in Alberta .[33]
 The organization convinces and helps governments and other political bodies to adopt, enforce, strengthen and/or change policies, guidelines and laws that affect biodiversity and natural resource use. It also ensures government consent and/or keeps their commitment to international instruments relating to the protection of biodiversity and natural resources.[34][35]
 In 2012, David Nussbaum, Chief Executive of WWF-UK, spoke out against the way shale gas is used in the UK, saying: ""... the Government must reaffirm its commitment to tackling climate change and prioritise renewables and energy efficiency.""[36]
 WWF's strategy for achieving its mission specifically concentrates on restoring populations of 36 species (species or species groups that are important for their ecosystem or to people, including elephants, tunas, whales, dolphins and porpoises), and ecological footprint in 6 areas (carbon emissions, cropland, grazing land, fishing, forestry and water).[citation needed]
 The organization also works on a number of global issues driving biodiversity loss and unsustainable use of natural resources, including finance, business practices, laws, and consumption choices. Local offices also work on national or regional issues.[37]
 WWF works with a large number of different groups to achieve its goals, including other NGOs, governments, business, investment banks, scientists, fishermen, farmers and local communities. It also undertakes public campaigns to influence decision makers, and seeks to educate people on how to live in a more environmentally friendly manner. It urges people to donate funds to protect the environment. The donors can also choose to receive gifts in return.[citation needed]
 
 Since 2008, through its Global Programme Framework (GPF), WWF has said it is concentrating its efforts on 13 global initiatives:[39]
 WWF publishes the Living Planet Index in collaboration with the Zoological Society of London. Along with ecological footprint calculations, the Index is used to produce a bi-yearly Living Planet Report giving an overview of the impact of human activity on the world.[41] In 2019, WWF and Knorr jointly published the Future 50 Foods report identifying ""50 Foods for Healthier People and a Healthier Planet"".[42]
 The organization also regularly publishes reports, fact sheets and other documents on issues related to its work, to raise awareness and provide information to policy and decision makers.[43]
 The German public television ARD aired a documentary on 22 June 2011 that claimed to show how the WWF cooperates with corporations such as Monsanto, providing sustainability certification in exchange for donations – essentially greenwashing.[50] WWF has denied the allegations.[51] By encouraging high-impact eco-tourism, the program alleges that WWF contributes to the destruction of habitat and species it claims to protect while also harming indigenous peoples.[52]
 The filmmaker, Wilfried Huismann, was sued by the WWF over his book, which was based on this documentary. In an out of court settlement, he agreed to remove or revise certain claims, although his spokeswoman claims that ""The new edition will certainly provide no differentiated analysis of the work of the WWF."" [53]
 WWF has been accused by the campaigner Corporate Watch of being too close to business to campaign objectively.[11][12] WWF claims partnering with corporations such as Coca-Cola, Lafarge, Carlos Slim's and IKEA will reduce their effect on the environment.[54]  WWF received €56 million (US$80 million) from corporations in 2010 (an 8% increase in support from corporations compared to 2009), accounting for 11% of total revenue for the year.[9]
 In 2012, German investigative journalist Wilfried Huissmann published a book called The Silence of the Pandas. It became a bestseller in Germany, but was banned from Britain until 2014, when it was released under the title of Pandaleaks, after a series of injunctions and court orders.[55] The book criticizes WWF for its supposed involvement with corporations that are responsible for large-scale destruction of the environment, such as Coca-Cola, and gives details into the existence of the secret 1001 Club, whose members, Huismann claims, continue to have an unhealthy influence on WWF's policy making.[55] WWF has sought to deny the allegations made against it.[56]
 In 2017, a report by Survival International claimed that WWF-funded paramilitaries are not only committing abuses against the indigenous Baka and Bayaka in the Congo Basin, who ""face harassment and beatings, torture and death"", but are also corrupt and aid in the destruction of conserved areas. The report accused the WWF and its guards of partnering with several logging companies who carried out deforestation, while the rangers ignored wildlife trafficking networks.[13]
 In 2019, an investigation by BuzzFeed News alleged that paramilitary groups funded by the organisation are engaged in serious human rights abuses against villagers, and the organisation has covered up the incidents and acted to protect the perpetrators from law enforcement. These armed groups were claimed to torture, sexually assault, and execute villagers based on false accusations. In one instance found by BuzzFeed News investigators, an 11-year-old boy was allegedly tortured by WWF-funded rangers in front of his parents;[57] the WWF ignored all complaints against the rangers. In another incident, a ranger attempted to rape a Tharu woman and, when she resisted, attacked her with bamboo stick until she lost consciousness. While the ranger was arrested, the woman was pressured not to press charges, resulting in the ranger going free. In 2010, WWF-sponsored rangers reportedly killed a 12-year-old girl who was collecting tree bark in Bardiya National Park. Park and WWF officials allegedly obstructed investigations in these cases, by ""falsifying and destroying evidence, falsely claiming the victims were poachers, and pressuring the families of the victims to withdraw criminal complaints"".[57][58] In July 2019 Buzzfeed reported that a leaked report by the WWF accused guards of beating and raping women including pregnant women while torturing men by tying their penises with fishing lines. The investigations were cut short after paramilitary groups threatened investigators with death. The investigators accused WWF of covering up the crimes. Releasing an official statement, the WWF claimed that the report was not made public to ensure the safety of the victims and that the guards were suspended and are awaiting prosecution. However Buzzfeed accused the WWF of attempting to withhold the report to the US congressional committee investigating the human rights violations by providing high redacted versions instead. [59][60]
 In the Central African Republic, WWF officials were reportedly involved in an arms deal, where the organization paid for 15 AK assault rifles and ammunition; but part of the money went unaccounted and apparently defrauded by the CAR army representatives selling the weapons.[57]
 The Kathmandu Post, which cooperated with BuzzFeed News on the investigations in Nepal, claimed there was intense lobbying and political pressure to release WWF-funded rangers arrested for murder. They interviewed activists who claimed they were promised donations for pressuring victims of abuse to drop charges against the rangers. When the local Tharu community protested, WWF officials carried out a counter-protest in favour of the accused and used park elephants to block Prithvi Highway.[61]
 An investigation by Rainforest Foundation UK found evidence of widespread physical and sexual assault by ‘eco-guards’  employed by the Salonga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo funded by the WWF.  These include two cases of gang rape, two extra-judicial killings, and multiple accounts of torture and other forms of mistreatment committed by park guards.[62]
 In reply to the investigations, the WWF stated that it takes any allegations seriously and would be launching an independent review into the cases raised. The organisation stated it has stringent policies designed to ensure it and its partners are safeguarding the rights and well-being of indigenous peoples and local communities, and should the review uncover any breaches, it is committed to taking swift action.[63]
 The President of Honor of WWF in Spain used to be King Juan Carlos I,[64] who has been a known hunting enthusiast. In 1962, when he was 24, he was invited by the German Baron Werner von Alvensleben to a hunt in Mozambique.[65] Since then, the Spanish King has taken part in hunting forays in Africa and Eastern Europe. In October 2004, he was a member of a hunt in Romania that killed a wolf and nine brown bears, including one that was pregnant, according to the Romanian newspaper Romania Libera.[66] He was also accused by a Russian official of killing a bear called Mitrofan, supposedly after giving vodka to the animal, in an episode that sparked controversy in Spain, although the claim was never proven.[67] In the same year, according to The Guardian, the Polish government allowed him to kill a European bison in Białowieża Forest, even though it was an endangered species.[68]
 Further controversy arose in April 2012 when the Spanish King's participation in an elephant hunt in Botswana was discovered only after he returned to Spain on an emergency flight after tripping over a step and fracturing his hip.[69] Many Spanish environmental groups and leftist parties criticized the monarch's hobby,[70] and the WWF stripped him of the honorary position in July 2012, in an extraordinary assembly by 94% of the votes of the members.[71]
 Prince Charles, the UK head of the WWF,[72] has stated that he enjoys fox hunting.[73]
 In 2000, the World Wide Fund for Nature sued the World Wrestling Federation (now named WWE) for unfair trade practices. Both parties had shared the initials ""WWF"" since 1979. The conservation organization claimed that the professional wrestling company had violated a 1994 agreement regarding international use of the WWF initials.[74][75]
 On 10 August 2001, a UK court ruled in favour of the World Wide Fund for Nature. The World Wrestling Federation filed an appeal in October 2001. However, on 10 May 2002, the World Wrestling Federation changed its Web address from WWF.com to WWE.com, and replaced every ""WWF"" reference on the existing site with ""WWE"", as a prelude to changing the company's name to ""World Wrestling Entertainment."" Its stock ticker also switched from WWF to WWE.
 The wrestling organization's abandonment of the ""WWF"" initialism did not end the two organizations' legal conflict. Later in 2002, the World Wide Fund for Nature petitioned the court for $360 million in damages, but was not successful. A subsequent request to overturn by the World Wide Fund for Nature was dismissed by the British Court of Appeal on 28 June 2007. In 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment won a limited decision which permitted them to continue marketing certain pre-existing products with the abandoned WWF logo. However, WWE was mandated to issue newly branded merchandise such as apparel, action figures, video games, and DVDs with the ""WWE"" initials. Additionally, the court order required the company to remove both auditory and visual references to ""WWF"" in its library of video footage outside the United Kingdom.
 Starting with the 1,000th episode of Raw in July 2012, the WWF ""scratch"" logo is no longer censored in archival footage. In addition, the WWF initials are no longer censored when spoken or when written in plain text in archival footage.  In exchange, WWE is no longer permitted to use the WWF initials or logo in any new, original footage, packaging, or advertising, with any old-school logos for retro-themed programming now using a modification of the original WWF logo without the F.
 In June 2009, Touch Seang Tana, chairman of Cambodia's Commission for Conservation and Development of the Mekong River Dolphins Eco-tourism Zone, argued that the WWF had misrepresented the danger of extinction of the Mekong dolphin to boost fundraising.[76] The report stated that the deaths were caused by a bacterial disease that became fatal due to environmental contaminants suppressing the dolphins' immune systems.[77] He called the report unscientific and harmful to the Cambodian government and threatened the WWF's Cambodian branch with suspension unless they met with him to discuss his claims.[78] Touch Seang Tana later said he would not press charges of supplying false information and would not make any attempt to prevent WWF from continuing its work in Cambodia, but advised WWF to adequately explain its findings and check with the commission before publishing another report. After this, in January 2012, Touch Seang Tana signed the ""Kratie Declaration on the Conservation of the Mekong River Irrawaddy Dolphin"" along with WWF and the Cambodian Fisheries Administration, an agreement binding the parties to work together on a ""roadmap"" addressing dolphin conservation in the Mekong River.[79]"
Wounded Warrior Project	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Warrior_Project	"Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) is a charity and veterans service organization that offers a variety of programs, services and events for wounded veterans of the military actions following September 11, 2001. It operates as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization.[2]
 As of June 1, 2015, WWP served 71,866 registered alumni and 11,494 registered members.[3] The organization has partnered with several other charities, including the American Red Cross, Resounding Joy, a music therapy group in California, and Operation Homefront.[4][5] WWP has also provided a year-long Track program, which helps veterans transition to college and the workplace.[5]
 Wounded Warrior Project was founded in 2003[1] in Roanoke, Virginia,[6] by John Melia.[7][8] Melia had been severely wounded in a helicopter crash while serving in Somalia in 1992.[6] Melia assembled backpacks distributed to injured veterans at the former Bethesda Naval Hospital (Walter Reed National Military Medical Center) and Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
 Wounded Warrior Project initially operated as a division of the United Spinal Association of New York,[7][9] which adopted WWP as a program in November 2003. The WWP continued to support injured service members by providing them with free WWP Backpacks filled with comfort items
 In September 2005, The United Spinal Association granted $2.7 million to WWP to ""develop into a stand-alone charity with its own identity and programs,"" with the intent to expand its services from providing immediate comfort items to providing longer-term support for returning wounded veterans via compensation, education, health care, insurance, housing, employment, etc.[10]
 The WWP Backpacks program remains a central activity of WWP, evidenced by the more than 65,000 backpacks the organization had distributed as of early 2018,[11] in support of transitioning U.S. military veterans.
 CEO Steven Nardizzi and COO Al Giordano were fired from Wounded Warrior Project after it was revealed in 2016 that they spent massive amounts of the nonprofit's money on lavish company retreats and personal enrichment for themselves.[12][13][14] Several former employees alleged that they were fired because they raised concerns over the mismanagement.[15]
 An independent report, completed in September 2016, provided evidence that the allegations were not true.[16] After several accusations of inappropriate spending, Wounded Warrior Project undertook a forensic accounting of six years of expenses totaling almost $1.245 billion and found that no money was misappropriated or misspent.[17] During the following next few years, the ensuing loss of donations likely cost the organization tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.[18]
 Wounded Warrior Project registered for incorporation on February 23, 2005. WWP was granted accreditation as of September 10, 2008, by the Veterans Affairs Secretary as a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) ""recognized by the Secretary for the purpose of preparation, presentation, and prosecution of claims under laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs."" [19] The Veterans Administration's online List of Representatives for Accredited Organizations includes contact information for WWP's accredited service officers.[20] as well as a search tool to access information about other VSOs.[21]
 In July 2006, WWP's headquarters were moved to Jacksonville, Florida. WWP Founder John Melia cited a strong local veteran community, access to Jacksonville International Airport, and support from the local business community, specifically the PGA Tour, as the reason for the move. The WWP headquarters will be undergoing a major $1.3 million renovation according to the Jacksonville Business Journal.[22]
 On May 27, 2014, WWP filed a lawsuit against Dean Graham, a disabled veteran with PTSD, and his Help Indiana Vets, Inc. organization.[23] After a court ruling, Graham retracted the allegations he leveled against Wounded Warrior Project and folded his direct-aid non-profit.[23][verification needed]
 WWP filed a lawsuit in October 2014 seeking damages and court costs against a Blandon, Pennsylvania, non-profit, Keystone Wounded Warriors, claiming confusing similarities between Keystone's and WWP's logos; Hampton Roads, VA Channel 3 TV covered the Keystone story on April 30, 2015,[24] and Nonprofit Quarterly covered the story with a title asking, is WWP ""a 'Neighborhood Bully' among Veterans Groups?"".[24] Tim Mak also covered the suit for the Daily Beast.[25][26]
 After a reporter for the Tacoma, Washington News Tribune informed disabled veteran Airman Alex Graham, a blogger at the conspiracy website Veterans Today, of a pending lawsuit against him by the WWP, he removed his articles critical of their policies, later retracting his criticisms and issuing a public apology.[27]
 In March 2014, WWP testified before Congress that they strongly supported the bill ""To amend title 38, United States Code, to provide veterans with counseling and treatment for sexual trauma that occurred during inactive duty training (H.R. 2527; 113th Congress)"". The bill would extend a VA program of counseling and care and services for veterans for military sexual trauma that occurred during active duty or active duty for training to veterans who experienced such trauma during inactive duty training.[28] The bill would alter current law, which allows access to such counseling only to active duty members of the military, so that members of the Reserves and National Guard would be eligible.[29]
 The WWP did a study of its alumni and found that, ""almost half of the respondents indicated accessing care through VA for MST-related conditions was 'very difficult'. And of those who did not seek VA care, 41% did not know they were eligible for such care.""[30] The WWP also testified that in addition to expanding access to MST care, the VA needed to improve care itself, because veterans report ""inadequate screening, providers who were either insensitive or lacked needed expertise and facilities ill-equipped to appropriately care for MST survivors.""[30]
 In 2012, WWP spent US $114,817,090 on programs in support of wounded veterans, their families, and caregivers.[31]
 In 2013, a new employee mistakenly declined to accept a donation from Liberty Baptist Church in Fort Pierce, Florida, and issued this inadvertent statement to the church leaders in an email, ""We must decline the opportunity to be the beneficiary of your event due to our fundraising event criteria, which doesn't allow community events to be religious in nature."" [32] Shortly after the church received this letter, a WWP spokesperson apologized and said that it was a miscommunication.[33]
 In June 2015, the Daily Beast reported that the WWP sells its donor information to third parties. It also alleged that WWP distributed what it deemed an insubstantial percentage of donations to actual wounded warriors, and that it overpaid its executive staff.[34]
 In January 2016, The New York Times reported that only 60 percent of the revenue of the Wounded Warrior Project is spent on programs to help veterans; the remaining 40 percent was overhead. It also reported claims of work environment of coercion, and multiple terminations.[35] That same month, CBS News disclosed that the WWP had grown to spend millions of dollars annually on team-building events.[36]
 In March 2016, Wounded Warrior Project's board of directors dismissed the charity's top two executives, Steven Nardizzi and Al Giordano, after hiring the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett to perform an independent review of spending issues related to the company's funds. Board chairman Anthony Odierno was announced as temporarily taking control of the charity.[37]
 In October 2016, Charity Navigator dropped Wounded Warrior Project from its ""watch list"", and later boosted the nonprofit's score to a four-star rating (out of four stars).[38]
 In February 2017, the Better Business Bureau released a report clearing Wounded Warrior Project of the ""lavish spending"" allegations, and ""found the organization’s spending to be consistent with its programs and mission.""[39]
 According to a 2013 article in Nonprofit Quarterly, ""Depending on the rater, the Wounded Warriors Project seems to have scored low (Charity Watch), high (BBB Wise Giving Alliance) or somewhere in the middle (Charity Navigator)"".[40] However, for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2016, Charity Watch assigned WWP a C+ rating (up from a D originally) and Charity Navigator published its rating for WWP on 1 February 2017 as ""four out of four stars"" (up from three). As of August 2018, that rating had dropped back down to 3 stars.[41] According to Charity Navigator, WWP allocates 75.1 percent of its revenue to program expenses and 24.7 percent to fundraising and administrative expenses.[42] In January 2017 The Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance renewed its accreditation of WWP, for the next two years, as meeting the 20 standards for charity accountability.[43]"
Wyoming Wildlife Federation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming_Wildlife_Federation	"The Wyoming Wildlife Federation (WWF), established in 1937 and as of January 2019 has over 8,000 members, is Wyoming's oldest and largest statewide sportsmen/conservation organization.[1]
 The WWF mission statement declares that ""The Wyoming Wildlife Federation works for hunters, anglers, and other wildlife enthusiasts to protect and enhance habitat, to perpetuate quality hunting and fishing, to protect citizens' right to use public lands and waters, and to promote ethical hunting and fishing.""[2]
 They have worked with Wyoming Council of Trout Unlimited and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership.[3] WWF is governed by a Board of Directors, including 12 associate directors who represent the membership at large, and a number of affiliate directors who represent WWF affiliate organizations. Affiliate directors sit as ex officio members. WWF is located in Lander, WY.[4]
 WWF organizes the traditional sportsmen community regarding conservation issues. Recent WWF campaigns have included Sportsmen for the Wyoming Range, the Greater Little Mountain Coalition, and the development of both renewable (e.g., wind) and non-renewable energy (e.g., natural gas and oil shale) in wildlife habitats in Wyoming.[5] WWF has also been active in campaigns to maintain hunting and fishing access.[6] WWF has lobbied the Wyoming State Legislature on issues that affect wildlife in Wyoming.[7] WWF members are also involved in on-the-ground projects to improve wildlife habitat in Wyoming.[8]
 WWF is an affiliate of National Wildlife Federation (NWF).[9]"
Young Lives	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Lives	"Young Lives is an international research project on childhood poverty that was established in 2000 and is coordinated by a team based at the University of Oxford's Department of International Development (Queen Elizabeth House), Great Britain.
 Young Lives, by its declaration, is tracing the changing lives of 12,000 children in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh), Peru and Vietnam over a 15-year period. This is the time frame set by the UN to assess progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Through interviews, group work and case studies with the children, their parents, teachers, community representatives and others, the project is collecting information not only about their material and social circumstances, but also their perspectives on their lives and aspirations for the futures, set against the environmental and social realities of their communities.
 Young Lives is following two groups of children in each country:
 These groups provide insights into every phase of childhood. The younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves. When this is matched with information gathered about their parents, it is possible to reveal much about the inter generational transmission of poverty, how families on the margins move in and out of poverty, and the policies that can make a real difference to their lives.
 The research concentrates on 4 countries: Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh), Peru and Vietnam, chosen because they reflect a wide range of cultural, political, geographical and social contexts. They face some of the common issues experienced by developing countries, such as high debt burden, post-conflict reconstruction and adverse environmental conditions such as drought and flood. By covering these countries, Young Lives aims to reveal patterns, commonalities and differences in four very different contexts where childhood - especially childhood poverty - is changing.
 The project is core-funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID), with sub-studies funded by International Development Research Center (IDRC) (in Ethiopia), UNICEF (in India), Irish Aid (in Vietnam) and the Bernard van Leer Foundation (in India and Peru).[1]

Youth Entrepreneurs	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Entrepreneurs_Kansas	"Based in Wichita, Kansas, Youth Entrepreneurs (YE) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable educational organization.[1] Their stated goal is to provide entrepreneurship education to students in middle and high school, inspiring “students to overcome barriers and seize opportunities for the betterment of themselves and others.” [2]
 In 1991, Liz and Charles Koch founded Youth Entrepreneurs, originally an eight-week course at a Wichita high school.[3]  By 2019, the organization had grown to a presence in over 126 schools throughout the United States.[4]
 Youth Entrepreneurs states that their major objective is to provide high school students, particularly at-risk students, with business and entrepreneurial education and experiences that will help them prosper and become contributing members of society, by focusing primarily on three important objectives:[5]
 YE cites the following “Foundational Values” as the key to student success: Responsibility, Be Principled, Knowledge, Freedom, Passion, Opportunity, Sound Judgment and Win-Win Focus.”[6]
 To work towards their goals, the organization now offers year-round high school classes in which students earn high school credits for learning and applying critical thinking skills and principles of free markets and economics that can help students excel in their careers in the business world, and in their endeavors in higher education.
 In addition to earning high school credits, by 2010 YE students could begin earning college credits through YE's partnership with institutions of higher learning like Butler Community College, offering students a chance to ""get a head start on their 
college career"".[7]  As well as getting ahead in a physical sense by earning college credits, students get a head start in thinking about businesses and entrepreneurial thinking through hands-on training, and helps students more confidently dive into the business world.[8]
 Classes that run through the school year are supplemented by summer camps, like the one at Dodge City High School in Dodge City, Kansas provide students with an interactive and exciting way to practice business principles, while competing for cash prizes and receiving feedback for presented business ideas.[9]
 In 2011, YE awarded $100,000 in scholarship money to YE alumni to pursue 4-year degrees.  YE also supports alumni through mentorship programs, ensuring that they have a support structure including continuing education and networking to aid them in breaking into the business world.[10]
 The YE program has been criticized for being a platform to disseminate the Koch philosophy and to sell Charles Koch's book.  Charles and his brother David Koch were longtime supporters of the Libertarian Party before becoming Republican kingpins.  In 1980 and at the beginning of the Reagan era, the Libertarian platform proposed a drastic revision of the American education system: ""We advocate the complete separation of education and state. Government schools lead to the indoctrination of children and interfere with the free choice of individuals. Government ownership, operation, regulation, and subsidy of schools and colleges should be ended."" [11]
 YE High School posters target predominantly poor students with the premise of receiving generous financial incentives including startup capital and scholarships after graduation.  YE classes are disguised as typical high school business courses, taught in public schools by a certified teacher.  But they are actually guided by Youth Entrepreneurs, with lesson plans and class materials promoting the Koch Industries radical free-market Libertarian ideology.  Course information includes: The minimum wage hurts workers and slows economic growth.  Low taxes and less regulation allow people to prosper.  Public assistance harms the poor.  Government, in short, is the enemy of liberty.[11]
 Analysts recognize entrepreneurship as an essential part of economic development,[12] and is especially necessary in areas like the Midwestern United States that have been hit hardest by recent economic recession.[13]
 Education analyst Dr. Steve Wyckoff[14] said of YEK's role in the rehabilitation of the economy of the Midwest,
 One of the major issues we have in rural America is the shortage of jobs and businesses. If we can find those students across rural America who have a passion that can be applied in a local business, we can grow our own jobs. We're never going to get businesses to move to rural Kansas in sufficient numbers to solve the problem. It's imperative for the survival of rural America that we begin to grow our own jobs.[15] YEK works in partnership with the Network For Teaching Entrepreneurship, another international nonprofit organization dedicated to providing entrepreneurship programs to young people from low-income communities.[16]"
Youth with a Mission	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_with_a_Mission	"Youth with a Mission (YWAM, generally pronounced /ˈwaɪwæm/ WY-wam) is a Christian missionary and outreach group.
 Founded in 1960, the group's initial focus was to get youth involved in missions. Today, while maintaining its original youth-oriented ethos, the group has expanded its membership to those of older ages as well. The organization currently has tens of thousands of staff (called ""YWAMers"") working in thousands of teams and locations.[citation needed]
 Founded by American missionary Loren Cunningham and his wife Darlene Cunningham in 1960, YWAM's stated purpose is to ""know God and to make Him known"".[1][2]
 YWAM includes members from over 181 countries and a large number of Christian denominations, with over half of the organization's staff from non-Western countries. YWAM has over 15,000 full-time 'volunteers' in more than 1,100 ministry locations in over 180 countries.[3]  They train upwards of 25,000 short-term missions 'volunteers' annually.[4][5]
 Youth with a Mission was conceived by Loren Cunningham in 1956. As a 20-year-old student in an Assemblies of God College, he was traveling in the Bahamas when he had a vision of a movement that would send young people out into various nations to share the message of Jesus, and which would involve Christians of all Protestant denominations.[6][7]
 In late 1960, the name Youth with a Mission (YWAM) was chosen and the group embarked on their first project, a vocational mission trip.[8][9] The result was that YWAM sent two men in their early twenties to Liberia to build a road through the jungle to a leper colony. This was the organization's first official mission trip.[10][11]
 Loren Cunningham married Darlene Scratch in 1963. By this time, the new mission had 20 volunteers stationed in various nations, and the Cunninghams were planning the mission's first ""Summer of Service"". Later in the year, YWAM teams were being sent to West Indies, Samoa, Hawaii, Mexico, and Central America. By 1966, there were 10 full-time YWAM staff including the Cunninghams and hundreds of summer short-term volunteers. That year YWAM ministries also began in New Zealand and Tonga.[10][12]
 In 1967, Cunningham began to work on his vision for the first school. It was to be the School of Evangelism, which was held in Chateau-d'Oex (Hotel Rosat), Switzerland in 1969 with 21 students.  A second school which was twice as long, ran from the summer of 1969 through the summer of 1970 just outside Lausanne, Switzerland (in Chalet-A-Gobet).  The students' lodging and classes took place in a newly renovated and leased hotel.  By the end of the year, YWAM purchased the hotel and made Lausanne its first permanent location.[13]
 The School of Evangelism was formed in 1974 in New Jersey as well as Lausanne. With a focus on biblical foundations and character development as well as missions, much of the material from this course is now taught in the present day Discipleship Training School (DTS).[13] A format of three months of lectures followed by two or three months of outreach is still used in most Discipleship Training Schools today.[7][13]
 By 1970, YWAM had a total of 40 full-time staff.[13] In early 1972, a small team headed to Munich, Germany, to begin preparations for an outreach during the 1972 Summer Olympics.  YWAM had about 1000 people there for the outreach.  This was the first of many YWAM Olympic outreaches.
 The University of the Nations online magazine has stated that Cunningham met scientist and professor Howard V. Malmstadt at a conference in 1974. They started giving educational seminars together, and Cunningham asked Malmstadt to help expand the training arm of the mission. In 1977 YWAM purchased the Pacific Empress Hotel in Kona, Hawaii, and began renovations to turn it into the campus for what was initially called the Pacific and Asia Christian University—the forerunner of University of the Nations.[14]
 By 1978, YWAM's Mercy Ships ministry was launched with the commissioning of the ship ""Anastasis"" (the Greek word for Resurrection).[15] In 1984 the m/v Good Samaritan was added, in 1990 the m/v Pacific Ruby, then in 1994 the m/v Caribbean Mercy and then in 2001 the m/v Pacific Link. Mercy Ships was pioneered by YWAM but in 2003 was released as a separate organization.[16]   A New Zealand-based YWAM ship ministry, formerly a part of Mercy Ships called Marine Reach, which owned and operated the m/v Pacific Link continued to remain within the YWAM family and, over time, a number of ship equipped ministries sprouted up as part of the YWAM Ships network.
 By the end of the 1980s, YWAM changed the name of its university to University of the Nations (U of N). The concept of a YWAM university that would encompass training programs in hundreds of YWAM locations was developed by Cunningham and Malmstadt.[14][17] When communist regimes in Eastern Europe began to fall in the early 1990s, Youth with a Mission began outreaches to countries there, including Albania.[18]
 By 2000, YWAM had over 11,000 staff from over 130 countries and had become almost 50 percent non-Western.[19] Reflecting this diversity, in 1999, New Zealander Frank Naea, who has Samoan and Māori parentage, was chosen to become YWAM's first non-white president in 2000, replacing Jim Stier, who was to continue as international director of evangelism and frontier missions and national director for Brazil.[20] In 2000, YWAM developed a new role of Executive chairman, which Jim Stier stepped into, and made the presidency a three-year rotating position.[19] However, at a meeting in 2011 the organization's elders did away with the titles director, chairman, and president, in reference to all leadership roles except at the local level.  By 2006, YWAM had joined the International Orality Network (ION), a multi-agency outreach effort to ""the world's non-literate masses"", employing verbal and dramatic means to introduce the Gospel to populations which do not read.[21] In 2008, a number of mission organizations and church mission departments, including YWAM, started the Call To All movement, dedicated to completing the Great Commission in our time.
 YWAM is characterized as a ""family of ministries"" rather than a structured, hierarchical entity.[22] YWAM's website describes how each of YWAM's 1000+ operating centers is responsible for determining which training programs it will conduct, the character and destination of its outreaches, personnel recruitment, financial sustainment, and ministerial priorities.[23]
 YWAM sources cite the following characteristic as common to all operating locations:
A) The pre-requisite of the Discipleship Training School (DTS) for all staff.
B) The mandate to ""Know God and Make Him Known"".
C) A threefold ministry of evangelism, mercy ministry and training/discipleship.
D) A shared statement of faith, vision, and values.[23]
 Accountability is maintained through a relationship based eldership network and through the agreed YWAM core values.[24]
 According to its Statement of Faith Youth With A Mission “affirms the Bible as the authoritative word of God and, with the Holy Spirit's inspiration, the absolute reference point for every aspect of life and ministry.”[25]
YWAM teachers and leaders emphasize the following conduct in response to what they understand to be God's initiative of salvation toward humanity:
 A) Worship: A calling to praise and worship God alone.
 B) Holiness: A calling to lead holy and righteous lives that exemplify the nature and character of God.
 C) Witness: A calling to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with those who do not know Him.
 D) Prayer: A calling to engage in intercessory prayer for the people and causes on God's heart, including standing against evil in every form.
 E) Fellowship: A calling to commit to the Church in both its local nurturing expression and its mobile multiplying expression.[26]
 YWAM's values are spelled out in a document titled, The Foundational Values of Youth With A Mission. Officially, “These shared beliefs and values are the guiding principles for both the past and future growth of our mission... They are values we hold in high regard which determine who we are, how we live and how we make decisions.”[26] In February 2004, the Global Leadership Team released a revised statement of YWAM’s Foundational Values. A summary of these is as follows:
 1) Know God, 2) Make God Known, 3) Hear God's Voice, 4) Practice Worship and Intercessory Prayer, 5) Be Visionary, 6) Champion Young People, 7) Be Broad-Structured and Decentralized, 8) Be International and Interdenominational, 9) Have a Biblical Worldview 10) Function in Teams, 11) Exhibit Servant Leadership, 12) Do First, Then Teach, 13) Be Relationship-Oriented, 14) Value The Individual, 15) Value Families 16) Practice dependence on God,[24] 17) Practice Hospitality 18) Communicate with integrity[26]
 Sports camps, drama presentations, musical events, volunteering, and other creative and performing arts are among the avenues through which volunteers and staff share their Christian faith.[27]
YWAM Australia runs second-level courses that focus on Evangelism training in YWAM Perth and YWAM Whitsunday through the School of Evangelism.
 Youth with a Mission has been active in evangelism at the World Olympic Games since 1972.[28]
 The purpose of YWAM training programs is to develop the students' relationship with God and with others, to help them find God's purpose for their lives, empowering them to live Christ-like lives no matter what their vocation might be. An important concept to YWAM teaching is the notion of societal ""spheres of influence"", such as education, government, arts and entertainment, media and communication, business and commerce, family, and church.[49][50] YWAM aims to train and equip Christians to become influential within these spheres.[51]
 The various training schools of YWAM are organized under the structure of The University of the Nations (U of N).[7] The U of N offers modular courses[7] which in the USA are accredited via bi-lateral arrangements with other higher education institutions, rather than by accrediting agencies.  In some nations, e.g. Australia, certain YWAM courses are recognized by accrediting agencies.[52][53] Most schools in the U of N system have a three-month lecture phase which is then followed by a two- to three-month field assignment.[7]
 INfusion is a summer camp offered to youth ages 13-18 in Kona, Hawaii. The program has been running for approximately 10 years. INfusion is a 10-day program that takes place on the University of the Nations Kona campus. It has also been offered in Orange County, California. The focus of this program is to encourage high school-aged students to engage in their spiritual growth in a more personal and profound way, and prime them to reenter their daily lives with a God-centered mindset. INfusion's vision is that ""It's their [student's] chance to fall in love with Jesus and make Him the center of everything that they do"". In addition, INfusion offers various ""Passion Groups"" for students to join, including preaching/leadership, media, music, and sports.[54]
 The Discipleship Training School (DTS) is YWAM's entry-level training. DTSs are run in YWAM centers around the world with the purpose of teaching students about God and His purposes for humankind. The DTS encourages personal intellectual and spiritual growth and seeks to help graduates find their place serving God in the world. It also provides a foundation for students to continue their education through the U of N. The DTS generally lasts 5–6 months and consists of a 3-month lecture/study phase followed by a 2–3-month evangelistic/service outreach.[55] Some YWAM locations have utilized the relationship teachings and authorship of Eric Ludy within their given DTS program.[56]
 Many centers run DTS's that emphasize certain parts of the world or specific ministry strategies which help students use their skills and talents in world missions. DTS's are operated according to the guidelines of the YWAM International DTS Centre,[57] which was established to maintain and enhance excellence in DTS programs worldwide in accordance with the DTS purpose and curriculum guidelines set by the International Leadership of Youth with a Mission and the U of N.
 The School of Biblical Studies (SBS) is one of YWAM's many Bible training programs. Other Bible training programs offered by YWAM include the School of the Bible (SOTB), Bible School for the Nations (BSN), School of Biblical Foundations (SBF) and the Bible Core Course (BCC). SBS was founded by Ron and Judy Smith in September 1981 in Kona, Hawaii. The program is a nine-month course that uses the inductive method to study all 66 books of the Protestant Bible. SBS worldwide has now conducted about 500 schools in the last twenty-five years and have trained somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 students.[58] SOTB is an 11-month course that includes a 9-month lecture phase and a 6-week outreach. SOTB uses many methods to study through the entire Protestant Bible, including Inductive method (historical-grammatical approach), word studies, topical studies, key charts, and literary analysis among others. Other topics include effectively communicating the Bible, leadership, cross-cultural communicating and teaching skills, understanding worldviews, church history, and Biblical principles of government, education and economics.  The Bible Core Course had formerly been named the School of Biblical Studies Core Course and is a three-month school compatible with the longer SBS.  Students can either take the three-month BCC and continue on to finish the last six months of the SBS, or they can finish the BCC as a stand-alone course.[59]
 Titus Project is one of the field assignments for graduates of any SBS. It includes a 3-week teacher training time that focuses on the basics of preparing and presenting the Bible in the most effective way.
 YWAM works to help meet the practical and physical needs of the global community through its many relief and development initiatives, collectively known as Mercy Ministries International.[60]  These various YWAM ministries are spread throughout most of the locations that YWAM missionaries live and work, and range in scope from serving the poor through local feeding programs to international disaster relief teams that work in places of great need, such as the 2004 tsunami[61] and the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[62][63]
 YWAM ship equipped ministries, the maritime arm of YWAM's Mercy Ministries, uses ships to bring physical and spiritual healing to the poor and needy. YWAM ships have provided vitally important surgeries, dental care, medical supplies, food, seeds, construction materials, development projects, training, and their message to the isolated islands and rivers of the world.[64]
 Mercy Ships was the original ship-based relief ministry of YWAM, and the new ship-equipped ministries grew from the foundations laid by the Mercy Ships vision and expansive ministry.  Mercy Ships is now operationally separated from YWAM. New Zealand based YWAM ship ministry, formerly a part of Mercy Ships called Marine Reach, which owned and operated the m/v Pacific Link continued to remain within YWAM family.
 Since 2003 several other YWAM ship equipped ministries have sprouted up which are part of a growing network around the world. There are now 21 vessels in the YWAM Ships network, with more being added regularly. YWAM Ships are currently spread out from the Ob River in Siberia, Mediterranean, Colombia, Amazon River, Peru, Panama, Hawaii, Micronesia, The Marshall Islands, Alaska, New Zealand, Australia, and Papua New Guinea. Each vessel is independently owned and operated by different YWAM locations, each having their own board of directors and raising their own funds. YWAM Ship vessels include river boats, coastal ships, yachts, research vessels, small cruise ships and catamarans.
 Youth with a Mission teams internationally are involved in many relief and development ministries. Some of these ministries are under the purview of Mercy Ministries International, while many operate autonomously as simple ways of serving a local community. One of the more widely noted mercy-focused ministries is ARMS (Australian Relief & Mercy Services Ltd). ARMS (which also uses the branding 'Australian Mercy') is the Mercy Ministry arm of Youth with a Mission, Australia.  ARMS is a registered Christian development and aid organization that cares for the poor and needy both within Australia and overseas. ARMS works in nations such as East Timor, Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, India, Zambia, Vietnam and China. It provides medical support to communities as well as disaster relief teams that serve in natural disasters and war zones. It also supports preschools and orphanages in poor communities, runs primary health care programs, and is also involved in building and construction, water and agricultural projects. In recent years ARMS has launched the Buzz Off campaign against malaria.
[65]
 In 2009 ARMS launched the Donna McDermid memorial fund a funding initiative to help address gender injustice issues and sexual abuse in the developing world. The fund seeks to raise the profile of issues such as, bride burning, female genital mutilation, child brides, breast ironing, sexual abuse, sex trafficking.[66]
 Various YWAM ministries took part in relief efforts in Louisiana and surrounding states after Hurricane Katrina and Rita.[67]
 Youth with a Mission was also involved in disaster relief and grief counseling after the 2004 tsunami. tsunami relief by YWAM staff took place in India, Thailand, and Indonesia in both the immediate aftermath of the tsunami and is reported to still continue in some areas.[61][68]
 Flooding in Pakistan in 2007 in the Sindh province prompted a response by twenty Muslim, Christian, and Hindu volunteers led by YWAM Pakistan. They were assisted by an appeal made through YWAM London's disaster relief|relief office. Various YWAM entities in Pakistan were able to distribute food for a month to 3,000 of the 150,000 homeless survivors there.[69]
 Additionally, the ARMS ministry RescueNet has sent medical and SAR interventions teams to Iraq in 2003, the Philippines in 2004, Pakistan in 2006, Samoa 2009, Indonesia 2009 and Haiti 2010.  ARMS has also sent [8] intervention medical teams to East Timor in 2006.[70]
 Hurricane Katrina flooded all eleven of YWAM New Orleans' buildings. Personnel were evacuated to YWAM bases in Baton Rouge and Tyler, Texas, where volunteers in their MercyWorks relief arm prepared to take food, ""baby items"" and water to victims once access was granted to relief workers by the National Guard.[71] Earlier that year, YWAM lodgings in Phuket, Thailand were destroyed by the tsunami of 26 December 2004.[72]
 In Uganda, YWAM is working with villagers to provide relief for HIV/AIDS. They have established orphanages and are ensuring children are educated. British singer, Lemar visited the project in Soroti in 2007.[73][74]
 In 2007, ARMS announced a new ministry focus – an international campaign against Malaria called Buzz Off.[75] The campaign is aimed at empowering smaller NGOs and ministries working in Malaria endemic nations to tackle the problem of Malaria at the local level. In from 2009 to 2010 Buzz Off fed resources into Burmese Internally Displaced People camps providing LLIN mosquito nets into IDP areas through already established health networks. Some funding organizations in Australia are getting behind the work that Buzz Off is doing with the IDPs.[76]
 YWAM San Diego is actively involved in building homes for families in Mexico through its Homes of Hope ministry. According to Sean Lambert, president of YWAM San Diego/Baja, teams participating with his base have built 2,084 homes for needy families since 1991.[77][78] Teams purchase the housing materials and, optionally, furniture. These teams then travel to Tijuana or Ensenada, Mexico to build the house with YWAM staff overseeing the project.[79]  In recent years the work has expanded throughout the Caribbean into the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Panama.[80]  According to their website, Homes of Hope has built a total of 4,300 homes in 16 different nations.
 Despite its historical and value emphasis on young people, YWAM involves people of all ages. However, there is still a core emphasis on youth ministry. While YWAM has many programs focusing on youth ministry, within the larger organization it has developed three transnational ministries for youth: Mission Adventures (MA), King's Kids International (KKI) and Youth Street. YWAM holds an annual spring event offering free dentistry to children in Lindale, TX. The ministry is first come, first served; while thousands are given free treatment, thousands more are turned away, sometimes coming from many states away.[81] In 1973, Pastor David E. Ross founded YWAM Korea, and has launched a campus ministry where word meditation sessions, prayer meetings and worship services are held on campus.[82] Currently, in South Korea, total of 120 universities have YWAM campus ministries[citation needed] with 150 assistant administrators and 8 university disciples training schools.[83]
 YWAM Missionary Lee Isaac Chung's film Munyurangabo (Liberation Day) earned Un Certain Regard at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Chung cast two street kids whom he found through YWAM's soccer-outreach program as the stars of a film that dealt with the moral and emotional repercussions of the Rwandan Genocide.[84]
 David Loren Cunningham, son of the group's founders, recently produced a controversial film titled Hakani: A Survivor's Story, which contains a depiction of infanticide among Amazonian tribes of Brazil. The film gave new vigor to the debate on human rights regarding indigenous people.[85]
 YWAM also runs film and acting courses, which are offered in places like Kona,Hawaii and Brisbane, Australia.
 Create International, a media ministry of Youth with a Mission, has produced documentary and evangelistic films for over 50 of the world's least-reached people groups. These films are free for all Christian workers to utilize in their evangelism and church planting efforts among unreached peoples. These films can be downloaded on their website at http://www.indigitech.net  Create International has initiated a campaign called the, ""20/20 Vision"" which plans to create partnerships with local churches, media professionals, and other mission agencies ""To produce and distribute an indigenous evangelistic audio-visual tool for every one of the Least Evangelized Mega Peoples by the year 2020, so that all can clearly see and understand the gospel message and embrace it as their own"". http://www.global2020vision.com
 Youth With A Mission is a global mission with international partnerships. Former chairman Lynn Green recently reported that YWAM representatives sometimes sit ""on boards of other commissions"" and organizations.[7]
 YWAM also works closely with various missions and churches, as well as independent missionaries across the globe. Through these connections, YWAM has sometimes grown by taking over local independent ministries.  One example of this is the story of its affiliate in Korea, Jesus Evangelism Team, which joined YWAM in the early 1980s.
 A notable working relationship is the OneStory Project[86] which is a partnership between YWAM, Campus Crusade for Christ, the International Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, Trans World Radio, and Wycliffe Bible Translators as well as other Great Commission-focused organizations, churches and individuals.[87] United Bible Societies has also worked closely with YWAM as a missions partner.[41] YWAM joined with the Evangelical Alliance and John C. Maxwell to design the training program for the Global Pastors Network's Million Leaders Mandate.[88] YWAM and Christian Direction work together to pray for Muslims during Ramadan.[89] YWAM Pittsburgh has been involved in ecumenical local efforts to revive Epiphany School through teaching young people ""Christian principles"" and exposing them to dance and the arts.[90]
 YWAM partners with:
 YWAM is a member of:
 A gunman identified as an expelled YWAM student, Matthew Murray,[97] shot four staff members at the missionary training center near Denver in the early morning hours on December 9, 2007, killing two.[98]
 YWAM's School of Writing director Janice Rogers noted that internationally, YWAM had been the victim of violent offenders before, including homicides and other violent acts, although this was the first act of aggression against the mission on US soil.[99]
 In January 2018, Pablo Rivera, the chief financial officer for University of the Nations at YWAM-Kona, pled guilty to wire fraud. [7] Rivera embezzled nearly 3.1 million dollars, amounting to $50,000 per month. According to the YWAM school leadership, in order to compensate for the fraud, increased charges were applied to volunteers and students. [8]According to the Department of Justice press release, Rivera used fraudulent invoices from an outside contractor [9]to supplement his lavish lifestyle; this included plastic surgery, failed stock market investments and a gold mine in Sierra Leone. [10]
 Youth with A Mission has no official political affiliations. The YWAM.org website states: ""Individual YWAM staff and students come from a wide variety of political backgrounds and affiliations."" [100]
 In 1989, Sara Diamond's book Spiritual Warfare mentioned a meeting in the United States between various Christian leaders (including YWAM Founder Loren Cunningham) and Efraín Ríos Montt, who led a coup in Guatemala from 1982-1983, implying a connection with Christian evangelicalism.[101] Diamond also suggested that YWAM ""sought to gain influence within the Republican party.""
 In 2009, YWAM was linked to property used for hosting Bible studies, prayer meetings, and as boarding facilities for members of the US Congress.[102]
 In 1975, YWAM's founder Loren Cunningham, along with Bill Bright of Campus Crusade spoke of the importance of influencing seven main segments or spheres of society and culture (Family, Celebration, Religion, Government, Education, Science, Media).[103][104] One of these segments included ""fighting a spiritual battle to redeem the area of government"". While the group maintains that its teachings aimed only to promote moral service for Christian citizens, others interpreted the segment as an effort to influence secular governance with evangelical Christian ideals.[105]
 There have been complaints about the way some people have been treated by authority figures during their time in YWAM.[106][107][108]
For example, the website of the International Cultic Studies Association hosts an article which describes in some detail an experience of spiritual abuse on a DTS course in Hawaii. In this incident the author and two other women fled in the dead of night for fear of serious damage to their mental health.[109][110]
 The Apologetics Index also lists a number of personal accounts of spiritual abuse within the organisation. The website's founder was himself a victim of such abuse at the hands of one of YWAM's most important leaders, Floyd McClung. Talking about McClung, the author writes: ""While I have forgiven the spiritual abuse and accepted his reluctant apologies ... the abuse has had far-reaching consequences, the scars of which I still bear.""  [111]
 He also quotes Harold Busséll, author of By Hook or by Crook : How Cults Lure Christians: ""While living in Europe, my wife and I were involved with an Evangelical youth mission based in Switzerland. We were with the group only six weeks, but it was almost seven years before I had overcome the psychological damage caused by their cult-like control and spiritualization … Questioning a leader was considered an act of rebellion against God and His chain of command.""[112]
 The Christian Research Institute also say they have received complaints about YWAM.[106] In 1990, cult consultant Rick Ross published an evaluation of Youth with a Mission, that cited both positive and negative aspects of YWAM.[108] After the 2007 shootings, Ross told the Fox News Network that he continued to receive occasional ""serious complaints"" about Youth with a Mission, but he believed it is ""not a cult"" .""[98] Some of the political involvements of its founders and members have also been examined by the media.[101][113][114][115]
 Evangelical theologians Alan Gomes and E. Calvin Beisner believe certain doctrines taught to young missionaries at some YWAM locations from the 1970s until the 1990s to be unorthodox. These doctrines include Moral Government Theology. Moral Government Theology adherents such as Gordon Olson, Harry Conn and Winkie Pratney taught classes based on this teaching to young missionaries during this time period.[116][117]"
YouthBuild	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouthBuild	"YouthBuild is a non-profit organization which on a voluntary bases provides education, counseling and job skills to unemployed young American adults (between ages 16 and 24), generally high school dropouts. There are 273 YouthBuild programs in the United States, with a total capacity of about 10,000 students yearly, and there are similar programs underway in over 15 countries. [1] The headquarters are in Somerville, Massachusetts.[2]
 The YouthBuild program has five components: construction, education, counseling, leadership, and graduate opportunity.  Students spend every other week on a job site, learning the construction trade by building homes for their own communities.  This creates housing for low-income people, and also gives the students marketable job skills.  The alternate weeks are spent on education in the YouthBuild classroom, with the goal of attaining a GED or completing their high school diploma.  Many YouthBuild students come directly from the streets or from difficult life situations, so counseling is available to help them deal with anger management, family responsibilities, and other adjustment / life direction issues.  Leadership is taught explicitly in YouthBuild programs, based on the philosophy that young people are not a burden, but rather a resource to be tapped.  This, combined with ensuring opportunity and placement for graduates, means that many YouthBuild graduates go on to college, work in the non-profit sector, serve on committees, or even run in local politics.
 Funding for YouthBuild previously came primarily from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but has transitioned to the Department of Labor.  Other funding sources for programs are widely varied, but include other government agencies, private foundations, corporations, and individual donors.
 Founded and directed by Dorothy Stoneman and John Bell [1], one of the main purposes of YouthBuild is to build affordable housing for low-income families. Since 1994, more than 19,000 homes have been built by 92,000 YouthBuild students."

 A charitable trust is an irrevocable trust established for charitable purposes and, in some jurisdictions, a more specific term than ""charitable organization"". A charitable trust enjoys a varying degree of tax benefits in most countries. It also generates good will. Some important terminology in charitable trusts is the term ‘corpus’ (Latin for ‘body’) which refers to the assets with which the trust is funded and the term ‘donor’ which is the person donating assets to a charity.[1]
 In India, trusts  set up for the social causes and  approved by the Income Tax Department get not only exemption from payment of tax but also the donors to such trusts can deduct the amount of donation to the trust from their taxable income.[2] The legal framework in India recognizes activities including ""relief of the poor, education, medical relief, preserving monuments and environment, and the advancement of any other object of general public utility"" as charitable purposes.[3] Companies formed under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2017 for promoting charity also receive benefits under law including exemption from various procedural provisions of the Companies Act, either fully or in part, and are also entitled to such other exemptions that the Central Government may accord through its orders.[4]
 In the Islamic Republic of Iran religious charitable trusts, or bonyads, make up a substantial part of the country's economy, controlling an estimated 20% of Iran's GDP. Unlike some other Muslim-majority countries, the bonyads receive large and controversial subsidies from the Iranian government.[5]
 In England and Wales, charitable trusts are a form of express trust dedicated to charitable goals. There are a variety of advantages to charitable trust status, including exemption from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust.[6] To be a valid charitable trust, the organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit.[7] Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into four categories; trusts for the relief of poverty, trusts for the promotion of education, trusts for the promotion of religion, and all other types of trust recognised by the law, which includes trusts for the benefit of animals and trusts for the benefit of a locality. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.[8]
 Such trusts will be invalid in several circumstances; charitable trusts are not allowed to be run for profit,[9] nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose).[10] In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable.[11] Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries.[6] This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.[12]
 Jurisdiction over charitable disputes is shared equally between the High Court of Justice and the Charity Commission.[13] The Commission, the first port of call, is tasked with regulating and promoting charitable trusts, as well as providing advice and opinions to trustees on administrative matters.[14] Where the Commission feels there has been mismanagement or maladministration, it can sanction the trustees, removing them, appointing new ones or temporarily taking the trust property itself to prevent harm being done.[13] Where there are flaws with a charity, the High Court can administer schemes directing the function of the charity.[15]
 In the United States, many individuals use charitable trusts to leave all or a portion of their estate to charity when they die, both for philanthropic purposes and for certain tax benefits. Charitable trusts may be set up inter vivos (during a donor's life) or as a part of a trust or will at death (testamentary). There are two basic types of US charitable trusts- charitable remainder trusts and charitable lead trusts.
 Charitable remainder trusts are irrevocable structures established by a donor to provide an income stream to the income beneficiary, while the public charity or private foundation receives the remainder value when the trust terminates. These ""split interest"" trusts are defined in §664 of the Internal Revenue Code and are normally tax-exempt. A section 664 trust makes its payments, either of a fixed amount (charitable remainder annuity trust) or a percentage of trust principal (charitable remainder unitrust),[16] to either the donor or another named beneficiary. If the trust qualifies under IRS code, the donor may claim a charitable income tax deduction for their donation to the trust. Additionally, the donor may not have to pay an immediate capital gains tax when the trust disposes of the appreciated asset and purchases other income-generating assets to fund the trust. At the end of the trust term, which may be based on either lives or a term of years, the charity receives whatever amount is left in the trust.[17] Charitable remainder unitrusts provide some flexibility in the distribution of income, and may be helpful in retirement planning, while charitable remainder annuity trusts paying a fixed dollar amount are more rigid and usually appeal to much older donors unconcerned about inflation's impact on income distributions who are using cash or marketable securities to fund the trust.[18]
 Charitable lead trusts are the opposite of charitable remainder trusts and first make payments to charity for the term of the trust.  As with charitable remainder trust, payments may be either of a fixed amount (charitable lead annuity trust) or a percentage of trust principal (charitable lead unitrust). At the end of the trust term, the remainder can either go back to the donor or to heirs named by the donor. The donor may sometimes claim a charitable income tax deduction or a gift/estate tax deduction for making a lead trust gift, depending on the type of a charitable lead trust. Generally, a non-grantor lead trust does not generate a current income tax deduction, but it eliminates the asset (or part of the asset's value) from the donor's estate.[19]"
List of foundations in Canada	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foundations_in_Canada	"This is a list of foundations in Canada. Foundations in Canada collectively comprise a very large asset base for philanthropy.  As of 2003, there were over 2,000 active grantmaking foundations in Canada, who had total assets of $12.5 billion CAD, with total grants given that year of over $1 billion CAD.  Under Canadian law, foundations may be public or private, but both are charities.
 The following is a list of foundations in Canada that have at least $10 million CAD in assets, as per their most recent Registered Charity Information Return with the Canada Revenue Agency.  They are ordered alphabetically.  All figures are in Canadian dollars."
List of water-related charities	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_water-related_charities	"This is a list of water-related charities, charitable organizations working around the world on problems related to water provision, water sanitation, water quality, access to water, and related topics.[1]"
List of wealthiest charitable foundations	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_charitable_foundations	"This is a list of wealthiest charitable foundations worldwide.  It consists of the 40 largest charitable foundations, private foundations engaged in philanthropy, and other charitable organizations that have disclosed their assets.  In many countries such disclosure is not legally required, and often not done.
 Only nonprofit foundations are included in this list. Organisations that are part of a larger company are excluded, such as holding companies.
 The entries are ordered by the size of the organisation's financial endowment (that is, the value of assets net of liabilities, or invested donations). The endowment value is an estimate measured in United States dollars, based on the exchange rates on December 31, 2016[1]. Due to fluctuations in holdings, currency exchange and asset values, this list only represents the valuation of each foundation on a single day."
Youth philanthropy	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_philanthropy	"Youth philanthropy is the donation of time, energy or resources, including money, by children and youth towards philanthropic causes. According to one study, ""youth philanthropy is, at the broadest level, youth giving of their time, talents and treasure.""[1] It is seen as an effective means in which youth develop knowledge of and participate in philanthropic projects such as volunteering, grant writing, and community service.[2]
 Youth philanthropy educates young people about social change in order to identify community problems and design the most appropriate solutions in a systemic way.[3] Philanthropy in this case is defined as anything young people do to make the world around them a better place.[4]
 Focused on youth-adult partnerships and youth voice, youth philanthropy is seen as a successful application of service learning.[5] Youth philanthropy helps young people develop skills, knowledge, confidence and leadership abilities.[6] Youth philanthropy is also identified as a particularly effective means for educating children and youth about volunteerism and civic engagement.[7]
 Within the Jewish community institutions such as synagogues, day schools, Jewish federations and other organizations have created Jewish youth philanthropy programs to provide Jewish teens with opportunities to engage in grantmaking activities through a Jewish lens. The Jewish Teen Funders Network serves as a central address for Jewish youth philanthropy, and aims to help grow and strengthen the burgeoning field.[8]
 Another worthy society that is highly philanthropic are the Boy Scouts of America.  The entire system of Scouting values were based on the values of community service and leadership in helping the community.  The Order of the Arrow, a branch of the Boy Scouts that idolizes cheerful service, donate large amounts of time in helping the community also."
Charitable giving	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_(practice)	"The practice of charity means the voluntary giving of help to those in need, as a humanitarian act. There are a number of philosophies about charity, often associated with religion. Effective altruism is the use of evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.
 The word charity originated in late Old English to mean a ""Christian love of one's fellows,""[1] and up until at least the beginning of the 20th century, this meaning remained synonymous with charity.[2][3][4][5] Aside from this original meaning, charity is etymologically linked to Christianity, with the word originally entering into the English language through the Old French word ""charité"", which was derived from the Latin ""caritas"", a word commonly used in the Vulgate New Testament to translate the Greek word agape (ἀγάπη), a distinct form of ""love""[6] (see the article: Charity (virtue)).
 Over time, the meaning of charity has shifted from one of ""Christian love"" to that of ""providing for those in need; generosity and giving,""[7][1] a transition which began with the Old French word charité.[6] Thus, while the older Douay-Rheims and King James versions of the Bible translate instances of ""agape"" (such as those that appear in 1 Corinthians 13) as ""charity"", modern English versions of the Bible typically translate ""agape"" as  ""love.""[8]
 Charitable giving is the act of giving money, goods or time to the unfortunate, either directly or by means of a charitable trust or other worthy cause.[9]  Charitable giving as a religious act or duty is referred to as almsgiving or alms. The name stems from the most obvious expression of the virtue of charity; giving the recipients of it the means they need to survive. The impoverished, particularly those widowed or orphaned, and the ailing or injured, are generally regarded as the proper recipients of charity. The people who cannot support themselves and lack outside means of support sometimes become ""beggars"", directly soliciting aid from strangers encountered in public.
 Some groups regard charity as being distributed towards other members from within their particular group. Although giving to those nearly connected to oneself is sometimes called charity—as in the saying ""Charity begins at home""—normally charity denotes giving to those not related, with filial piety and like terms for supporting one's family and friends.  Indeed, treating those related to the giver as if they were strangers in need of charity has led to the figure of speech ""as cold as charity""—providing for one's relatives as if they were strangers, without affection.[10]
 Most forms of charity are concerned with providing basic necessities such as food, water, clothing, healthcare and shelter, but other actions may be performed as charity:  visiting the imprisoned or the homebound, ransoming captives, educating orphans, even social movements. Donations to causes that benefit the unfortunate indirectly, such as donations to fund cancer research, are also charity.
 With regards to religious aspects, the recipient of charity may offer to pray for the benefactor. In medieval Europe, it was customary to feast the poor at the funeral in return for their prayers for the deceased.  Institutions may commemorate benefactors by displaying their names, up to naming buildings or even the institution itself after the benefactors.  If the recipient makes material return of more than a token value, the transaction is normally not called charity.
 In the past[which?] century, many charitable organizations have created a ""charitable model"" in which donators give to conglomerates give to recipients. Examples of this include the Make a Wish Foundation (John Cena holds the title for most wishes granted by a single individual, with over 450 wishes) and the World Wildlife Fund. Today some charities have modernized, and allow people to donate online, through websites such as JustGiving. Originally charity entailed the benefactor directly giving the goods to the receiver.  This practice was continued by some individuals, for example, ""CNN Hero"" Sal Dimiceli, and service organizations, such as the Jaycees. With the rise of more social peer-to-peer processes, many charities are moving away from the charitable model and starting to adopt this more direct donator to recipient approach. Examples of this include Global Giving (direct funding of community development projects in developing countries), DonorsChoose (for US-based projects), PureCharity, Kiva (funding loans administered by microfinance organizations in developing countries) and Zidisha (funding individual microfinance borrowers directly).
 Institutions evolved to carry out the labor of assisting the poor, and these institutions, called charities, provide the bulk of charitable giving today, in terms of monetary value.  These include orphanages, food banks, religious institutes dedicated to care of the poor, hospitals, organizations that visit the homebound and imprisoned, and many others.  Such institutions allow those whose time or inclination does not lend themselves to directly care for the poor to enable others to do so, both by providing money for the work and supporting them while they do the work.  Institutions can also attempt to more effectively sort out the actually needy from those who fraudulently claim charity.  Early Christians particularly recommended the care of the unfortunate to the charge of the local bishop.
 There have been examinations of who gives more to charity.  One study conducted in the United States found that as a percentage of income, charitable giving increased as income decreased.  The poorest fifth of Americans, for example, gave away 4.3% of their income, while the wealthiest fifth gave away 2.1%.  In absolute terms, this was an average of $453 on an average income of $10,531, compared to $3,326 on an income of $158,388.[11]
 A philosophical critique of charity can be found in Oscar Wilde's The Soul of Man, where he calls it ""a ridiculously inadequate mode of partial restitution . . . usually accompanied by some impertinent attempt on the part of the sentimentalist to tyrannise over [the poor's] private lives"", as well as a remedy that prolongs the ""disease"" of poverty, rather than curing it.[12]
Wilde's thoughts are cited with approval by Slavoj Žižek, and the Slovenian thinker adds his description of the effect of charity on the charitable:
 When, confronted with the starving child, we are told: ""For the price of a couple of cappuccinos, you can save her life!"", the true message is: ""For the price of a couple of cappuccinos, you can continue in your ignorant and pleasurable life, not only not feeling any guilt, but even feeling good for having participated in the struggle against suffering!"" Friedrich Engels, in his 1845 treatise on the condition of the working class in England, points out that charitable giving, whether by governments or individuals, is often seen by the givers as a means to conceal suffering that is unpleasant to see. Engels quotes from a letter to the editor of an English newspaper who complains that
 The English bourgeoisie, Engels concludes,
 The Institute of Economic Affairs published a report in 2012 called ""Sock Puppets: How the government lobbies itself and why"", which criticised the phenomenon of governments funding charities which then lobby the government for changes which the government wanted all along.[14]
 In medieval Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, Latin Christendom underwent a charitable revolution.[15]  Rich patrons founded many leprosaria and hospitals for the sick and poor. New confraternities and religious orders emerged with the primary mission of engaging in intensive charitable work. Historians debate the causes. Some argue that this movement was spurred by economic and material forces, as well as a burgeoning urban culture. Other scholars argue that developments in spirituality and devotional culture were central. For still other scholars, medieval charity was primarily a way to elevate one's social status and affirm existing hierarchies of power.[16]
 In Judaism, tzedakah—a Hebrew term literally meaning righteousness but commonly used to signify charity[17]—refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just.[18] Because it is commanded by the Torah and not voluntary, the practice is not technically an act of charity; such a concept is virtually nonexistent in Jewish tradition. Jews give tzedakah, which can take the form of money, time and resources to the needy, out of ""righteousness"" and ""justice"" rather than benevolence, generosity, or charitableness.[18] The Torah requires that 10 percent of a Jew's income be allotted to righteous deeds or causes, regardless if the receiving party is rich or poor.
 In Islam there are two methods of charity.
 One called Zakat, the other is called Sadaqa.
 Zakat is one of the five pillars upon which the Muslim religion is based, where 2.5% of one's saving is compulsory to be given as Zakat per Islamic calendar year, provided that the saving is beyond the threshold limit, called Nisab, usually determined by the religious authority.
 Sadaqa is voluntary charity or contribution. Sadaqa can be given using money, personal items, time or other resources. There is no minimum or maximum requirement for Sadaqa. Even smiling to other people is considered a Sadaqa.[19]
 The practice of charity is called Dāna or Daana in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It is the virtue of generosity or giving.[20][21] Dāna has been defined in traditional texts, state Krishnan and Manoj,[22] as “any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return”. Karna, Mahabali and Harishchandra are heroes also known for giving charity.
 The earliest known discussion of charity as a virtuous practice, in Indian texts, is in Rigveda.[23][24] According to other ancient texts of Hinduism, dāna can take the form of feeding or giving to an individual in distress or need.[25] It can also take the form of philanthropic public projects that empower and help many.[26][27][28]
 Dāna leads to one of the perfections (pāramitā). This can be characterized by unattached and unconditional generosity, giving and letting go.[29]
 Historical records, such as those by the Persian historian Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī who visited India in early 11th century, suggest dāna has been an ancient and medieval era practice among Indian religions.[30][31]
 Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.[32] Effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact, based upon their values.[33] It is the broad, evidence-based and cause-neutral approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity.[34] Effective altruism is part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices.
 While a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector, the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects, companies, and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives, help people, or otherwise have the biggest benefit.[35] People associated with the movement include philosopher Peter Singer,[36] Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz,[37] Cari Tuna,[38] Ben Delo,[39] Oxford-based researchers William MacAskill[40] and Toby Ord,[41] professional poker player Liv Boeree,[42][43] and writer Jacy Reese.[44]"
Alms	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alms	"Alms (/ɑːmz/, /ɑːlmz/) or almsgiving involves giving to others as an act of virtue, either materially or in the sense of providing capabilities (e.g. education) free. It exists in a number of religions and regions. The word, in the modern English language, comes from the Old English ælmesse, ælmes, from Late Latin eleemosyna, from Greek ἐλεημοσύνη eleēmosynē (""pity, alms""), from ἐλεήμων, eleēmōn (""merciful""), from ἔλεος, eleos (""pity"").
 In Judaism, tzedakah - a Hebrew term literally meaning righteousness but commonly used to signify charity [1] - refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just.[2] Contemporary tzedakah is regarded as a continuation of the Biblical Maaser Ani, or poor-tithe, as well as Biblical practices including permitting the poor to glean the corners of a field, harvest during the Shmita (Sabbatical year), and other practices. Tzedakah, along with prayer and repentance, is regarded as ameliorating the consequences of bad acts.
 In Judaism, Tzedakah (charity) is seen as one of the greatest deeds that man can do.[3] Jewish farmers are commanded to leave the corners of their fields for the starving to harvest for food and are forbidden to pick up any grain that has been dropped during harvesting, as such food shall be left for the starving as well.
 Famous Jewish scholar and sage Maimonides has been noted for creating a list of charity, with the most righteous form being allowing an individual to become self-sustaining and capable of giving others charity. [4]
 In Islam, the concept of charitable giving is generally divided into voluntary giving, or Sadaqah, and the Zakat, an obligatory practice governed by a specific set of rules within Islamic jurisprudence, and intended to fulfill a well-defined set of theological and social requirements.  For that reason, while Zakat plays a much larger role within Islamic charity, Sadaqah is possibly a better translation of Christian influenced formulations of the notion of 'alms'.
 Zakat is the third of the five pillars of Islam.[5][6] Various rules attach to the practice but, in general terms, it is obligatory to give 2.5% of one's savings and business revenue and 5–10% of one's harvest to the poor. Possible recipients include the destitute, the working poor, those who are unable to pay off their own debts, stranded travelers and others who need assistance, with the general principle of zakaah always being that the rich should pay it to the poor. One of the most important principles of Islam is that all things belong to God and, therefore, wealth is held by human beings in trust.
 The literal meaning of the word Zakat is ""to purify"", ""to develop"" and ""cause to grow"". According to Shariah it is an act of worship. Our possessions are purified by setting aside a proportion for those in need. This cutting back, like the pruning of plants, balances and encourages new growth.
 Zakat is the amount of money that every adult, mentally stable, free, and financially able Muslim, male or female, has to pay to support specific categories of people.
 This category of people is defined in surah at-Taubah (9) verse 60: ""The alms are only for the poor and the needy, and those who collect them, and those whose hearts are to be reconciled, and to free the captives and the debtors, and for the cause of Allah, and (for) the wayfarers; a duty imposed by Allah. Allah is knower, Wise."" (The Holy Qur'an 9:60).
 The obligatory nature of Zakat is firmly established in the Qur'an, the Sunnah (or hadith), and the consensus of the companions and the Muslim scholars. Allah states in Surah at-Taubah verses 34–35: ""O ye who believe! there are indeed many among the priests and anchorites, who in Falsehood devour the substance of men and hinder (them) from the way of Allah. And there are those who bury gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah. announce unto them a most grievous penalty – On the Day when heat will be produced out of that (wealth) in the fire of Hell, and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs.- ""This is the (treasure) which ye buried for yourselves: taste ye, then, the (treasures) ye buried!"" (The Holy Qur'an 9:34–35).
 Muslims of each era have agreed upon the obligatory nature of paying Zakat for gold and silver, and from those the other kinds of currency.
 Zakat is obligatory when a certain amount of money, called the nisab is reached or exceeded. Zakat is not obligatory if the amount owned is less than this nisab. The nisab (or minimum amount) of gold and golden currency is 20 mithqal, approximately 85 grams of pure gold. One mithqal is approximately 4.25 grams. The nisab of silver and silver currency is 200 dirhams, which is approximately 595 grams of pure silver. The nisab of other kinds of money and currency is to be scaled to that of gold; the nisab of money is equivalent to the price of 85 grams of 999-type (pure) gold, on the day in which Zakat is paid.
 Zakat is obligatory after the money has been in the control of its owner for the span of one lunar year. Then the owner needs to pay 2.5% (or 1/40) of the money as Zakat. (A lunar year is approximately 355 days). The owner should deduct any amount of money he or she borrowed from others; then check if the rest reaches the necessary nisab, then pays Zakat for it.
 If the owner had enough money to satisfy the nisab at the beginning of the year, but his wealth in any form increased, the owner needs to add the increase to the nisab amount owned at the beginning of the year, then pay Zakat, 2.5%, of the total at the end of the lunar year. There are minor differences between fiqh school on how this is to be calculated. Each Muslim calculates his or her own Zakat individually. For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half percent of one's capital.
 A pious person may also give as much as he or she pleases as sadaqa, and does so preferably in secret. Although this word can be translated as 'voluntary charity' it has a wider meaning. The Prophet said 'Even meeting your brother with a cheerful face is charity.'
 The Prophet said: 'Charity is a necessity for every Muslim.' He was asked: 'What if a person has nothing?' The Prophet  replied: 'He should work with his own hands for his benefit and then give something out of such earnings in charity.' The Companions asked: 'What if he is not able to work?' The Prophet  said: 'He should help poor and needy persons.' The Companions further asked 'What if he cannot do even that?' The Prophet said 'He should urge others to do good.' The Companions said 'What if he lacks that also?' The Prophet said 'He should check himself from doing evil. That is also charity.'
 In Buddhism, alms or almsgiving is the respect given by a lay Buddhist to a Buddhist monk, nun, spiritually-developed person or other sentient being. It is not charity as presumed by Western interpreters. It is closer to a symbolic connection to the spiritual realm and to show humbleness and respect in the presence of the secular society.[note 1] The act of alms giving assists in connecting the human to the monk or nun and what he/she represents. As the Buddha has stated:
 Householders & the homeless or charity [monastics]
in mutual dependence
both reach the true Dhamma....
 In Theravada Buddhism, nuns (Pāli: bhikkhunis) and monks (Pāli: bhikkhus) go on a daily almsround (pindacara) to collect food (piṇḍapāta). This is often perceived as giving the laypeople the opportunity to make merit (Pāli: puñña). Money cannot be accepted by a Theravadan Buddhist monk or nun in lieu of or in addition to food, as the Patimokkha training rules make it an offence worth forfeiture and confession.[8]
 In countries that follow Mahayana Buddhism, the practice of a daily alms round has mostly died out. In China, Korea and Japan, local cultures resisted the idea of giving food to 'begging' clerics, and there was no tradition of gaining 'merit' by donating to practitioners. After periods of persecution, monasteries were situated in remote mountain areas in which the distance between the monastery and the nearest towns would make a daily alms round impossible. In Japan, the practice of a weekly or monthly takuhatsu replaced the daily round. In the Himalayan countries, the large number of bikshus would have made an almsround a heavy burden on families. Competition with other religions for support also made daily almsrounds difficult and even dangerous; the first Buddhist monks in the Silla dynasty of Korea were said to be beaten due to their minority at the time.[citation needed]
 In Buddhism, both ""almsgiving"" and, more generally, ""giving"" are called ""dāna"" (Pāli).[9] Such giving is one of the three elements of the path of practice as formulated by the Buddha for laypeople. This path of practice for laypeople is: dāna, sīla, bhāvanā.[10]
 The paradox in Buddhism is that the more a person gives – and the more one gives without seeking something in return – the wealthier (in the broadest sense of the word) one will become.[citation needed] By giving one destroys those acquisitive impulses that ultimately lead to further suffering. Generosity is also expressed towards other sentient beings as both a cause for merit and to aid the receiver of the gift. In Mahayana Tradition it is accepted that although the three jewels of refuge are the basis of the greatest merit, by seeing other sentient beings as having Buddhanature and making offerings towards the aspirational Buddha to be within them is of equal benefit. Generosity towards other sentient beings is greatly emphasised in Mahayana as one of the perfections (paramita) as shown in Lama Tsong Khapa's 'The Abbreviated Points of the Graded Path' (Tibetan: lam-rim bsdus-don):
 Total willingness to give is the wish-granting gem for fulfilling the hopes of wandering beings.
It is the sharpest weapon to sever the knot of stinginess.
It leads to bodhisattva conduct that enhances self-confidence and courage,
And is the basis for universal proclamation of your fame and repute.
Realizing this, the wise rely, in a healthy manner, on the outstanding path
Of (being ever-willing) to offer completely their bodies, possessions, and positive potentials.
The ever-vigilant lama has practiced like that.
If you too would seek liberation,
Please cultivate yourself in the same way.[11]
 In Buddhism, giving of alms is the beginning of one's journey to Nirvana (Pali: nibbana). In practice, one can give anything with or without thought for Nibbana. This would lead to faith (Pali: saddha), one key power (Pali: bala) that one should generate within oneself for the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha.
 The motives behind giving play an important role in developing spiritual qualities. The suttas record various motives for exercising generosity. For example, the Anguttara Nikaya (A.iv,236) enumerates the following eight motives:[12]
 According to the Pali canon:
 Of all gifts [alms], the gift of Dhamma is the highest. The giving of alms is an act of charity toward those less fortunate. In the Apostolic age, Christians were taught that giving alms was an expression of love which was first expressed by God to them in that Jesus sacrificed himself as an act of love for the salvation of believers.[14] The offertory is the traditional moment in Roman Catholic Mass, Anglican Eucharist, and Lutheran Divine Services when alms are collected. Some Protestant groups, such as Baptists or Methodists, also engage in alms, although it is more commonly referred to as ""tithes and offerings"" by the church. Some fellowships practice regular giving for special purposes called Love Offerings for the poor, destitute or victims of catastrophic loss such as home fires or medical expenses. Traditionally, Deacons and Deaconesses are responsible for distributing these gifts among widows, orphans, and others in need. Many Christians support a plethora of charitable organizations not all of which claim a Christian religious affiliation. Many American Educational and Medical Institutions were founded by Christian fellowships giving alms.
 In the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches, the collection of alms and tithes has not been formally united to the offertory in any liturgical action. However, either having a collection plate in the narthex or passing it unobtrusively during the service is not uncommon. In Eastern Orthodox theology, almsgiving is an important part of the spiritual life, and fasting should always be accompanied by increased prayer and almsgiving.[15] Almsgiving in the name of the deceased also frequently accompanies prayer for the dead. Those whose financial circumstances do not permit the giving of monetary alms may give alms in other ways, such as intercessory prayer and acts of mercy.
 In the majority of Christian forms of worship and denominations, a collection of ""tithes and offerings"" is given for the support of the church's mission, budget, ministry, and for its relief of the poor, as an important act of Christian charity, united to communal prayer.
In some churches the ""offering plate"" or ""offering basket"" is placed upon the altar, as a sign that the offering is made to God, and a sign of the bond of Christian love.[note 4] In addition, private acts of charity, considered virtuous only if not done for others to admire, are seen as a Christian duty.
 Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' in front of others, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. The outward and an inward giving of alms:
Here Jesus places the primary focus on the motives behind such acts, which should be love.
 Rather, give as alms what is inside, and then everything will be clean for you! Giving of the rich versus the poor:
Here Jesus contrasts the giving of the rich and the poor
 He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury. And He saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins. And He said, 'Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them; for they all out of their surplus put into the offering; but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on.' Giving out of Love and not out of duty:
 He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' Dāna (Sanskrit: दान) is an ancient concept of alms-giving dating to the Vedic period of Hinduism.[16] The word for alms in Vedic literature is Bhiksha (भिक्षा).[17][18] The Rigveda has the earliest discussion of dāna in the Vedas and offers reasons for the virtue of alms-giving.[19]
 The Gods have not ordained hunger to be our death: even to the well-fed man comes death in varied shape,
The riches of the liberal never waste away, while he who will not give finds none to comfort him,
The man with food in store who, when the needy comes in miserable case begging for bread to eat,
Hardens his heart against him, when of old finds not one to comfort him.

Bounteous is he who gives unto the beggar who comes to him in want of food, and the feeble,
Success attends him in the shout of battle. He makes a friend of him in future troubles,
No friend is he who to his friend and comrade who comes imploring food, will offer nothing.

Let the rich satisfy the poor implorer, and bend his eye upon a longer pathway,
Riches come now to one, now to another, and like the wheels of cars are ever rolling,
The foolish man wins food with fruitless labour: that food – I speak the truth – shall be his ruin,
He feeds no trusty friend, no man to love him. All guilt is he who eats with no partaker.
 The early Upanishads, those composed before 500 BCE, also discuss the virtue of alms-giving. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, in verse 5.2.3 for example, states that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (damah), compassion or love for all sentient life (daya), and charity (dāna).[21][22][23] Chandogya Upanishad, Book III, similarly, states that a virtuous life requires: tapas (meditation, asceticism), dāna (charity), arjava (straightforwardness, non-hypocrisy), ahimsa (non-violence, non-injury to all sentiment beings) and satyavacana (truthfulness).[24][25][26]
 Bhagavad Gita describes the right and wrong forms of dāna in verses 17.20 through 17.22.[27] The Adi Parva of the Hindu Epic Mahabharata, in Chapter 91, states that a person must first acquire wealth by honest means, then embark on charity; be hospitable to those who come to him; never inflict pain on any living being; and share a portion with others whatever he consumes.[28] In the Vana Parva, Chapter 194, the Mahabharata recommends that one must, ""conquer the mean by charity, the untruthful by truth, the wicked by forgiveness, and dishonesty by honesty"".[29] The Bhagavata Purana discusses when dāna is proper and when it is improper. In Book 8, Chapter 19, verse 36 it states that charity is inappropriate if it endangers and cripples modest livelihood of one's biological dependents or of one’s own. Charity from surplus income above that required for modest living is recommended in the Puranas.[30]
 Dāna has been defined in traditional texts as any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return.[31] While dāna is typically given to one person or family, Hinduism also discusses charity or giving aimed at public benefit, sometimes called utsarga. This aims at larger projects such as building a rest house, school, drinking water or irrigation well, planting trees, and building care facility among others.[32]
 Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī, the 11th century Persian historian, who visited and lived in India for 16 years from about 1017 CE, mentions the practice of charity and almsgiving among Hindus as he observed during his stay. He wrote, ""It is obligatory with them (Hindus) every day to give alms as much as possible.""[33]
 After the taxes, there are different opinions on how to spend their income. Some destine one-ninth of it for alms.[34] Others divide this income (after taxes) into four portions. One fourth is destined for common expenses, the second for liberal works of a noble mind, the third for alms, and the fourth for being kept in reserve. Alms-giving is held as a noble deed in Hinduism, to be done without expectation of any return from those who receive the charity.[31] Some texts reason, referring to the nature of social life, that charity is a form of good karma that affects one's future circumstances and environment, and that good charitable deeds leads to good future life because of the reciprocity principle.[31] Other Hindu texts, such as Vyasa Samhita, state that reciprocity may be innate in human nature and social functions but dāna is a virtue in itself, as doing good lifts the nature of one who gives.[35] The texts do not recommend charity to unworthy recipients or where charity may harm or encourage injury to or by the recipient. Dāna, thus, is a dharmic act, requires idealistic-normative approach, and has spiritual and philosophical context.[31] Some medieval era authors state that dāna is best done with shraddha (faith), which is defined as being in good will, cheerful, welcoming the recipient of the charity and giving without anasuya (finding faults in the recipient).[36] These scholars of Hinduism, states Kohler, suggest that charity is most effective when it is done with delight, a sense of ""unquestioning hospitality"", where the dāna ignores the short term weaknesses as well as the circumstances of the recipient and takes a long term view.[36]
 Satrams, also called Dharamsala or Chathrams in parts of India, have been one means of alms-giving in Hinduism. Satrams are shelters (rest house) for travelers and the poor, with many serving water and free food. These were usually established along the roads connecting major Hindu temple sites in south Asia, as well as near major temples.[37][38][39]
 Hindu temples have served as institutions for alms-giving.[40][41] The dāna the temples received from Hindus were used to feed people in distress as well as fund public projects such as irrigation and land reclamation.[41][42] Other forms of alms-giving in Hinduism includes donating means of economic activity and food source. For example, Go Dāna (donation of a cow),[43] Bhu Dāna (भू दान) (donation of land), and Vidya Dāna or Jňana Dāna (विद्या दान, ज्ञान दान): gift of knowledge and skills, Aushadhā Dāna: Charity of care for the sick and diseased, Abhay Dāna: Giving freedom from fear (asylum, protection to someone facing imminent injury), and Anna Dāna (अन्ना दान): Giving food to the poor, needy and all visitors.[44] Between giving food and giving knowledge, Hindu texts suggest the gift of knowledge is superior.[45][46]
 A gift of Dhamma conquers all gifts;
the taste of Dhamma, all tastes;
a delight in Dhamma, all delights;
the ending of craving, all suffering
& stress."
Altruism	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism	"Altruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for happiness of other human beings and/or animals, resulting in a quality of life both material and spiritual. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of ""others"" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. In an extreme case, altruism may become a synonym of selflessness which is the opposite of selfishness.
 The word ""altruism"" was coined by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French, as altruisme, for an antonym of egoism.[1][2] He derived it from the Italian altrui, which in turn was derived from Latin alteri, meaning ""other people"" or ""somebody else"".[3]
 Altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another third-party individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action. Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is ""intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards"".[4] In one sense, the opposite of altruism is spite; a spiteful action harms another with no self-benefit.
 Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty, in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider relationships. Much debate exists as to whether ""true"" altruism is possible in human psychology. The theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification. The validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as ""benefits"".
 The term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with egoism, which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first. Effective altruism is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.
 The concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science, Auguste Comte, and has become a major topic for psychologists (especially evolutionary psychology researchers), evolutionary biologists, and ethologists. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.
 Marcel Mauss's book The Gift contains a passage called ""Note on alms"". This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:
 Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand, and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children. In the science of ethology (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of social evolution, altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.[5] In evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, tipping, courtship gifts, production of public goods, and environmentalism.[6]
 Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies.
 Some of the proposed mechanisms are:
 Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts. Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.[6]
 Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment. This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.[6]
 The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.[6]
 The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind George R. Price's development of the Price equation, which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds, such as Dictyostelium mucoroides. These protists live as individual amoebae until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.
 Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.[17]
 Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist Peter Kropotkin in his 1902 book Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution and Peter Singer in his book A Darwinian Left.
 Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the National Institutes of Health and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In their research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in October 2006,[18] they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.[19] One brain region, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex/basal forebrain, contributes to learning altruistic behavior, especially in those with trait empathy.[20] The same study has shown a connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding.[21]
 In fact, in an experiment published in March 2007 at the University of Southern California neuroscientist Antonio R. Damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that when confronted with moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with ""end-justifies-the-means"" answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue — in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city — these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains. According to Adrian Raine, a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study's implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: ""Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse. Without that awareness, people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets. Does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability?""[19]
 In another study, in the 1990s, Dr. Bill Harbaugh, a University of Oregon economist, concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fMRI scanner test in 2007 with his psychologist colleague Dr. Ulrich Mayr, reached the same conclusions of Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman about giving to charity, although they were able to divide the study group into two groups: ""egoists"" and ""altruists"". One of their discoveries was that, though rarely, even some of the considered ""egoists"" sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others, leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity, such as a person's environment and values.[21]
 The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines psychological altruism as ""a motivational state with the goal of increasing another’s welfare."" Psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism, which refers to the motivation to increase one's own welfare.[22]
 There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism.[23] Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors.[24] However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question. The social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self.[25] Daniel Batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory. He identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle (principlism). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless.[26] The empathy-altruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering. Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions. People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering.[22] Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.[27]
 In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service.[24] Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the Bystander effect). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility.[22][28] However, a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders.[22]
 Many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being.[29][30] In a study of older adults, those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live, and lower in depression, anxiety, and somatization.[31] Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health, but physical health and longevity as well, attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages.[29][32][33][34] One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one.[35] A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying. After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality.[36] Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being. A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness.[37] It is important to note that, while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness, it has also been found to work in the opposite direction—that happier people are also kinder. The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional. Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states.[38]
 Studies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness.[34] For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant).[39] Additionally, while generous acts make people feel good about themselves, it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others. Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being. A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that ""a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being."".[40]
 ""Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society"" (""Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity"". American Sociological Association.[41]). The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field. The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges public sociology saying, ""The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable"" (""Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity"" ASA). This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies. How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and ""build the good society"". The motivation of altruism is also the focus of study; some publications link the occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims.[42]
 Pathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme, and either harms the altruistic person, or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good.
 The term ""pathological altruism"" was popularised by the book Pathological Altruism.
 Examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs, hoarding of animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid.[43]
 Most, if not all, of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value. Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, and Sikhism, etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.
 Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism. Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. ""Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being"" (Dalai Lama).[44]
 Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: ""The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes"" (Dalai Lama[44]).
 In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.
 The fundamental principles of Jainism revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of Ahimsa – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first Tirthankara, Rishabhdev, introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.
 Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment.
 Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:
 The ""great vows"" (Mahavrata) are prescribed for monks and ""limited vows"" (Anuvrata) are prescribed for householders. The house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows. The monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.
 The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become Siddha (God in Jainism). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.
 Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the Gospel, especially in the Sermon on the Mount and the Sermon on the Plain. From biblical to medieval Christian traditions, tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of ""disinterested love"", as in the Pauline phrase ""love seeks not its own interests."" In his book Indoctrination and Self-deception, Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.
 St Thomas Aquinas interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself'[45] as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.[46] Considering that ""the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship"" and quotes Aristotle that ""the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves,""[47] he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.
 Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God. Thomas Jay Oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.
 German philosopher Max Scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, ""motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence"".[48] Another way is merely ""one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business.""[49] At its worst, Scheler says, ""love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse.""[50]
 In Islam, the concept 'ithaar' (إيثار) (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by ALLAH on the human body, considered to be property of ALLAH alone. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; Islam considers those practicing Eyaar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.[51]
This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence. A constant concern for ALLAH (i.e. God) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.[52]
This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like Rabia al-Adawiyya who paid attention to the difference between dedication to ALLAH (i.e. God) and dedication to people. Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet Yunus Emre explained this philosophy as ""Yaratılanı severiz, Yaratandan ötürü"" or We love the creature, because of The Creator. For many Muslims, i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays. However, i'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times.
 Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.[53] This is defined as bestowal, or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God. Kabbalah defines God as the force of giving in existence. Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.[54]
 Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.[55] Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity.[56]
 Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness. The concept of ""seva,"" or selfless service to the community for its own sake is an important concept in Sikhism.[57]
 The fifth Nanak, Guru Arjun Dev, sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the Guru Granth. The ninth Guru, Tegh Bahadur, sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. In the late seventeenth century, Guru Gobind Singh Ji (the tenth guru in Sikhism), was in war with the Mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh, Bhai Kanhaiya, attended the troops of the enemy.[58] He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield.""What were you doing, and why?"" asked the Guru. ""I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them,"" replied Bhai Kanhaiya. The Guru responded, ""Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru.""
 It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.[59]
 In Hinduism Selflessness (Atmatyag), Love (Prema), Kindness (Daya) and Forgiveness (Kshama) are considered as the highest acts of humanity or ""Manushyattva"". Giving alms to the beggers or poor people is considered as a divine act or ""Punya"" and Hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or ""Paapa"" and will led them to heaven or ""Swarga"" in afterlife. Altruism is also the central act of various Hindu mythology and religious poems and songs.
 Swami Vivekananda, the legendary Hindu monk, has said -""Jive prem kare jeijon, Seijon sebiche Iswar"" (Whoever loves any living being, is serving god.). Mass donation of clothes to poor people (Vastraseva), or blood donation camp or mass food donation (Annaseva) for poor people is common in various Hindu religious ceremonies.
 Swami Sivananda, an Advaita scholar, reiterates the views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras, a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya, which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.
 However the very well known and popular text, the Bhagavad Gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga (achieving oneness with God through action) & ""nishkaama karma"" or action without expectation / desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism. Altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in Hindu literature and is central to Hindu morality.[60]
 There exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is ethical egoism, which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism, which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.
 A related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism, the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. Rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).
 Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.[61] Effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact, based upon their values.[62] It is the broad, evidence-based and cause-neutral approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity.[63] Effective altruism is part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices.
 While a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector, the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects, companies, and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives, help people, or otherwise have the biggest benefit.[64] People associated with the movement include philosopher Peter Singer,[65] Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz,[66] Cari Tuna,[67] Ben Delo,[68] Oxford-based researchers William MacAskill[69] and Toby Ord,[70] professional poker player Liv Boeree,[71][72] and writer Jacy Reese.[73]
 The genes OXTR, CD38, COMT, DRD4, DRD5, IGF2, GABRB2 have been found to be candidate genes for altruism.[74]"
Donation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation	"A donation is a gift for charity, humanitarian aid, or to benefit a cause. A donation may take various forms, including money, alms, services, or goods such as clothing, toys, food, or vehicles. A donation may satisfy medical needs such as blood or organs for transplant.
 Charitable donations of goods or services are also called gifts in kind.
 In the United States, in 2007, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that American households in the lowest fifth in terms of wealth, gave on average a higher percentage of their incomes to charitable organizations than those households in the highest fifth.[1] Charity Navigator writes that, according to Giving USA, Americans gave $298 billion in 2011 (about 2% of GDP).[2] The majority of donations were from individuals (73%), then from bequests (about 12%), foundations (2%) and less than 1% from corporations. The largest sector to receive donations was religious organizations (32%), then education (13%). Giving has increased in 3 out of 4 years since 1971 (with the occasional declines occurring around recession years).[2]
 Blackbaud reports that, in the US, online giving in 2012 grew 11% on a year-over-year basis. The percentage of total fundraising that comes from online giving was about 7% in 2012. This was an increase from 6% in 2011 and is nearing the record level of 8% from 2010 when online giving spiked in response to Haitian earthquake relief efforts. Steve MacLaughlin notes in the report that ""the Internet has now become the first-response channel of choice for donors during disasters and other emergency events."" [3]
 Blackbaud's 2015 Charitable Giving report revealed a 9% increase in online giving compared to 2014. In addition, online giving represented 7% of overall fundraising, with 14% of online donations made on mobile devices. Donations made on the international online giving day #GivingTuesday were up 52% from the previous year.[4]
 Donations are given without return consideration. This lack of return consideration means that, in common law, an agreement to make a donation is an ""imperfect contract void for want of consideration.""[5]  Only when the donation is actually made does it acquire legal status as a transfer or property.[6]
 In politics, the law of some countries may prohibit or restrict the extent to which politicians may accept gifts or donations of large sums of money, especially from business or lobby groups (see campaign finance). Donations of money or property to qualifying charitable organizations are also usually tax deductible. Because this reduces the state's tax income, calls have been raised that the state (and the public in general) should pay more attention towards ensuring that charities actually use this 'tax money' in suitable ways.
 There have been discussions on whether also a donation of time should be tax deductible.[7]
 The person or institution giving a gift is called the donor, and the person or institution getting the gift is called the donee.[6]
 It is possible to donate in the name of a third party, making a gift in honor or in memory of someone or something. Gifts in honor or memory of a third party are made for various reasons, such as holiday gifts, wedding gifts, in memory of somebody who has died, in memory of pets or in the name of groups or associations no longer existing. Memorial gifts are sometimes requested by their survivors (e.g. ""in lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to ABC Charity""), usually directing donations to a charitable organization for which the deceased was a donor or volunteer, or for a cause befitting the deceased's priorities in life or manner of death.  Memorial donations are also sometimes given by people if they are unable to attend the ceremony."
Fundraising	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundraising	"Fundraising or fund-raising (also known as ""development"" or ""advancement"") is the process of seeking and gathering voluntary financial contributions by engaging individuals, businesses, charitable foundations, or governmental agencies. Although fundraising typically refers to efforts to gather money for non-profit organizations, it is sometimes used to refer to the identification and solicitation of investors or other sources of capital for for-profit enterprises.
 Traditionally, fundraising consisted mostly of asking for donations on the street or at people's doors, and this is experiencing very strong growth[1] in the form of face-to-face fundraising, but new forms of fundraising, such as online fundraising, have emerged in recent years, though these are often based on older methods such as grassroots fundraising.
 Fundraising is a significant way that non-profit organizations may obtain the money for their operations. These operations can involve a very broad array of concerns such as religious or philanthropic groups such as research organizations, public broadcasters, political campaigns and environmental issues.
 Some examples of charitable organizations include student scholarship merit awards for athletic or academic achievement, humanitarian and ecological concerns, disaster relief, human rights, research, and other social issues.
 Some of the most substantial fundraising efforts in the United States are conducted by colleges and universities. Commonly the fundraising, or ""development"" / ""advancement,"" program, makes a distinction between annual fund appeals and major campaigns. Most institutions use professional development officers to conduct superior fundraising appeals for both the entire institution or individual colleges and departments (e.g. School of Art, School of Math, School of Science, etc... as well as campus institutions like athletics[2] and libraries.[3]).  The number of people involved will vary widely depending on the size of the institution.
 Equally important are fundraising efforts by virtually all recognized religious groups throughout the world. These efforts are organized on a local, national, and global level. Sometimes, such funds will go exclusively toward assisting the basic needs of others, while money may at other times be used only for evangelism or proselytism. Usually, religious organizations mix the two, which can sometimes cause tension.
 Fundraising also plays a major role in political campaigns.  This fact, despite numerous campaign finance reform laws, continues to be a highly controversial topic in American politics. Political action committees (PACs) are the best-known organizations that back candidates and political parties, though others such as 527 groups also have an impact. Some advocacy organizations conduct fundraising for-or-against policy issues in an attempt to influence legislation.
 While public broadcasters are completely government-funded in much of the world, there are many countries where some funds must come from donations from the public. In the United States less than 15% of local public broadcasting stations' funding comes from the federal government. Pledge drives, a type of annual giving, commonly occur about three times each year, usually lasting one to two weeks each time. Viewership and listenership often decline significantly during funding periods, so special programming may be aired in order to keep regular viewers and listeners interested.
 Fundraising is just one of several revenue sources for a nonprofit organization. Fundraising revenue can come in the form of grants from government agencies, non-profit foundations or corporations; donations from individuals; and sales and services. Income from endowment is not strictly fundraising but rather the fruits of the investment of previous fundraising.
 Non-profit organizations also raise funds through competing for grant funding. Grants are offered by governmental units and private foundations/charitable trusts to non-profit organizations for the benefit of all parties to the transaction. Charitable giving by foundations in the U.S was estimated to be $66.90 billion in 2017.[4]
 Charitable giving by corporations in the U.S was estimated to be $20.77 billion in 2017.[5] This consists of corporate grants as well as matching gift and volunteer grants. 65% of Fortune 500 companies offer employee matching gift programs and 40% offer volunteer grant programs.[6] These are charitable giving programs set up by corporations in which the company matches donations made by employees to eligible nonprofit organizations or provides grants to eligible nonprofit organizations as a way to recognize and promote employee volunteerism.
 The donor base (often called a file or simply ""constituents"") for higher education includes alumni, parents, friends, private foundations, and corporations. Gifts of appreciated property are important components of such efforts because the tax advantage they confer on the donor encourages larger gifts. The process of soliciting appreciated assets is called planned giving. Charitable giving by individuals in the U.S. was estimated to be $286.65 billion in 2017.[7]
 The classic development program at institutions of higher learning include prospect identification, prospect research and verification of the prospect's viability, cultivation, solicitation, and finally stewardship, the latter being the process of keeping donors informed about how past support has been used. When goods or professional services are donated to an organization rather than cash, this is called an in-kind gift.
 A number of charities and non-profit organizations are increasingly using the internet as a means to raise funds; this practice is referred to as online fundraising. For example, the NSPCC operates a search engine which generates funds via Pay per click links, and Better The World operates tools allowing funds to be raised via members viewing ethical ads on a browser sidebar and/or blog widget.[8] Save the Children's Dave Hartman wrote after the $1 Million Operation Sharecraft online campaign, ""We may have reached our mark, but this is just the beginning of a new era of fundraising and using social media and digital technology to better the world.""[9]
 In recent years, crowdfunding has begun to be used as a method to engage small-donation donors for small, specific opportunities.
 While fundraising often involves the donation of money as an outright gift, money may also be generated by selling a product of some kind, also known as product fundraising. Girl Scouts of the USA are well known for selling cookies in order to generate funds. It is also common to see on-line impulse sales links to be accompanied by statements that a proportion of proceeds will be directed to a particular charitable foundation.  Tax law may require differentiating between the cost of an item versus its gift value, such as a $100.00 per person dinner, for a $25.00 cost meal.  Fundraising often involves recognition to the donor, such as naming rights or adding donors to an honor roll or other general recognition.  Charity Ad Books are another form of donation for recognition, sponsorship or selling of ads often in an event related program or group directory.
 Organizations raise funds to support capital projects, endowments, or operating expenses of current programs.
 Capital fundraising is when fundraising is conducted to raise major sums for a building or endowment, and generally keep such funds separate from operating funds. This is often done over a period of time (in a capital campaign) to encourage donors to give more than they would normally give and tap donors, especially corporations and foundations who would not otherwise give. A capital campaign normally begins with a private phase before launching a public appeal.
 Many non-profit organizations solicit funds for a financial endowment, which is a sum of money that is invested to generate an annual return. Although endowments may be created when a sizable gift is received from an individual or family, often as directed in a will upon the death of a family member, they more typically are the result of many gifts over time from a variety of sources.
 A fundraising event (also called a fundraiser) is an event or campaign whose primary purpose is to raise money for a cause, charity or non-profit organization. Fundraisers often benefit charitable, non-profit, religious, or non-governmental organizations, though there are also fundraisers that benefit for-profit companies and individuals.
 Special events are another method of raising funds. These range from formal dinners to benefit concerts to walkathons. Events are used to increase visibility and support for an organization as well as raising funds.[10]  Events can feature activities for the group such as speakers, a dance, an outing or entertainment, to encourage group participation and giving.  Events can also include fundraising methods such as a raffle or charity auction.  Events often feature notable sponsors or honoree.  Events often feature a charity ""ad book"" as a program guide for the event, but more importantly, as another fundraiser providing members, supporters and vendors to show their support of and to the group at the event by way of placing an ad-like page, 1/2 page, 1/4 page, stating or showing support.  Events and their associated fundraisers can be a major source of a group's revenue, visibility and donor relations.
 One specific type of event is the ""ad book"" fundraiser, where those who wish to give funds to a fundraising group do so through the sponsorship or statement within a book of advertisements.
 Online fundraising pages have become very popular for people taking part in activities such as a charity. Those pages facilitate online payments in support of the charity.
 Popular charity fundraisers in major American cities include lavish black-tie gala benefit dinners that honor celebrities, philanthropists, and business leaders who help to fundraise for the event's goals through solicitations of their social and business connections.[11]
 Often called donor cultivation, relationship building is the foundation on which most fundraising takes place.[12] Most fundraising development strategies divide donors into a series of categories based on the amount and frequency of donations. For instance, annual giving and recurring gifts represent the base of a fundraising pyramid. This would be followed by mid-level gifts, planned gifts, major gifts, and principal gifts.
 More sophisticated strategies use tools to overlay demographic and other market segmentation data against their database of donors in order to more precisely customize communication and more effectively target resources.[13] Research by Peter Maple in the UK[14] shows that charities generally underinvest in good marketing research spending around a quarter of what an equivalent sized for profit company might spend.
 Donor relations and stewardship[15] professionals support fundraisers by recognizing and thanking donors, and demonstrating the impact of their donations in a fashion that will cultivate future giving to nonprofit organizations.
 Recent research by Adrian Sargeant and the Association of Fundraising Professionals' Fundraising Effectiveness Project suggests the sector has a long way to go in improving the quality of donor relations. The sector generally loses 50–60% of its newly acquired donors between their first and second donations and one in three, year on year thereafter. The economics of regular or sustained giving are rather different, but even then organizations routinely lose 30% of their donors from one year to the next.[16]
 A capital campaign is ""an intensive fundraising effort designed to raise a specified sum of money within a defined time period to meet the varied asset-building needs of an organization"". Asset-building activities include the construction, renovation or expansion of facilities (for example, a new building), the acquisition or improvement of land, equipment, or other items, and additions to a financial endowment. Two characteristics set capital campaigns apart from other forms of fund-raising activities. First, ""the gifts solicited are much larger than those generally sought during an annual fund"". Second, ""pledges are emphasized as commitments payable over a number of years convenient to the donor or through the transfer of appreciated real or personal property"".[17]
 Various types of capital campaigns have been identified. The traditional ""brick and mortar"" campaign, focused on building construction or improvements, was considered a ""once in a lifetime"" campaign in the past because of the ambitious goals of the campaign. Today, however, organizations frequently schedule capital campaigns every five to ten years, and ""the megagoals announced by large institutions often are the result of 'counting everything' during a five-to seven-year campaign period"".[17]
 A second type of campaign is the comprehensive, integrated, or total development campaign, which aims for a longer fund-raising program based on a long-term analysis of the organization's needs and direction. This form of campaign can wrap together capital projects, endowment and operating expenses as its purpose, and use a variety of fund-raising activities, such as annual gift drives, which are ""slower-paced and lack the intensity of the traditional capital campaign"".[17]
 Some non-profit organizations demonstrate greater accountability by showing donors the direct impact of their fundraising efforts. This accountability usually comes in the form of a vote, where the members select a specific program or charity that they would like their money to go to. A specific example of accountable fundraising is the organization Better The World which allows members to select the charity which receives the money they have raised; members can constantly keep track of the amount raised on the browser sidebar tool.[18]
 Many non-profit organizations take advantage of the services of professional fundraisers. These fundraisers may be paid for their services either through fees unrelated to the amounts of money to be raised, or by retaining a percentage of raised funds (percentage-based compensation). The latter approach is expressly forbidden under the Code of Ethics of the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), a professional membership body.[19]
However, by far the most common practice of American non-profits is to employ a staff person whose main responsibility is fund raising.  This person is paid a salary like any other employee, and is usually a part of the top management staff of the organization.
 Some non-profit organizations nonetheless engage fundraisers who are paid a percentage of the funds they raise. In the United States, this ratio of funds retained to funds passed on to the non-profit is subject to reporting to a number of state's Attorneys General or Secretaries of state.[20]  This ratio is highly variable and subject to change over time and place, and it is a point of contention between a segment of the general public and the non-profit organizations.
 The term ""professional fundraiser"" is in many cases a legislated term referring to third-party firms whose services are contracted for, whereas ""fundraising professionals"" or development officers are often individuals or staff at charitable non-profits.  Although potentially confusing, the distinction is an important one to note.
 A specialty within the fundraising profession is the ""grant professional."" Grant professionals with at least three years experience, and other requirements, can become certified as Grant Professional Certified (GPC). The GPC credential is administered by Grant Professionals Certification Institute, whose mission is to strengthen the nonprofit sector's ability to pursue and maintain public sector and private sector funding by promoting competency and ethical practices within the field of grantsmanship. The certification process is designed to measure minimum knowledge and skills related to all aspects of grant development and management, including but not limited to such areas as grant research or pre-production, grant construction, grant reporting, public sector funding, private sector funding, ethics and grant accountability.[21]
 Online and mobile fundraising had become a popular fundraising method over the last few years due to its accessibility. Fundraising organizations are using mobile and online fundraising providers to attract donors around the globe. Common online and mobile fundraising methods include online donation pages, text to give, mobile silent auctions, and peer to peer fundraising. 
 Since 2016, online giving has grown by 17% in the United States. In 2018, digital fundraising accounted for 8.5% percent of charitable donations and 24% of online donations were made on a mobile device in the United States.[22].
 Organizations in the United States established for charitable purposes are allowed to raise funds from many sources. They are given a specific designation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), commonly noted as 501(c)(3) organizations. Other nonprofits such as fraternal associations have different IRS designations, and may or may not be eligible to raise funds. Financial information on many nonprofits, including all nonprofits that file annual IRS 990 forms is available from GuideStar.
  The dictionary definition of fundraising at Wiktionary"
Philanthropy	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy	"Philanthropy means the love of humanity. A conventional modern definition is ""private initiatives, for the public good, focusing on quality of life"", which combines an original humanistic tradition with a social scientific aspect developed in the 20th century. The definition also serves to contrast philanthropy with business endeavors, which are private initiatives for private good, e.g., focusing on material gain, and with government endeavors, which are public initiatives for public good, e.g., focusing on provision of public services.[1] A person who practices philanthropy is called a philanthropist.
 Philanthropy has distinguishing characteristics separate from charity; not all charity is philanthropy, or vice versa, though there is a recognized degree of overlap in practice. A difference commonly cited is that charity aims to relieve the pain of a particular social problem, whereas philanthropy attempts to address the root cause of the problem—the difference between the proverbial gift of a fish to a hungry person, versus teaching them how to fish.[2][3][4][5]
 In the second century AD, Plutarch used the Greek concept of philanthrôpía to describe superior human beings. During the Roman Catholic Middle Ages, philanthrôpía was superseded by Caritas charity, selfless love, valued for salvation and escape from purgatory. Philanthropy was modernized by Sir Francis Bacon in the 1600s, who is largely credited with preventing the word from being owned by horticulture. Bacon considered philanthrôpía to be synonymous with ""goodness"",  correlated with the Aristotelian conception of virtue, as consciously instilled habits of good behaviour.   Samuel Johnson simply defined philanthropy as ""love of mankind; good nature"".[6] This definition still survives today and is often cited more gender-neutrally as the ""love of humanity.""[7]
 In London prior to the 18th century, parochial and civic charities were typically established by bequests and operated by local church parishes (such as St Dionis Backchurch) or guilds (such as the Carpenters' Company). During the 18th century, however, ""a more activist and explicitly Protestant tradition of direct charitable engagement during life"" took hold, exemplified by the creation of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge and Societies for the Reformation of Manners.[8]
 In 1739,  Thomas Coram, appalled by the number of abandoned children living on the streets of London, received a royal charter to establish the Foundling Hospital to look after these unwanted orphans in Lamb's Conduit Fields, Bloomsbury.[9] This was ""the first children's charity in the country, and one that 'set the pattern for incorporated associational charities' in general.""[9] The hospital ""marked the first great milestone in the creation of these new-style charities.""[8]
 Jonas Hanway, another notable philanthropist of the era, established The Marine Society in 1756 as the first seafarer's charity, in a bid to aid the recruitment of men to the navy.[10] By 1763, the society had recruited over 10,000 men and it was incorporated in 1772. Hanway was also instrumental in establishing the Magdalen Hospital to rehabilitate prostitutes. These organizations were funded by subscription and run as voluntary associations. They raised public awareness of their activities through the emerging popular press and were generally held in high social regard—some charities received state recognition in the form of the Royal Charter.
 Philanthropists, such as anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce, began to adopt active campaigning roles, where they would champion a cause and lobby the government for legislative change. This included organized campaigns against the ill treatment of animals and children and the campaign that succeeded in ending the slave trade throughout the Empire starting in 1807.[11]  Although there were no slaves allowed in Britain itself, many rich men owned sugar plantations in the West Indies, and resisted the movement to buy them out until it finally succeeded in 1833.[12]
 Financial donations to organized charities became fashionable among the middle-class in the 19th century.  By 1869 there were over 200 London charities with an annual income, all together, of about £2 million. By 1885, rapid growth had produced over 1000 London charities, with an income of about £4.5 million.  They included a wide range of religious and secular goals, with the American import, the YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association) as one of the largest, and many small ones such as the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain Association.  In addition to making annual donations, increasingly wealthy industrialists and financiers left generous sums in their wills.  A sample of 466 wills in the 1890s revealed a total wealth of £76 million, of which £20 million was bequeathed to charities.  By 1900 London charities enjoyed an annual income of about £8.5 million.[13]
 Led by the energetic Lord Shaftesbury (1801–1885), philanthropists organized themselves.[14] In 1869 they set up the Charity Organisation Society. It was a federation of district committees, one in each of the 42 Poor Law divisions.  Its central office had experts in coordination and guidance, thereby maximizing the impact of charitable giving to the poor.[15]  Many of the charities were designed to alleviate the harsh living conditions in the slums. such as the Labourer's Friend Society founded in 1830.  This included the promotion of allotment of land to labourers for ""cottage husbandry"" that later became the allotment movement, and in 1844 it became the first Model Dwellings Company—an organization that sought to improve the housing conditions of the working classes by building new homes for them, while at the same time receiving a competitive rate of return on any investment. This was one of the first housing associations, a philanthropic endeavor that flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century, brought about by the growth of the middle class. Later associations included the Peabody Trust, and the Guinness Trust. The principle of philanthropic intention with capitalist return was given the label ""five per cent philanthropy.""[16][17]
 In 1863, the Swiss businessman Henry Dunant used his personal fortune to fund the Geneva Society for Public Welfare, which became the International Committee of the Red Cross.  During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Dunant personally led Red Cross delegations that treated soldiers. He shared the first Nobel Peace Prize for this work in 1901.[18][19]
 The French Red Cross played a minor role in the war with Germany (1870–71). After that it became a major factor in shaping French civil society as a non-religious humanitarian organization.  It was closely tied to the army's Service de Santé.  By 1914 it operated  one thousand local committees with 164,000 members, 21,500 trained nurses, and over 27 million francs in assets.[20]
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) played a major role in working with POW's on all sides in World War II.  It was in a cash starved position when the war began in 1939, but quickly mobilized its national offices set up a Central Prisoner of War Agency. For example, it provided food, mail and assistance to 365,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers and civilians held captive.  Suspicions, especially by London, of ICRC as too tolerant or even complicit with Nazi Germany led to its side-lining in favour of the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) as the primary humanitarian agency after 1945.[21]
 In France,  the Pasteur Institute had a monopoly of specialized microbiological knowledge allowed it to raise money for serum production from both private and public sources, walking the line between a commercial pharmaceutical venture and a philanthropic enterprise.[22]
 By 1933, at the depth of the Great Depression, the French wanted a welfare state to relieve distress, but did not want new taxes. War veterans came up with a solution: the new national lottery proved highly popular to gamblers, while generating  the cash needed without raising taxes.[23]
 American money proved invaluable.  The Rockefeller Foundation opened an office in Paris and helped design and fund France's modern public health system, under the National Institute of Hygiene.  It also set up schools to train physicians and nurses.[24][25]"
Volunteering	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering	"Volunteering is generally considered an altruistic activity where an individual or group provides services for no financial or social gain ""to benefit another person, group or organization"".[1] Volunteering is also renowned for skill development and is often intended to promote goodness or to improve human quality of life. Volunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served.[2] It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.
 In a military context a volunteer is someone who joins an armed force of their own volition rather than being conscripted, and is usually paid.
 The verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun volunteer, in C.1600, ""one who offers himself for military service,"" from the Middle French voluntaire.[3] In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word volunteering has more recent usage—still predominantly military—coinciding with the phrase community service.[3][4]
In a military context, a volunteer army is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work ""for free"" and are given regular pay.
 During this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities[citation needed]. In 1851, the first YMCA in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the ""Angel of the Battlefield"" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen.  Barton founded the American Red Cross in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief operations, including relief for victims of the Johnstown Flood in 1889.
 The Salvation Army is one of the oldest and largest organizations working for disadvantaged people. Though it is a charity organization, it has organized a number of volunteering programs since its inception.[5]
Prior to the 19th century, few formal charitable organizations existed to assist people in need.
 In the first few decades of the 20th century, several volunteer organizations were founded, including the Rotary International, Kiwanis International, Association of Junior Leagues International, and Lions Clubs International.
 The Great Depression saw one of the first large-scale, nationwide efforts to coordinate volunteering for a specific need. During World War II, thousands of volunteer offices supervised the volunteers who helped with the many needs of the military and the home front, including collecting supplies, entertaining soldiers on leave, and caring for the injured.[5]
 After World War II, people shifted the focus of their altruistic passions to other areas, including helping the poor and volunteering overseas. A major development was the Peace Corps in the United States in 1960. When President Lyndon B. Johnson declared a War on Poverty in 1964, volunteer opportunities started to expand and continued into the next few decades. The process for finding volunteer work became more formalized, with more volunteer centers forming and new ways to find work appearing on the World Wide Web.[5]
 According to the Corporation for National and Community Service (in 2012), about 64.5 million Americans, or 26.5 percent of the adult population, gave 7.9 billion hours of volunteer service worth $175 billion.  This calculates at about 125–150 hours per year or 3 hours per week at a rate of $22 per hour. Volunteer hours in the UK are similar; the data for other countries is unavailable.
 In 1960, after the so-called revolutionary war in Cuba ended, Ernesto Che Guevara created the concept of volunteering work. It was created with the intention that workers across the country volunteer a few hours of work on their work centers.
 Many schools on all education levels offer service-learning programs, which allow students to serve the community through volunteering while earning educational credit.[6] According to Alexander Astin in the foreword to Where's the Learning in Service-Learning? by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, Jr.,""...we promote more wide-spread adoption of service-learning in higher education because we see it as a powerful means of preparing students to become more caring and responsible parents and citizens and of helping colleges and universities to make good on their pledge to 'serve society.'""[7] When describing service learning, the Medical Education at Harvard says, ""Service learning unites academic study and volunteer community service in mutually reinforcing ways. ...service learning is characterized by a relationship of partnership: the student learns from the service agency and from the community and, in return, gives energy, intelligence, commitment, time and skills to address human and community needs.""[6] Volunteering in service learning seems to have the result of engaging both mind and heart, thus providing a more powerful learning experience; according to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, it succeeds by the fact that it ""...fosters student development by capturing student interest...""[7]:1–2,8 While not recognized by everyone as a legitimate approach, research on the efficacy of service learning has grown.[7]:xv-xvii Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles conducted a national study of American college students to ascertain the significance of service learning programs,[7]:xvi According to Eyler and Giles,""These surveys, conducted before and after a semester of community service, examine the impact of service-learning on students.""[7]:xvi They describe their experience with students involved in service-learning in this way: ""Students like service-learning. When we sit down with a group of students to discuss service-learning experiences, their enthusiasm is unmistakable. ...it is clear that [the students]believe that what they gain from service-learning differs qualitatively from what they often derive from more traditional instruction.""[7]:1–2
 Skills-based volunteering is leveraging the specialized skills and the talents of individuals to strengthen the infrastructure of nonprofits, helping them build and sustain their capacity to successfully achieve their missions.[8] This is in contrast to traditional volunteering, where specific training is not required.[citation needed]  The average hour of traditional volunteering is valued by the Independent Sector at between $24.69 an hour.[9] Skills-based volunteering is valued at $40–500 an hour, depending on the market value of the time.[10][failed verification]
 An increasingly popular form of volunteering among young people, particularly gap year students and graduates, is to travel to communities in the developing world to work on projects with local organisations. Activities include teaching English, working in orphanages, conservation, assisting non-governmental organizations and medical work. International volunteering often aims to give participants valuable skills and knowledge in addition to benefits to the host community and organization.[11]
 Also called e-volunteering or online volunteering, virtual volunteering is a volunteer who completes tasks, in whole or in part, offsite from the organization being assisted. They use the Internet and a home, school, telecenter or work computer, or other Internet-connected device, such as a PDA or smartphone. Virtual volunteering is also known as cyber service, telementoring, and teletutoring, as well as various other names. Virtual volunteering is similar to telecommuting, except that instead of online employees who are paid, these are online volunteers who are not paid.[12][13]
 Micro-volunteering is a task performed via an internet-connected device. An individual typically does this task in small, un-paid increments of time. Micro-volunteering is distinct from ""virtual volunteering"" in that it typically does not require the individual volunteer to go through an application process, screening process, or training period.[14][15]
 Environmental volunteering refers to the volunteers who contribute towards environmental management or conservation. Volunteers conduct a range of activities including environmental monitoring, ecological restoration such as re-vegetation and weed removal, protecting endangered animals, and educating others about the natural environment.[16]
 Volunteering often plays a pivotal role in the recovery effort following natural disasters, such as tsunamis, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and earthquakes. For example, the 1995 Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake in Japan was a watershed moment, bringing in many first-time volunteers for earthquake response. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami attracted a large number of volunteers worldwide, deployed by non-governmental organizations, government agencies, and the United Nations.[17][18]
 During the 2012 hurricane Sandy emergency, Occupy Sandy volunteers, formed a laterally organized rapid-response team that provided much needed help during and after the storm, from food to shelter to reconstruction.  It is an example of mutualism at work, pooling resources and assistance and leveraging social media.
 Resource poor schools around the world rely on government support or on efforts from volunteers and private donations, in order to run effectively. In some countries, whenever the economy is down, the need for volunteers and resources increases greatly.[19] There are many opportunities available in school systems for volunteers. Yet, there are not many requirements in order to volunteer in a school system. Whether one is a high school or TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) graduate or college student, most schools require just voluntary and selfless effort.[20]
 Much like the benefits of any type of volunteering there are great rewards for the volunteer, student, and school. In addition to intangible rewards, volunteers can add relevant experience to their resumes. Volunteers who travel to assist may learn foreign culture and language.
 Volunteering in schools can be an additional teaching guide for the students and help to fill the gap of local teachers. Cultural and language exchange during teaching and other school activities can be the most essential learning experience for both students and volunteers.[20]
 Benefacto, a volunteering brokerage, describe corporate volunteering as ""Companies giving their employees an allowance of paid time off annually, which they use to volunteer at a charity of their choice.""[21]
 A majority of the companies at the Fortune 500 allow their employees to volunteer during work hours. These formalized Employee Volunteering Programs (EVPs), also called Employer Supported Volunteering (ESV), are regarded as a part of the companies' sustainability efforts and their social responsibility activities.[22] About 40% of Fortune 500 companies provide monetary donations, also known as volunteer grants, to nonprofits as a way to recognize employees who dedicate significant amounts of time to volunteering in the community.[23]
 According to the information from VolunteerMatch, a service that provides Employee Volunteering Program solutions, the key drivers for companies that produce and manage EVPs are building brand awareness and affinity, strengthening trust and loyalty among consumers, enhancing corporate image and reputation, improving employee retention, increasing employee productivity and loyalty, and providing an effective vehicle to reach strategic goals.[24]
 In April 2015, David Cameron pledged to give all UK workers employed by companies with more 250 staff mandatory three days’ paid volunteering leave, which if implemented will generate an extra 360 million volunteering hours a year.[25]
 Community volunteering, in the US called ""community service"", refers globally to those who work to improve their local community. This activity commonly occurs through not for profit organizations, local governments and churches; but also encompasses ad-hoc or informal groups such as recreational sports teams.[26]
 There are many proven personal benefits of community volunteerism. Working together with a group of people who have different ethnicity, backgrounds, and views reduces stereotypes. Community volunteerism has also been proven to improve student's academic success.[citation needed]
 According to Where's the Learning in Service Learning? by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, immersing oneself into service learning and serving others has many positive effects both academic and personal. Not only does surrounding oneself with new people and learning how to work together as a group help one improve teamwork and relational skills, it reduces stereotypes, increases appreciation of other cultures, and works to allow young people to find others that they relate to.
 Eyler and Giles noted that at the beginning and end of a college semester that included three hours of community service a week, students reported a much higher regard for cultural differences. At the end of the semester those who had participated in service-learning were noted as saying that the most important things that they had learned were not to judge others, and to appreciate every type of person because everyone shares some similar key characteristics.
 Community volunteer work has proven to be a powerful predictor in students' academic lives and college experience as a whole. Studies have shown that students who participate in community service as a part of their college course of study have a much higher correlation of completing their degree (Astin, 1992;[27] Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991[28]). In addition, college students who participate in community volunteer projects as a part of their college experience report finding a much greater relevance in their academic studies after completing community volunteer projects.[29] According to University Health Services, studies have found that volunteering can positively impact a student's overall mental and emotional health.[30]
 In some European countries government organisations and non-government organisations provide auxiliary positions for a certain period in institutions like hospitals, schools, memorial sites and welfare institutions. The difference to other types of volunteering is that there are strict legal regulations, what organisation is allowed to engage volunteers and about the period a volunteer is allowed to work in a voluntary position. Due to that fact, the volunteer is getting a limited amount as a pocket money from the government. An organization having one of the biggest manpower in Europe is the German Federal volunteers service (Bundesfreiwilligendienst), that was founded in 2011, by having more than 35.000 federal volunteers in 2012.[31] A much older institution is the Voluntary social year (Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr) in Austria and Germany.[32][33]
 Sochi Olympics 25,000 volunteers worked at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. They supported the organisers in more than 20 functional areas: meeting guests, assisting navigation, organising the opening and closing ceremonies, organising food outlets, etc. Volunteer applications were open to any nationals of Russia and other countries. The Sochi 2014 Organising Committee received about 200,000 applications, 8 applicants per place. Volunteers received training over the course of more than a year at 26 volunteer centres in 17 cities across Russia. The majority of participants were between 17 and 22 years old. At the same time, 3000 applications were submitted from people over 55 years old. Some of them worked as volunteers during the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. It was the first experience with such a large-scale volunteer program in the contemporary Russia.
 For the first time in its history, Russia will host the FIFA World Cup from 14 June till 15 July 2018. Moreover, it will be the first time the World Cup games will be played both in Europe and Asia. The games will be hosted by 12 stadiums in 11 Russian cities.[34]
 The volunteer program of the 2018 FIFA World Cup has engaged thousands of people from Russia and other countries around the world.
 The program included several stages: recruitment, selection and training of volunteers, organisation of their work during the championship. The recruitment of volunteers for the FIFA Confederations Cup and the FIFA World Cup via FIFA.com started on 1 June 2016 and closed on 30 December 2016. Some of the volunteers worked at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup: 1733 people assisted the organisers in Saint Petersburg, 1590 worked in Moscow, 1261 in Sochi, 1260 in Kazan, a total of 5844 participants.
 The FIFA World Cup will be supported by 17,040 volunteers of the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee.
 Candidates living in Russia were selected by 15 volunteer centres in the host cities based in some of Russia's leading higher educational institutions: Synergy University, Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, Russian State Social University, Moscow Automobile and Road Construction University, Saint Petersburg State University of Economics, Samara State University, Volga Region State Academy of Physical Culture, Sport and Tourism, Don State Technical University, Ogarev Mordovia State University, Volgograd State University, State University of Nizhny Novgorod, Samara State Aerospace University, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, and Ural Federal University.
 Candidates from other countries were selected remotely.
 Candidates had to be at least 18 years old, have a good knowledge of English, have a higher or vocational secondary education, and possess teamwork skills.
 Volunteers were trained remotely, in volunteer centres and at World Cup venues.
 Volunteers will be providing assistance in a variety of areas:
 Their work started ahead of the events: on 10 May 2017 for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and on 10 May 2018 for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
 On 20 October 2017, the Russian National Competition of Important Social Projects ""Legacy of 2018 FIFA World Cup Volunteer Program"" was launched. The competition has engaged about 1500 people: applicants to the 2018 FIFA World Cup volunteer program and future city volunteers.
 The idea of the competition was that anyone could submit a project that would draw the attention of Russian cities residents to the FIFA World Cup in Russia and leave a legacy after the championship was over.
 The project was expected to produce tangible (work of art, place of attraction for guests and residents in the city, open playground, graffiti, developed areas in city parks, films, etc.) or intangible (events, conferences, festivals, exhibitions) legacy.
 26 projects qualified to the final and were supported by the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee and the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The jury included the General Director of the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee Alexey Sorokin, Ambassador of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia Alexey Smertin and Advisor to the Head of the Federal Tourism Agency Svetlana Sergeeva.
 Some of the projects were combined or further developed by the Local Organising Committee.
 Among the projects were: Football Championship for Moms, Ramp Production out of Recycled Plastic, Your Championship Sticker Packs, etc.[35]
 Designated days, weeks and years observed by a country or as designated by the United Nations to encourage volunteering / community service 
 Modern societies share a common value of people helping each other; not only do volunteer acts assist others, but they also benefit the volunteering individual on a personal level.[36] Despite having similar objectives, tension can arise between volunteers and state-provided services. In order to curtail this tension, most countries develop policies and enact legislation to clarify the roles and relationships among governmental stakeholders and their voluntary counterparts; this regulation identifies and allocates the necessary legal, social, administrative, and financial support of each party. This is particularly necessary when some voluntary activities are seen as a challenge to the authority of the state(e.g., on 29 January 2001, President Bush cautioned that volunteer groups should supplement—not replace—government agencies’ work).[37]
 Volunteering that benefits the state but challenges paid counterparts angers labor unions that represent those who are paid for their volunteer work; this is particularly seen in combination departments, such as volunteer fire departments.
 Difficulties in the cross-national aid model of volunteering can arise when it is applied across national borders. The presence of volunteers who are sent from one state to another can be viewed as a breach of sovereignty and showing a lack of respect towards the national government of the proposed recipients. Thus, motivations are important when states negotiate offers to send aid and when these proposals are accepted, particularly if donors may postpone assistance or stop it altogether. Three types of conditionality have evolved:
 Some international volunteer organizations define their primary mission as being altruistic: to fight poverty and improve the living standards of people in the developing world, (e.g. Voluntary Services Overseas has almost 2,000 skilled professionals working as volunteers to pass on their expertise to local people so that the volunteers' skills remain long after they return home). When these organizations work in partnership with governments, the results can be impressive. However, when other organizations or individual First World governments support the work of volunteer groups, there can be questions as to whether the organizations' or governments' real motives are poverty alleviation. Instead, a focus on creating wealth for some of the poor or developing policies intended to benefit the donor states is sometimes reported.[38] Many low-income countries’ economies suffer from industrialization without prosperity and investment without growth. One reason for this is that development assistance guides many Third World governments to pursue development policies that have been wasteful, ill-conceived, or unproductive; some of these policies have been so destructive that the economies could not have been sustained without outside support.[39]
 Indeed, some offers of aid have distorted the general spirit of volunteering, treating local voluntary action as contributions in kind, i.e., existing conditions requiring the modification of local people's behavior in order for them to earn the right to donors’ charity. This can be seen as patronizing and offensive to the recipients because the aid expressly serves the policy aims of the donors rather than the needs of the recipients.
 Based on a case study in China, Xu and Ngai (2011) revealed that the developing grassroots volunteerism can be an enclave among various organizations and may be able to work toward the development of civil society in the developing countries. The researchers developed a ""Moral Resources and Political Capital"" approach to examine the contributions of volunteerism in promoting the civil society. Moral resource means the available morals could be chosen by NGOs. Political capital means the capital that will improve or enhance the NGOs’ status, possession or access in the existing political system.[40]
 Moreover, Xu and Ngai (2011) distinguished two types of Moral Resources: Moral Resource-I and Moral Resource-II (ibid).
 Thanks to the intellectual heritage of Blau and Duncan (1967), two types of political capital were identified:
 Obviously, ""Moral resource-I itself contains the self-determination that gives participants confidence in the ethical beliefs they have chosen"",[44] almost any organizations may have Moral Resource-I, while not all of them have the societal recognized Moral Resource-II. However, the voluntary service organizations predominantly occupy Moral Resource-II because a sense of moral superiority makes it possible that for parties with different values, goals and cultures to work together in promoting the promotion of volunteering. Thus the voluntary service organizations are likely to win the trust and support of the masses as well as the government more easily than will the organizations whose morals are not accepted by mainstream society. In other words, Moral Resource II helps the grassroots organizations with little Political Capital I to win Political Capital-II, which is a crucial factor for their survival and growth in developing countries such as China. Therefore, the voluntary service realm could be an enclave of the development of civil society in the developing nations.[40]
 Volunteering has the ability to improve the quality of life and health including longevity of those who donate their time [45] and research has found that older adults will benefit the most from volunteering. Physical and mental ailments plaguing older adults can be healed through the simple act of helping others; however, one must be performing the good deed from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent older adults from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the communities in which one serves, but also the life of the individual who is providing help to the community.
 Volunteering is known not only to be related to happiness [46] but also to increase happiness.[46][47] Also, giving help was a more important benefit of better reported mental health than receiving help.[48] Studies have also shown that volunteering can cause a decrease in  loneliness for those volunteering as well as those for whom people volunteer.[49]
 In the United States, statistics on volunteering have historically been limited, according to volunteerism expert Susan J. Ellis.[50] In 2013, the U.S. Current Population Survey (US) included a volunteering supplement which produced statistics on volunteering.[51]
 In the 1960s, Ivan Illich offered an analysis of the role of American volunteers in Mexico in his speech entitled ""To Hell With Good Intentions"". His concerns, along with those of critics such as Paulo Freire and Edward Said, revolve around the notion of altruism as an extension of Christian missionary ideology. In addition, he mentions the sense of responsibility/obligation as a factor, which drives the concept of noblesse oblige—first developed by the French aristocracy as a moral duty derived from their wealth. Simply stated, these apprehensions propose the extension of power and authority over indigenous cultures around the world. Recent critiques of volunteering come from Westmier and Kahn (1996) and bell hooks (née Gloria Watkins) (2004). Also, Georgeou (2012) has critiqued the impact of neoliberalism on international aid volunteering.
 The field of the medical tourism (referring to volunteers who travel overseas to deliver medical care) has recently attracted negative criticism when compared to the alternative notion of sustainable capacities, i.e., work done in the context of long-term, locally-run, and foreign-supported infrastructures.  A preponderance of this criticism appears largely in scientific and peer-reviewed literature.[52][53][54] Recently, media outlets with more general readerships have published such criticisms as well.[55]
 Another problems noted with volunteering is that it can be used to replace low paid entry positions. This can act to decrease social mobility, with only those capable of affording to work without payment able to gain the experience.[56] Trade unions in the United Kingdom have warned that long term volunteering is a form of expoitation, used by charities to avoid minimum wage legislation.[57] Some sectors now expect candidates for paid roles to have undergone significant periods of volunteer experience whether relevant to the role or not, setting up 'Volunteer Credentialism'[58]"
charitableorganizations	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization	"A charitable organization[1] or charity is a non-profit organization whose primary objectives are philanthropy and social well-being (e.g. charitable, educational, religious, or other activities serving the public interest or common good).
 The legal definition of a charitable organization (and of charity) varies between countries and in some instances regions of the country. The regulation, the tax treatment, and the way in which charity law affects charitable organizations also vary. Charitable organizations may not use any of its funds to profit individual persons or entities.[2]
 Financial figures (e.g. tax refund, revenue from fundraising, revenue from sale of goods and services or revenue from investment) are indicators to assess the financial sustainability of a charity, especially to charity evaluators. This information can impact a charity's reputation with donors and societies, and thus the charity's financial gains.
 Charitable organizations often depend partly on donations from businesses. Such donations to charitable organizations represent a major form of corporate philanthropy.[3]
 Until the mid-18th century, charity was mainly distributed through religious structures (such as the English Poor Laws of 1601), almshouses and bequests from the rich. Both Christianity and Islam incorporated significant charitable elements from their very beginnings[4] and dāna (alms-giving) has a long tradition in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. Charities provided education, health, housing and even prisons. Almshouses were established throughout Europe in the Early Middle Ages to provide a place of residence for poor, old and distressed people; King Athelstan of England (reigned 924-939) founded the first recorded almshouse in York in the 10th century.[5]
 In the Enlightenment era charitable and philanthropic activity among voluntary associations and rich benefactors became a widespread cultural practice. Societies, gentleman's clubs, and mutual associations began to flourish in England, and the upper-classes increasingly adopted a philanthropic attitude toward the disadvantaged. In England this new social activism was channeled into the establishment of charitable organizations; these proliferated from the middle of the 18th century.[6]
 This emerging upper-class fashion for benevolence resulted in the incorporation of the first charitable organizations. Captain Thomas Coram, appalled by the number of abandoned children living on the streets of London, set up the Foundling Hospital in 1741 to look after these unwanted orphans in Lamb's Conduit Fields, Bloomsbury. This, the first such charity in the world,[7] served as the precedent for incorporated associational charities in general.[8]
 Jonas Hanway, another notable philanthropist of the Enlightenment era, established The Marine Society in 1756 as the first seafarer's charity, in a bid to aid the recruitment of men to the navy.[9] By 1763 the Society had recruited over 10,000 men; an Act of Parliament incorporated it in 1772. Hanway was also instrumental in establishing the Magdalen Hospital to rehabilitate prostitutes. These organizations were funded by subscription and run as voluntary associations. They raised public awareness of their activities through the emerging popular press and were generally held[by whom?] in high social regard - some charities received state recognition in the form of the royal charter.
 Charities also began to adopt campaigning roles, where they would champion a cause and lobby the government for legislative change. This included organized campaigns against the ill treatment of animals and children and the campaign that eventually succeeded at the turn of the 19th century in ending the slave trade throughout the British Empire and within its considerable sphere of influence. (This process was however a lengthy one, which finally concluded when Saudi Arabia abolished slavery in 1962.)
 The Enlightenment also saw growing philosophical debate between those who championed state intervention and those who believed that private charities should provide welfare. The Reverend Thomas Malthus (1766-1834), the political economist, criticized poor relief for paupers on economic and moral grounds and proposed leaving charity entirely to the private sector.[10] His views became very influential and informed the Victorian laissez-faire attitude toward state intervention for the poor.
 During the 19th century a profusion of charitable organizations emerged to alleviate the awful conditions of the working class in the slums. The Labourer's Friend Society, chaired by Lord Shaftesbury in the United Kingdom in 1830, aimed to improve working-class conditions. It promoted, for example, the allotment of land to labourers for ""cottage husbandry"" that later became the allotment movement. In 1844 it became the first Model Dwellings Company - one of a group of organizations that sought to improve the housing conditions of the working classes by building new homes for them, at the same time receiving a competitive rate of return on any investment. This was one of the first housing associations, a philanthropic endeavour that flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century brought about by the growth of the middle class. Later associations included the Peabody Trust (originating in 1862) and the Guinness Trust (founded in 1890). The principle of philanthropic intention with capitalist return was given[by whom?] the label ""five per cent philanthropy"".[11]
 There was strong growth in municipal charities. The Brougham Commission led on to the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which reorganized multiple local charities by incorporating them into single entities under supervision from local government.
 Charities at the time, including the Charity Organization Society (established in 1869) tended to discriminate between the ""deserving poor"" who would be provided with suitable relief and the ""underserving"" or ""improvident poor"" who were regarded[by whom?] as the cause of their own woes through their idleness. Charities tended to oppose the provision of welfare by the state, due to the perceived demoralizing effect. Although minimal state involvement was the dominant philosophy of the period, there was still significant government involvement in the shape of statutory regulation and even limited funding.[12]
 Philanthropy became a very fashionable activity among the expanding middle classes in Britain and America. Octavia Hill (1838-1912) and John Ruskin (1819-1900) were an important force behind the development of social housing, and Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919) exemplified the large-scale philanthropy of the newly rich in industrialized America. In Gospel of Wealth (1889), Carnegie wrote about the responsibilities of great wealth and the importance of social justice. He established public libraries throughout the English-speaking countries[13] as well as contributing large sums to schools and universities.[14] A little over ten years after his retirement, Carnegie had given away over 90% of his fortune.[15]
 Towards the end of the 19th century, with the advent of the New Liberalism and the innovative work of Charles Booth on documenting working-class life in London, attitudes towards poverty began to change, which led to the first social liberalwelfare reforms, including the provision of old age pensions[16] and free school-meals.[17]
 During the 20th century charitable organizations such as Oxfam (established in 1947), Care International and Amnesty International greatly expanded, becoming large, multinational, non-governmental organizations with very large budgets.
 With the advent of the Internet, charitable organizations established a presence in online social media and started (for example) cyber-basedhumanitarian crowdfunding.
 The definition of charity in Australia is derived through English common law, originally from the Charitable Uses Act 1601, and then through several centuries of case law based upon it. In 2002, the federal government established an inquiry into the definition of a charity. The inquiry proposed a statutory definition of a charity, based on the principles developed through case law. This resulted in the Charities Bill 2003, which included limitations on involvement of charities in political campaigning, which many charities saw as an unwelcome departure from the case law. The government appointed a Board of Taxation inquiry to consult with charities on the bill. As a result of widespread criticism from charities, the government abandoned the bill.
 The government then introduced what became the Extension of Charitable Purpose Act 2004, which did not attempt to codify the definition of a charitable purpose, but merely sought to clarify that certain purposes were charitable, whose charitable status had been subject to legal doubts. These purposes included childcare, self-help groups, and closed/contemplative religious orders.[18]
 To publicly raise funds, a charity in Australia must register in each Australian jurisdiction in which it intends to raise funds. In Queensland, for example, charities must register with the Queensland Office of Fair Trading.[19] Also, any charity fundraising online must have approval in every Australian jurisdiction that requires them to do so, which is currently New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory. For example, Donate Your Day Ltd,[20][21] is a purely online New South Wales based charity. Many Australian charities have called on federal, state, and territory governments to enact uniform legislation to enable charities registered in a state or territory to be allowed to raise funds in all other Australian jurisdictions.
 The Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission commenced operations in December 2012 and regulates the approximately 56,000 non-profit organizations with tax exempt status, and about 600,000 other NPO in total and seeks to harmonise state-based fund-raising laws.[22]
 Charities in Canada must be registered with the Charities Directorate[23] of the Canada Revenue Agency. According to the Canada Revenue Agency:[24]
 A registered charity is an organization established and operated for charitable purposes, and must devote its resources to charitable activities. The charity must be resident in Canada, and cannot use its income to benefit its members.
A charity also has to meet a public benefit test. To qualify under this test, an organization must show that:
 
To register as a charity, the organization has to be either incorporated or governed by a legal document called a trust or a constitution. This document has to explain the organization's purposes and structure. The legal situation in Singapore is regulated in the Singapore Charities Act (Chapter 37).[25]  Charities in Singapore must be registered with the Charities Directorate of the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports.[26] One can also find specific organizations that are members of the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) which is operated by the Ministry of Social and Family Development.
 Charity law within the UK varies among (i) England and Wales, (ii) Scotland and (iii) Northern Ireland, but the fundamental principles are the same.  Most organizations that are charities are required to registered with the appropriate regulator for their jurisdiction, but significant exceptions apply so that many organizations are bona fide charities but do not appear on a public register.[citation needed] The registers are maintained by the Charity Commission for England and Wales and for Scotland by the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator. The Charity Commission for Northern Ireland maintains a register of charities that have completed formal registration (see below). Organizations applying must meet the specific legal requirements summarized below, and have filing requirements with their regulator, and are subject to inspection or other forms of review. The oldest charity in the UK is The King's School, Canterbury established in 597.[27]
 The Transparency of Lobbying, Non-party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014 subjects charities to regulation by the Electoral Commission in the run-up to a general election.[28]
 Section 1 Charities Act 2011 provides the definition in England and Wales:
 The Charities Act 2011 provides the following list of charitable purposes.[29]
 A charity must also provide a public benefit.[30]
 Before the Charities Act 2006, which introduced the definition now contained in the 2011 Act, the definition of charity arose from a list of charitable purposes in the Charitable Uses Act 1601 (also known as the Statute of Elizabeth), which had been interpreted and expanded into a considerable body of case law.  In Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v. Pemsel (1891), Lord McNaughten identified four categories of charity which could be extracted from the Charitable Uses Act and which were the accepted definition of charity prior to the Charities Act 2006.
 Charities in England and Wales – such as Age UK, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) [31] and the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals (RSPCA) [32] – must comply with the 2011 Act regulating matters such as charity reports and accounts and fundraising.
 As of 2011[update], there are a number of types of legal structure for a charity in England and Wales.
 The unincorporated association is the most common form of organization within the voluntary sector in England and Wales.[33] This is essentially a contractual arrangement between individuals who have agreed to come together to form an organization for a particular purpose. An unincorporated association will normally have as its governing document a constitution or set of rules, which will deal with such matters as the appointment of office bearers, and the rules governing membership. The organization is not though a separate legal entity, so it cannot start legal action, it cannot borrow money, and it cannot enter into contracts in its own name. Its officers can be personally liable if the charity is sued or has debts.[34]
 A trust is essentially a relationship among three parties: the donor of some assets, the trustees who hold the assets, and the beneficiaries (those people who are eligible to benefit from the charity). When the trust has charitable purposes, and is a charity, the trust is known as a charitable trust. The governing document is the trust deed or declaration of trust, which comes into operation once it is signed by all the trustees. The main disadvantage of a trust is that, as with an unincorporated association, it does not have a separate legal entity and the trustees must themselves own property and enter into contracts. The trustees are also liable if the charity is sued or incurs liability.
 A company limited by guarantee is a private limited company where the liability of members is limited. A guarantee company does not have a share capital, but instead has members who are guarantors instead of shareholders. In the event of the company being wound up, the members agree to pay a nominal sum which can be as little as £1. A company limited by guarantee is a useful structure for a charity where it is desirable for the trustees to have the protection of limited liability. Also, the charity has legal personality, and so can enter into contracts, such as employment contracts in its own name.[35]
 A small number of charities are incorporated by royal charter, a document which creates a corporation with legal personality (or, in some instances, transforms a charity incorporated as a company into a charity incorporated by royal charter). The charter must be approved by the Privy Council before receiving royal assent. Although the nature of the charity will vary depending on the clauses enacted, generally a royal charter will offer a charity the same limited liability as a company and the ability to enter into contracts.
 The Charities Act 2006 legislated for a new legal form of incorporation designed specifically for charities, the charitable incorporated organization, with powers similar to a company but without the need to register as a company. Becoming a CIO was only made possible in 2013, with staggered introduction dates, with the charities with highest turnover eligible first.
 The word foundation is not generally used in England and Wales. Occasionally, a charity will use the word as part of its name, e.g. British Heart Foundation, but this has no legal significance and does not provide any information about either the work of the charity or how it is legally structured. The structure of the organization will be one of the types of structure described above.
 Charitable organizations that have an income of more than £5,000, and for whom the law of England and Wales applies, must register with the Charity Commission for England and Wales, unless they are an ""exempt"" or ""excepted"" charity.[36][37] For companies, the law of England and Wales will normally apply if the company itself is registered in England and Wales. In other cases, if the governing document does not make it clear, the law which applies will be the country with which the organization is most connected.[38]
 When an organization's income does not exceed £5,000, it is not able to register as a charity with the Charity Commission for England and Wales. It can, however, register as a charity with HM Revenue and Customs for tax purposes only.  With the rise in mandatory registration level, to £5,000 by The Charities Act 2006, smaller charities can be reliant upon HMRC recognition to evidence their charitable purpose and confirm their not-for-profit principles.[39]
 Some charities which are called exempt charities are not required to register with the Charity Commission and are not subject to any of the Charity Commission's supervisory powers. These charities include most universities and national museums and some other educational institutions. Other charities are excepted from the need to register, but are still subject to the supervision of the Charity Commission. The regulations on excepted charities have however been changed by the Charities Act 2006. Many excepted charities are religious charities.[40]
 The Charity Commission for Northern Ireland was established in 2009[41] and has received the names and details of over 7,000 organizations in Northern Ireland that have previously been granted charitable status for tax purposes (the ""deemed list""). Compulsory registration of organizations from the deemed list began in December 2013, and it is expected to take three to four years to complete.[42] The new Register of Charities is publicly available on the CCNI website and contains the details of those organizations who have so far been confirmed by the Commission to exist for charitable purposes and the public benefit. The Commission estimates that there are between 5,000 and 11,500 charitable organizations to be formally registered in total.[43]
 The 24,000 or so charities in Scotland are registered with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR), which also publishes a register of charities online.
 Charitable organizations, including charitable trusts, are eligible for a complex set of reliefs and exemptions from taxation in the UK. These include reliefs and exemptions in relation to income tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, stamp duty land tax and value added tax.  These tax exemptions have led to criticisms that private schools are able to use charitable status as a tax avoidance technique rather than because they offer a genuine charitable good.[44]
 There is no legal framework for the registration of charities in Ireland. The Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Charities Section maintains a database of organizations[45] to which they have granted charitable tax exemption. In granting tax exemption, Charities Section gives the body a CHY reference number. The full list of bodies granted exemption is published on the Revenue Commissioners website.
 The Irish Nonprofits Database was created by Irish Nonprofits Knowledge Exchange (INKEx) to act as a repository for regulatory and voluntarily disclosed information about Irish public benefit nonprofits. The organization is currently looking for government funding to continue to provide the service.
 Legislation of charitable activity and obtainment of charitable organization status is regulated by the Civil Code of Ukraine and by Law of Ukraine Charitable Activities and Charitable Organizations.
 By Ukrainian law, there are three forms of charitable organization: 
 Ministry of justice of Ukraine is the main registration authority for charitable organization registration/constitution.[46] Individuals and legal entities, except for public authorities, local governments can be the founders of charitable organizations. Charitable societies and charitable foundations may have (besides founders) other participants who have joined them in the way prescribed by the charters of such charitable associations or charitable foundations. Aliens (non-Ukrainian citizens and legal entities, corporations or non-governmental organizations) can be the founders and members of philanthropic organization in Ukraine.
 All funds received by a charitable organization that were used for charity purposes are exempt from taxation, but it requires obtaining of non-profit status from tax authority.
 Legalization needed for International charitable fund to make activity in Ukraine.[clarification needed]
 In the United States, a charitable organization is an organization operated for purposes that are beneficial to the public interest.[47] There are different types of charitable organizations. Every U.S. and foreign charity that qualifies as tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code is considered a ""private foundation"" unless it demonstrates to the IRS that it falls into another category. Generally, any organization that is not a private foundation (i.e., it qualifies as something else) is usually a public charity as described in Section 509(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.[48]
 In addition, a private foundation usually derives its principal funding from an individual, family, corporation, or some other single source and is more often than not a grantmaker and does not solicit funds from the public. In contrast, a foundation or public charity generally receives grants from individuals, government, and private foundations, and while some public charities engage in grantmaking activities, most conduct direct service or other tax-exempt activities. Foundations that are generally grantmakers (i.e. they use their endowment to make grants to other organizations, which in turn carry out the goals of the foundation indirectly) are usually called ""grantmaker"" or ""non-operating"" foundations.[citation needed]
 The requirements and procedures for forming charitable organizations vary from state to state, as do the registration and filing requirements for charitable organizations that conduct charitable activities, solicit charitable contributions, or hire professional fundraisers.[49][50] In practice, the detailed definition of ""charitable organization"" is determined by the requirements of state law where the charitable organization operates, and the requirements for federal tax relief by the IRS.
 Resources exist to provide information, even rankings, of US charities.[51]
 Federal tax law provides tax benefits to nonprofit organizations recognized as exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The benefits of 501(c)(3) status include exemption from federal income tax as well as eligibility to receive tax deductible charitable contributions. To qualify for 501(c)(3) status most organizations must apply to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for such status.[52]
 Several requirements must be met for a charitable organization to obtain 501(c)(3) status. These include the organization being organized as a corporation, trust, or unincorporated association, and the organization's organizing document (such as the articles of incorporation, trust documents, or articles of association) must limit its purposes to being charitable, and permanently dedicate its assets to charitable purposes. The organization must refrain from undertaking a number of other activities such as participating in the political campaigns of candidates for local, state or federal office, and must ensure that its earnings do not benefit any individual.[47]  Most tax exempt organizations are required to file annual financial reports (IRS Form 990) at the state and federal level. A tax exempt organization's 990 and some other forms are required to be made available to public scrutiny.
 The types of charitable organization that are considered by the IRS to be organized for the public benefit include those that are organized for:
 A number of other organizations may also qualify for exempt status, including those organized for religious, scientific, literary and educational purposes, as well as those for testing for public safety and for fostering national or international amateur sports competition, and for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals."

 Governing doctrines
 A charitable trust is an irrevocable trust established for charitable purposes and, in some jurisdictions, a more specific term than ""charitable organization"". A charitable trust enjoys a varying degree of tax benefits in most countries. It also generates good will. Some important terminology in charitable trusts is the term ‘corpus’ (Latin for ‘body’) which refers to the assets with which the trust is funded and the term ‘donor’ which is the person donating assets to a charity.[1]
 In India, trusts  set up for the social causes and  approved by the Income Tax Department get not only exemption from payment of tax but also the donors to such trusts can deduct the amount of donation to the trust from their taxable income.[2] The legal framework in India recognizes activities including ""relief of the poor, education, medical relief, preserving monuments and environment, and the advancement of any other object of general public utility"" as charitable purposes.[3] Companies formed under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2017 for promoting charity also receive benefits under law including exemption from various procedural provisions of the Companies Act, either fully or in part, and are also entitled to such other exemptions that the Central Government may accord through its orders.[4]
 In the Islamic Republic of Iran religious charitable trusts, or bonyads, make up a substantial part of the country's economy, controlling an estimated 20% of Iran's GDP. Unlike some other Muslim-majority countries, the bonyads receive large and controversial subsidies from the Iranian government.[5]
 In England and Wales, charitable trusts are a form of express trust dedicated to charitable goals. There are a variety of advantages to charitable trust status, including exemption from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust.[6] To be a valid charitable trust, the organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit.[7] Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into four categories; trusts for the relief of poverty, trusts for the promotion of education, trusts for the promotion of religion, and all other types of trust recognised by the law, which includes trusts for the benefit of animals and trusts for the benefit of a locality. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.[8]
 Such trusts will be invalid in several circumstances; charitable trusts are not allowed to be run for profit,[9] nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose).[10] In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable.[11] Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries.[6] This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.[12]
 Jurisdiction over charitable disputes is shared equally between the High Court of Justice and the Charity Commission.[13] The Commission, the first port of call, is tasked with regulating and promoting charitable trusts, as well as providing advice and opinions to trustees on administrative matters.[14] Where the Commission feels there has been mismanagement or maladministration, it can sanction the trustees, removing them, appointing new ones or temporarily taking the trust property itself to prevent harm being done.[13] Where there are flaws with a charity, the High Court can administer schemes directing the function of the charity.[15]
 In the United States, many individuals use charitable trusts to leave all or a portion of their estate to charity when they die, both for philanthropic purposes and for certain tax benefits. Charitable trusts may be set up inter vivos (during a donor's life) or as a part of a trust or will at death (testamentary). There are two basic types of US charitable trusts- charitable remainder trusts and charitable lead trusts.
 Charitable remainder trusts are irrevocable structures established by a donor to provide an income stream to the income beneficiary, while the public charity or private foundation receives the remainder value when the trust terminates. These ""split interest"" trusts are defined in §664 of the Internal Revenue Code and are normally tax-exempt. A section 664 trust makes its payments, either of a fixed amount (charitable remainder annuity trust) or a percentage of trust principal (charitable remainder unitrust),[16] to either the donor or another named beneficiary. If the trust qualifies under IRS code, the donor may claim a charitable income tax deduction for their donation to the trust. Additionally, the donor may not have to pay an immediate capital gains tax when the trust disposes of the appreciated asset and purchases other income-generating assets to fund the trust. At the end of the trust term, which may be based on either lives or a term of years, the charity receives whatever amount is left in the trust.[17] Charitable remainder unitrusts provide some flexibility in the distribution of income, and may be helpful in retirement planning, while charitable remainder annuity trusts paying a fixed dollar amount are more rigid and usually appeal to much older donors unconcerned about inflation's impact on income distributions who are using cash or marketable securities to fund the trust.[18]
 Charitable lead trusts are the opposite of charitable remainder trusts and first make payments to charity for the term of the trust.  As with charitable remainder trust, payments may be either of a fixed amount (charitable lead annuity trust) or a percentage of trust principal (charitable lead unitrust). At the end of the trust term, the remainder can either go back to the donor or to heirs named by the donor. The donor may sometimes claim a charitable income tax deduction or a gift/estate tax deduction for making a lead trust gift, depending on the type of a charitable lead trust. Generally, a non-grantor lead trust does not generate a current income tax deduction, but it eliminates the asset (or part of the asset's value) from the donor's estate.[19]"
Foundation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(nonprofit)	"A foundation (also a charitable foundation) is a category of nonprofit organization or charitable trust that will typically provide funding and support for other charitable organizations through grants, but may engage directly in charitable activities.[1] Foundations include public charitable foundations, such as community foundations, and private foundations which are typically endowed by an individual or family.  The term ""foundation"" though may be used by organizations not involved in public grant making.[2]
 Legal entities existing under the status of ""foundations"" have a wide diversity of structures and purposes. Nevertheless, there are some common structural elements.
 Some of the above must be, in most jurisdictions, expressed in the document of establishment. Others may be provided by the supervising authority at each particular jurisdiction.[citation needed]
 There is no commonly accepted legal definition in Europe for a foundation. There is a proposal for a European Foundation, a legal form that would be recognised throughout Europe, see European Foundation Project.[citation needed]
 The term ""foundation,"" in general, is used to describe a distinct legal entity. Foundations as legal structures (legal entities) and/or legal persons (legal personality), may have a diversity of forms and may follow diverse regulations depending on the jurisdiction where they are created. Foundations are often set up for charitable purposes, family patrimony and collective purposes.
 In some jurisdictions, a foundation may acquire its legal personality when it is entered in a public registry, while in other countries a foundation may acquire legal personality by the mere action of creation through a required document. Unlike a company, foundations have no shareholders, though they may have a board, an assembly and voting members. A foundation may hold assets in its own name for the purposes set out in its constitutive documents, and its administration and operation are carried out in accordance with its statutes or articles of association rather than fiduciary principles. The foundation has a distinct patrimony independent of its founder.
 In Finland, foundations are regulated by the Finnish Patent and Registration Office and have the four following characteristics:[3]
 Foundations are considered legal persons in Finland. The Foundations Act in 2015 dramatically updated the laws regarding foundations.[4]
 There are not many Foundations in comparison to the rest of Europe. In practice public administration requires at least €1 million necessary. States representatives have a mandatory seat in the Board.[5]
 German regulations allow the creation of any foundation for public or private purposes in keeping with the concept of a gemeinwohlkonforme Allzweckstiftung (""general-purpose foundation compatible with the common good""). A foundation should not have commercial activities as its main purpose, but they are permitted if they serve the main purpose of the foundation. There is no minimum starting capital, although in practice at least  is considered necessary.
 A German foundation can either be charitable or serve a private interest. Charitable foundations enjoy tax exemptions. If they engage in commercial activities, only the commercially active part of the entity is taxed. A family foundation serving private interests is taxed like any other legal entity. There is no central register for German foundations.
 Only charitable foundations are subject to supervision by state authorities. Family foundations are not supervised after establishment. All forms of foundations can be dissolved, however, if they pursue anti-constitutional aims. Foundations are supervised by local authorities within each state (Bundesland) because each state has exclusive legislative power over the laws governing foundations.
 In contrast to many other countries, German law allows a tax sheltered charitable foundation to distribute up to one third of its profit to the founder and his next of kin, if they are needy, or to maintain the founder's grave. These benefits are subject to taxation.
 As of 2008[update], there are about 15,000 foundations in Germany, about 85% of them charitable foundations. More than 250 charitable German foundations have existed for more than 500 years; the oldest dates back to 1509. There are also large German corporations owned by foundations, including Bertelsmann, Bosch, Carl Zeiss AG and Lidl. Foundations are the main providers of private scholarships to German students.
 In Italy, a foundation is a private non profit and autonomous organization, its assets must be dedicated to a purpose established by the founder. The founder cannot receive any benefits from the foundation or have reverted the initial assets. The private foundations or civil code foundations are under the section about non commercial entities of the first book (Libro Primo) of the Civil Code of Law (Codice Civile) from 1942. The Art. 16 CC establishes that the statutes of the foundation must contain its name, purpose, assets, domicile, administrative organs and regulations, and how the grants will be distributed. The founder must write a declaration of intention including a purpose and endow assets for such  purpose. This document can be in the form of a notarised deed or a will. To obtain legal personality, the foundation must enroll in the legal register of each Prefettura (local authority) or some cases the regional authority. There are several nuances in requirements according to each foundation's purpose and area of activity.

 A foundation (Fundação) in Portugal is regulated by Law 150/2015,[6] with the exception of religious foundations, which are regulated by the Religious Freedom Law. Foundations may be private, wholly public (created and managed exclusively by public bodies), or public but with private management (created by public entities and optionally also private entities, but whose management is dominated by private entities). Foundations may only be operational after being recognized by the Prime Minister of Portugal.
 Foundations must designate and pursue at least one of twenty-five public benefit goals defined by law. They must also have enough assets to pursue those goals. They may not benefit the founders or any other restricted group, but the general public.
 Portuguese foundations may voluntarily associate themselves via the Portuguese Foundation Centre (CPF – Centro Português de Fundações), that was founded in 1993 by the Eng. António de Almeida Foundation, the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and the Oriente Foundation.[7]
 Foundations in Spain are organizations founded with the purpose of not seeking profit and serving the general needs of the public.  Such foundation may be founded by private individuals or by the public. These foundations have an independent legal personality separate from their founders. Foundations serve the general needs of the public with a patrimony that funds public services and which may not be distributed to the founders' benefit.
 A foundation in Sweden (Stiftelse) is a legal entity without an owner. It is formed by a letter of donation from a founder donating funds or assets to be administered for a specific purpose. When the purpose is for the public benefit, a foundation may enjoy favourable tax treatment. A foundation may have diverse purposes, including but not limited to public benefit, humanitarian or cultural purposes, religious, collective, familiar, or the simple passive administration of funds. Normally, the supervision of a foundation is done by the county government where the foundation has its domicile, however, large foundations must be registered by the County Administrative Board (CAB), which must also supervise the administration of the foundation.
The main legal instruments governing foundations in Sweden are the Foundation Act (1994:1220) and the Regulation for Foundations (1995:1280).
 Under Canadian law, foundations may be public or private, but both are charities.[citation needed]  They collectively comprise a large asset base for philanthropy
 The law does not prescribe any particular form for a foundation in Ireland. Most commonly, foundations are companies limited by guarantee or trusts.  A foundation can obtain a charity registration number from the Revenue Commissioners for obtaining tax relief as far as they can be considered under the law on charity, however, charitable status does not exist in Ireland. The definition usually applied is that from the Pemsel Case of English jurisprudence (1891) and the Irish Income Tax Act 1967.
Trusts have no legal personality and companies acquire their legal status through the Company law and the required documents of incorporation. Foundations are not required to register with any public authority.
 In the UK, the word ""foundation"" is sometimes used in the title of a charity, as in the British Heart Foundation and the Fairtrade Foundation. Despite this, the term is not generally used in English law, and (unlike in civil law systems) the term has no precise meaning. Instead, the concept of Charitable Trust is in use (for example, the Wellcome Trust).
 In the United States, many philanthropic and charitable organizations (such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) are considered to be foundations. However, the Internal Revenue Code distinguishes between private foundations (usually funded by an individual, family, or corporation) and public charities (community foundations or other nonprofit groups that raise money from the general public). While they offer donors more control over their charitable giving, private foundations have more restrictions and fewer tax benefits than public charities.
 The States of Jersey are considering introducing civil law type foundations into its law. A consultation paper presenting a general discussion on foundations was brought forth to the Jersey government concerning this possibility. It was adopted by the states of Jersey on 22 October 2008  – Foundations (Jersey) Law 200-
 At an international level there are a series of networks and associations of foundations, among them Council on Foundations,[8] EFC (European Foundation Centre),[9] WINGS (Worldwide Initiatives for Grantmaker Support).[10][11] Those organization also have a role in supporting research on foundations."
Private	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_foundation	"A private foundation is a charitable organization that, while serving a good cause, might not qualify as a public charity by government standards.[1] The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest private foundation in the U.S. with over $38 billion in assets.[2] Most private foundations are much smaller. Approximately two-thirds of the more than 84,000 foundations which file with the IRS, in 2008, have less than $1 million in assets, and 93% have less than $10 million in assets.[2] In aggregate, private foundations in the U.S. control over $628 billion in assets[2] and made more than $44 billion in charitable contributions in 2007.[3]
 Unlike a charitable foundation, a private foundation does not generally solicit funds from the public. And a private foundation does not have the legal requirements and reporting responsibilities of a registered, non-profit or charitable foundation. Not all foundations engage in philanthropy: some private foundations are used for estate planning purposes.
 One of the characteristics of the legal entities existing under the status of ""Foundations"" is a wide diversity of structures and purposes. Nevertheless, there are some common structural elements that are the first observed under legal scrutiny or classification.
 Some of the above must be, in most jurisdictions, expressed in the document of establishment. Others may be provided by the supervising authority at each particular jurisdiction.
 The following foundations are set up under common law legal systems:
 Foundations were first introduced in The Bahamas in December 2004 following the Foundations Act. [1]
 A private foundation, in the United States, is a charitable organization described in the Internal Revenue Code by section 509.[4]  A private foundation is necessarily a 501(c)(3) exempt organization (or a former such entity).  It is defined by a negative definition: by what it is not.  A private foundation is not a public charity, as described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (i) through (vi).  Neither is it a section 509(a)(2) organization, nor a supporting organization.[5]  Private foundations are subject to 2% excise taxes found in section 4940 through 4945 of the internal revenue code.[6] Once a charity becomes a private foundation, it retains that status unless it follows the difficult termination rules of section 507.
 Every organization that qualifies for tax exemption as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) is a private foundation unless it falls into one of the categories specifically excluded from the definition of that term (referred to in section 509(a)). In addition, certain nonexempt charitable trusts are also treated as private foundations. Organizations that fall into the excluded categories are institutions such as hospitals or universities and those that generally have broad public support or actively function in a supporting relationship to such organizations.[7]
 In the United States, there are several restrictions and requirements on private foundations, including:
 Violations of these provisions give rise to taxes and penalties against the private foundation and, in some cases, its managers, its substantial contributors, and certain related persons.[7]
 The following foundations are set up under civil law legal systems:
 The Austrian Private Foundation (Privatstiftung) was last reformed under the Private Foundation Act in September 1993. The Austrian private foundation is considered a legal person having beneficiaries rather than shareholders or proprietors and may be established for any purpose.[8]
 In Canada the Canada Revenue Agency is a branch of the Canadian government which regulates all foundations. Under Canadian law, since 1967, a private foundation is controlled by a single donor or family through a board that is made up of a majority (more than 50%) of directors at non-arm’s length. It is a legally registered charity with the Canada Revenue Agency. A public foundation is governed by a board that is made up of a majority of directors at arm’s length. A private foundation is not allowed to engage in any business activity, but it can operate its own charitable program.[9]
 Canada Revenue Agency designates the application as a “charitable organization,” a “public foundation,” or a “private foundation,” depending on its structure, its source of funding and its operation. The Income Tax Act requirements are different, depending on the type of charity.(Canada Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985 (5th supp.) c. 1, para. 149.1(4)(a))[10]
 The Liechtenstein Family Foundation (Stiftung) was first introduced in 1926 and updated by the Act Reforming the Persons and Companies Act in 2008 which included a new Act on Foundations.[11]
 The Mauritius Foundation was introduced following 'The Foundations Act' of 2012.[12]
 A foundation in the Netherlands (Stichting) is a legal person created through a legal act. This act is usually either a notarised deed (or a will) that contains the articles of the foundation which must include the first appointed board.[13]
 Foundation legislation was last reformed in 1998, giving rise to the Netherlands Antilles Private Foundation (Stichting Particulier Fonds).[14]
 The Nevis Multiform Foundation was introduced in 2005.[15]
 The Panama Private Interest Foundation was introduced following the Law 25, June 12, 1995. [16]
 The Saint Kitts Foundation was introduced following the Foundation Act of 2003.[17]
 The Seychelles Foundation was introduced following the Foundation Act of 2009.[18]

Mutual-benefit nonprofit corporation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual-benefit_nonprofit_corporation	"A mutual-benefit nonprofit corporation or membership corporation is a type of nonprofit corporation in the US, similar to other mutual benefit organizations found in some of common law nations, chartered by government with a mandate to serve the mutual benefit of its members.
 A mutual-benefit corporation can be non-profit or not-for-profit in the United States, but it cannot obtain IRS 501(c)(3) non-profit status as a charitable organization.[1] It is distinct in U.S. law from public-benefit nonprofit corporations, and religious corporations. Mutual benefit corporations must still file tax returns and pay income tax because they are not formed for a purpose that is meant to benefit the general public (unlike public-benefit nonprofit corporations) but rather to provide an association of people with a common benefit. Due to its private purpose, a mutual benefit corporation pays the same taxes as a regular for-profit corporation (C corporation tax rates). However, the IRS still allows for tax exemptions for certain types of mutual-benefit nonprofits (501(c)(6)).
 Mutual benefit corporations are formed for common gain purposes such as providing insurance for members (many insurance companies still have ""mutual"" in their names, though many have since adopted other corporate forms), establishing a community financial institution, managing common property, or promoting the social or economic welfare of member individuals or organizations (for example through trade groups, professional organizations or business districts). Some mutual water companies are organized as mutual benefit corporations; an electric membership corporation is another example.  
 Mutual benefit corporations have their roots in the benefit societies that sprang up to offer services and solidarity to workers during the Industrial Revolution, though most today do not have any particular connection to labor movements."
Non-governmental organization	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization	"Non-governmental organizations—also called nongovernmental[1] or nongovernment organizations[2][3]—commonly referred to as NGOs,[4] are usually non-profit and sometimes international organizations[5] independent of governments and international governmental organizations (though often funded by governments)[6] that are active in humanitarian, educational, health care, public policy, social, human rights, environmental, and other areas to effect changes according to their objectives.[7][8][9][10] They are thus a subgroup of all organizations founded by citizens, which include clubs and other associations that provide services, benefits, and premises only to members. Sometimes the term is used as a synonym of ""civil society organization"" to refer to any association founded by citizens,[11] but this is not how the term is normally used in the media or everyday language, as recorded by major dictionaries. The explanation of the term by NGO.org (the non-governmental organizations associated with the United Nations) is ambivalent. It first says an NGO is any non-profit, voluntary citizens' group which is organized on a local, national or international level, but then goes on to restrict the meaning in the sense used by most English speakers and the media: Task-oriented and driven by people with a common interest, NGOs perform a variety of service and humanitarian functions, bring citizen concerns to Governments, advocate and monitor policies and encourage political participation through provision of information.[12]
 NGOs are usually funded by donations, but some avoid formal funding altogether and are run primarily by volunteers. NGOs are highly diverse groups of organizations engaged in a wide range of activities, and take different forms in different parts of the world. Some may have charitable status, while others may be registered for tax exemption based on recognition of social purposes. Others may be fronts for political, religious, or other interests. Since the end of World War II, NGOs have had an increasing role in international development,[13] particularly in the fields of humanitarian assistance and poverty alleviation.[14]
 The number of NGOs worldwide is estimated to be 10 million.[15] Russia had about 277,000 NGOs in 2008.[16] India is estimated to have had around 2 million NGOs in 2009, just over one NGO per 600 Indians, and many times the number of primary schools and primary health centres in India.[17][18]
 The term 'NGO' is not always used consistently.  In some countries the term NGO is applied to an organization that in another country would be called an NPO (non-profit organization), and vice versa. Political parties and trade unions are considered NGOs only in some countries. There are many different classifications of NGO in use. The most common focus is on ""orientation"" and ""level of operation"". An NGO's orientation refers to the type of activities it takes on. These activities might include human rights, environmental, improving health, or development work. An NGO's level of operation indicates the scale at which an organization works, such as local, regional, national, or international.[19]
 The term ""non-governmental organization"" was first coined in 1945, when the United Nations (UN) was created.[20] The UN, itself an intergovernmental organization, made it possible for certain approved specialized international non-state agencies — i.e., non-governmental organizations — to be awarded observer status at its assemblies and some of its meetings. Later the term became used more widely. Today, according to the UN, any kind of private organization that is independent from government control can be termed an ""NGO"", provided it is not-for-profit, non-prevention,[clarification needed] but not simply an opposition political party.
 One characteristic these diverse organizations share is that their non-profit status means they are not hindered by short-term financial objectives. Accordingly, they are able to devote themselves to issues which occur across longer time horizons, such as climate change, malaria prevention, or a global ban on landmines. Public surveys reveal that NGOs often enjoy a high degree of public trust, which can make them a useful - but not always sufficient - proxy for the concerns of society and stakeholders.[21]
 NGO/GRO (governmental-related organizations) types can be understood by their orientation and level of how they operate.
 Apart from ""NGO"", there are alternative or overlapping terms in use, including: third-sector organization (TSO), non-profit organization (NPO), voluntary organization (VO), civil society organization (CSO), grassroots organization (GO), social movement organization (SMO), private voluntary organization (PVO), self-help organization (SHO) and non-state actors (NSAs).
 In Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian and other Romance languages, the 'mirrored' abbreviation ""ONG"" is in use, which has the same meaning as ""NGO"" (for example Organisation non-gouvernementale in French, Organização Não Governamental in Portuguese, Organización no gubernamental in Spanish, or Organizzazione non governativa in Italian).
 Governmental-related organizations / non-governmental organizations are a heterogeneous group. As a result, a long list of additional acronyms has developed, including:
 USAID refers to NGOs as private voluntary organizations.[25] However, many scholars have argued that this definition is highly problematic as many NGOs are in fact state- or corporate-funded and -managed projects and have professional staff.[citation needed]
 GRO/NGOs exist for a variety of reasons, usually to further the political or social goals of their members or founders. Examples include improving the state of the natural environment, encouraging the observance of human rights, improving the welfare of the disadvantaged, or representing a corporate agenda. However, there are a huge number of such organizations and their goals cover a broad range of political and philosophical positions. This can also easily be applied to private schools and athletic organizations.
 Track II dialogue, or Track II diplomacy, is transnational coordination that involves non-official members of the government including epistemic communities as well as former policy-makers or analysts. Track II diplomacy aims to get policymakers and policy analysts to come to a common solution through discussions by unofficial means. Unlike the Track I diplomacy where government officials, diplomats and elected leaders gather to talk about certain issues, Track II diplomacy consists of experts, scientists, professors and other figures that are not involved in government affairs. The members of Track II diplomacy usually have more freedom to exchange ideas and come up with compromises on their own.
 There are numerous classifications of NGOs. The typology the World Bank uses divides them into Operational and Advocacy.[26]
 Generally, NGOs act as implementers, catalysts, and partners. Firstly, NGOs act as implementers in that they mobilize resources in order to provide goods and services to people who are suffering due to a man-made disaster or a natural disaster. Secondly, NGOs act as catalysts in that they drive change. They have the ability to 'inspire, facilitate, or contribute to improved thinking and action to promote change'. Lastly, NGOs often act as partners alongside other organizations in order to tackle problems and address human needs more effectively.[27]
 NGOs vary in their methods. Some act primarily as lobbyists, while others primarily conduct programs and activities. For instance, an NGO such as Oxfam, concerned with poverty alleviation, may provide needy people with the equipment and skills to find food and clean drinking water, whereas an NGO like the FFDA helps through investigation and documentation of human rights[citation needed] violations and provides legal assistance to victims of human rights abuses. Others, such as the Afghanistan Information Management Services, provide specialized technical products and services to support development activities implemented on the ground by other organizations.
 Operational NGOs seek to ""achieve small-scale change directly through projects"".[23] They mobilize financial resources, materials, and volunteers to create localized programs. They hold large-scale fundraising events and may apply to governments and organizations for grants or contracts to raise money for projects. They often operate in a hierarchical structure; a main headquarters being staffed by professionals who plan projects, create budgets, keep accounts, and report and communicate with operational fieldworkers who work directly on projects.[23] Operational NGOs deal with a wide range of issues, but are most often associated with the delivery of services or environmental issues, emergency relief, and public welfare. Operational NGOs can be further categorized by the division into relief-oriented versus development-oriented organizations; according to whether they stress service delivery or participation; whether they are religious or secular; and whether they are more public- or private-oriented. Although operational NGOs can be community-based, many are national or international. The defining activity of operational NGOs is the implementation of projects.[23]
 Campaigning NGOs seek to ""achieve large-scale change promoted indirectly through influence of the political system"".[23]
Campaigning NGOs need an efficient and effective group of professional members who are able to keep supporters informed, and motivated. They must plan and host demonstrations and events that will keep their cause in the media. They must maintain a large informed network of supporters who can be mobilized for events to garner media attention and influence policy changes. The defining activity of campaigning NGOs is holding demonstrations.[23] Campaigning NGOs often deal with issues relating to human rights, women's rights, and children's rights. The primary purpose of an Advocacy NGO is to defend or promote a specific cause. As opposed to operational project management, these organizations typically try to raise awareness, acceptance and knowledge by lobbying, press work and activist event.[citation needed]
 It is not uncommon for NGOs to make use of both activities. Many times, operational NGOs will use campaigning techniques if they continually face the same issues in the field that could be remedied through policy changes. At the same time, Campaigning NGOs, like human rights organizations often have programs that assist the individual victims they are trying to help through their advocacy work.[23]
 Non-governmental organizations need healthy relationships with the public to meet their goals. Foundations and charities use sophisticated public relations campaigns to raise funds and employ standard lobbying techniques with governments. Interest groups may be of political importance because of their ability to influence social and political outcomes. A code of ethics was established in 2002 by The World Association of Non Governmental Organizations.
 There is an increasing awareness that management techniques are crucial to project success in non-governmental organizations.[28] Generally, non-governmental organizations that are private have either a community or environmental focus. They address varieties of issues such as religion, emergency aid, or humanitarian affairs. They mobilize public support and voluntary contributions for aid; they often have strong links with community groups in developing countries, and they often work in areas where government-to-government aid is not possible. NGOs are accepted as a part of the international relations landscape, and while they influence national and multilateral policy-making, increasingly they are more directly involved in local action.
 Some NGOs are highly professionalized and rely mainly on paid staff. Others are based around voluntary labour and are less formalized. Not all people working for non-governmental organizations are volunteers.
 Many NGOs are associated with the use of international staff working in 'developing' countries, but there are many NGOs in both North and South who rely on local employees or volunteers. There is some dispute as to whether expatriates should be sent to developing countries. Frequently this type of personnel is employed to satisfy a donor who wants to see the supported project managed by someone from an industrialized country. However, the expertise of these employees or volunteers may be counterbalanced by a number of factors: the cost of foreigners is typically higher, they have no grassroot connections in the country they are sent to, and local expertise is often undervalued.[26]
 The NGO sector is an essential employer in terms of numbers.[citation needed] For example, by the end of 1995, CONCERN worldwide, an international Northern NGO working against poverty, employed 174 expatriates and just over 5,000 national staff working in ten developing countries in Africa and Asia, and in Haiti.
 Whether the NGOs are small or large, various NGOs need budgets to operate. The amount of money that each requires varies depending upon multiple factors, including the size of the operation and the extent of the services provided. Unlike small NGOs, large NGOs may have annual budgets in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. For instance, the budget of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) was over US$540 million in 1999.[29] Funding such large budgets demands significant fundraising efforts on the part of most NGOs. Major sources of NGO funding are membership dues, the sale of goods and services, grants from international institutions or national governments, and private donations. Several EU-grants provide funds accessible to NGOs.
 Even though the term ""non-governmental organization"" implies independence from governments, many NGOs depend heavily on governments for their funding.[30] A quarter of the US$162 million income in 1998 of the famine-relief organization Oxfam was donated by the British government and the EU. The Christian relief and development organization World Vision United States collected US$55 million worth of goods in 1998 from the American government.
 Government funding of NGOs is controversial, since, according to David Rieff, writing in The New Republic, ""the whole point of humanitarian intervention was precisely that NGOs and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them, whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter.""[31] Some NGOs, such as Greenpeace do not accept funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations.[32][33]
 Overhead is the amount of money that is spent on running an NGO rather than on projects.[34] This includes office expenses,[34] salaries, banking and bookkeeping costs. What percentage of overall budget is spent on overhead is often used to judge an NGO with less than 4% being viewed as good.[34] The World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations states that ideally more than 86% should be spent on programs (less than 20% on overhead).[35] The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has specific guidelines on how high overhead can be to receive funding based on how the money is to be spent with overhead often needing to be less than 5-7%.[36] While the World Bank typically allows 37%.[37] A high percentage of overhead to total expenditures can make it more difficult to generate funds.[38] High overhead costs may also generate criticism with some claiming the certain NGOs with high overhead are being run simply to benefit the people working for them.[39]
 While overhead costs can be a legitimate concern, a sole focus on them can be counterproductive.[40] Research published by the Urban Institute and the Center for Social Innovation at Stanford University have shown how rating agencies create incentives for non-profits to lower and hide overhead costs, which may actually reduce organizational effectiveness by starving organizations of the infrastructure they need to effectively deliver services.[41][42] A more meaningful rating system would provide, in addition to financial data, a qualitative evaluation of an organization’s transparency and governance: (1) an assessment of program effectiveness; (2) and an evaluation of feedback mechanisms designed for donors and beneficiaries; and (3) such a rating system would also allow rated organizations to respond to an evaluation done by a rating agency.[43] More generally, the popular discourse of non-profit evaluation should move away from financial notions of organizational effectiveness and toward more substantial understandings of programmatic impact.
 In the March 2000 report on United Nations Reform priorities, former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan wrote in favor of international humanitarian intervention, arguing that the international community has a ""right to protect""[44] citizens of the world against ethnic cleansing, genocide, and crimes against humanity. On the heels of the report, the Canadian government launched the Responsibility to Protect R2P[45] project, outlining the issue of humanitarian intervention. While the R2P doctrine has wide applications, among the more controversial has been the Canadian government's use of R2P to justify its intervention and support of the coup in Haiti.[46]
Years after R2P, the World Federalist Movement, an organization which supports ""the creation of democratic global structures accountable to the citizens of the world and call for the division of international authority among separate agencies"", has launched Responsibility to Protect - Engaging Civil Society (R2PCS). A collaboration between the WFM and the Canadian government, this project aims to bring NGOs into lockstep with the principles outlined under the original R2P project.
 The governments of the countries an NGO works or is registered in may require reporting or other monitoring and oversight. Funders generally require reporting and assessment, such information is not necessarily publicly available. There may also be associations and watchdog organizations that research and publish details on the actions of NGOs working in particular geographic or program areas.[citation needed]
 In recent years, many large corporations have increased their corporate social responsibility departments in an attempt to preempt NGO campaigns against certain corporate practices. As the logic goes, if corporations work with NGOs, NGOs will not work against corporations. Greater collaboration between corporations and NGOs creates inherent risks of co-optation for the weaker partner, typically the non-profit involved.[47]
 In December 2007, The United States Department of Defense Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) S. Ward Casscells established an International Health Division under Force Health Protection & Readiness.[48] Part of International Health's mission is to communicate with NGOs in areas of mutual interest. Department of Defense Directive 3000.05,[49] in 2005, requires DoD to regard stability-enhancing activities as a mission of importance equal to combat. In compliance with international law, DoD has necessarily built a capacity to improve essential services in areas of conflict such as Iraq, where the customary lead agencies (State Department and USAID) find it difficult to operate. Unlike the ""co-option"" strategy described for corporations, the OASD(HA) recognizes the neutrality of health as an essential service. International Health cultivates collaborative relationships with NGOs, albeit at arm's length, recognizing their traditional independence, expertise and honest broker status. While the goals of DoD and NGOs may seem incongruent, the DoD's emphasis on stability and security to reduce and prevent conflict suggests, on careful analysis, important mutual interests.
 International non-governmental organizations have a history dating back to at least the late eighteenth century.[50][51] It has been estimated that by 1914, there were 1083 NGOs.[52] International NGOs were important in the anti-slavery movement and the movement for women's suffrage, and reached a peak at the time of the World Disarmament Conference.[53] However, the phrase ""non-governmental organization"" only came into popular use with the establishment of the United Nations Organization in 1945 with provisions in Article 71 of Chapter 10 of the United Nations Charter[54] for a consultative role for organizations which are neither governments nor member states—see Consultative Status [55]. The definition of ""international NGO"" (INGO) is first given in resolution 288 (X) of ECOSOC on February 27, 1950: it is defined as ""any international organization that is not founded by an international treaty"". The vital role of NGOs and other ""major groups"" in sustainable development was recognized in Chapter 27[56] of Agenda 21, leading to intense arrangements for a consultative relationship between the United Nations and non-governmental organizations.[57] It has been observed that the number of INGO founded or dissolved matches the general ""state of the world"", rising in periods of growth and declining in periods of crisis.[58]
 Rapid development of the non-governmental sector occurred in western countries as a result of the processes of restructuring of the welfare state. Further globalization of that process occurred after the fall of the communist system and was an important part of the Washington consensus.[30]
 Globalization during the 20th century gave rise to the importance of NGOs. Many problems could not be solved within a nation. International treaties and international organizations such as the World Trade Organization were centered mainly on the interests of capitalist enterprises. In an attempt to counterbalance this trend, NGOs have developed to emphasize humanitarian issues, developmental aid and sustainable development. A prominent example of this is the World Social Forum, which is a rival convention to the World Economic Forum held annually in January in Davos, Switzerland. The fifth World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in January 2005 was attended by representatives from more than 1,000 NGOs.[59] In terms of environmental issues and sustainable development, the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992 was the first to show the power of international NGOs, when about 2,400 representatives of NGOs came to play a central role in deliberations. Some have argued that in forums like these, NGOs take the place of what should belong to popular movements of the poor. Whatever the case, NGO transnational networking is now extensive.[60]
 The legal form of NGOs is diverse and depends upon homegrown variations in each country's laws and practices. However, four main family groups of NGOs can be found worldwide:[61]
 The Council of Europe in Strasbourg drafted the European Convention on the Recognition of the Legal Personality of International Non-Governmental Organizations in 1986, which sets a common legal basis for the existence and work of NGOs in Europe. Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights protects the right to freedom of association, which is also a fundamental norm for NGOs.
 Service-delivery NGOs provide public goods and services that governments from developing countries are unable to provide to society, due to lack of resources. Service-delivery NGOs can serve as contractors or collaborate with democratized government agencies to reduce cost associated with public goods. Capacity-building NGOs influence global affairs differently, in the sense that the incorporation of accountability measures in Southern NGOs affect ""culture, structure, projects and daily operations"".[62] Advocacy and public education NGOs affect global affairs in its ability to modify behavior through the use of ideas. Communication is the weapon of choice used by advocacy and public-education NGOs in order to change people's actions and behaviors. They strategically construct messages to not only shape behavior, but to also socially mobilize communities in promoting social, political, or environmental changes. Movement NGOs mobilizes the public and coordinate large-scale collective activities to significantly push forward activism agenda.[63]
 In the post-Cold War era, more NGOs based in developed countries have pursued international outreach and became involved in local and national level social resistance and become relevant to domestic policy change in the developing world.[64] In for the cases where national governments are highly sensitive to external influences via non-state actors, specialized NGOs have been able to find the right partners (e.g., China), building up solid working networks, locating a policy niche and facilitating domestic changes.

 European Union External Action Service, Official Statement by the Spokesperson of HR/VP Federica Mogherini on the occasion of the WORLD NGO DAY 2017.- Bruxelles, 27/02/2017 - ID: 170227_11 '.[66]
 World NGO Day is observed annually on 27 February. It was officially recognised and declared on 17 April 2010 by 12 countries of the IX Baltic Sea NGO Forum to the 8th Summit of the Baltic Sea States in Vilnius, Lithuania.[67] The World NGO Day was internationally marked and recognised on 28 February 2014 in Helsinki, Finland by Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Former Prime Minister of New Zealand who congratulated with the World NGO Day and highlighted the importance of NGO sector for the UN through her speech.[68][69][70]
 Issa G. Shivji is one of Africa's leading experts on law and development issues as an author and academic. His critique on NGOs is found in two essays: ""Silences in NGO discourse: The role and future of NGOs in Africa"" and ""Reflections on NGOs in Tanzania: What we are, what we are not and what we ought to be"". Shivji argues that despite the good intentions of NGO leaders and activists, he is critical of the ""objective effects of actions, regardless of their intentions"".[71] Shivji argues also that the sudden rise of NGOs are part of a neoliberal paradigm rather than pure altruistic motivations. He is critical of the current manifestations of NGOs wanting to change the world without understanding it, and that the imperial relationship continues today with the rise of NGOs.
 James Pfeiffer, in his case study of NGO involvement in Mozambique, speaks to the negative effects that NGO's have had on areas of health within the country. He argues that over the last decade, NGO's in Mozambique have ""fragmented the local health system, undermined local control of health programs, and contributed to growing local social inequality"".[72]
 He notes further that NGO's can be uncoordinated, creating parallel projects among different organizations, that pull health service workers away from their routine duties in order to serve the interests of the NGO's. This ultimately undermines local primary health care efforts, and takes away the governments' ability to maintain agency over their own health sector.[72]
J. Pfeiffer suggested a new model of collaboration between the NGO and the DPS (the Mozambique Provincial Health Directorate). He mentioned the NGO should be 'formally held to standard and adherence within the host country', for example reduce 'showcase' projects and parallel programs that proves to be unsustainable.[72]
 Jessica Mathews wrote in Foreign Affairs in 1997: ""For all their strengths, NGOs are special interests. The best of them … often suffer from tunnel vision, judging every public act by how it affects their particular interest"".[73] Since NGOs do not have to worry about policy trade-offs, the overall impact of their cause might bring more harm to society.[74]
 Vijay Prashad argues that from the 1970s ""The World Bank, under Robert McNamara, championed the NGO as an alternative
to the state, leaving intact global and regional relations of power and production.""[75]
 Others argue that NGOs are often imperialist[76] in nature, that they sometimes operate in a racialized manner in third world countries, and that they fulfill a similar function to that of the clergy during the high colonial era. The philosopher Peter Hallward argues that they are an aristocratic form of politics.[77] He also points to the fact that NGOs like Action Aid and Christian Aid ""effectively condoned the [2004 US backed] coup"" against an elected government in Haiti and argues that they are the ""humanitarian face of imperialism"".[78] Popular movements in the global South such as the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign in South Africa have sometimes refused to work with NGOs arguing that this will compromise their autonomy.[79][80] It has also been argued that NGOs often disempower people by allowing funders to push for stability over social justice.[81]
 Another criticism of NGOs is that they are being designed and used as extensions of the normal foreign-policy instruments of certain Western countries and groups of countries.[82][83] Russian President Vladimir Putin made this accusation at the 43rd Munich Conference on Security Policy in 2007, concluding that these NGOs ""are formally independent but they are purposefully financed and therefore under control"".[84]
Also, Michael Bond wrote ""Most large NGOs, such as Oxfam, the Red Cross, Cafod and Action Aid, are striving to make their aid provision more sustainable. But some, mostly in the US, are still exporting the ideologies of their backers.""[85]
 NGOs have also been accused of using white lies or misinformed advise to enact their campaigns, i.e., accusations that NGOs have been ignorant about critical issues because, as chief scientist at Greenpeace Doug Parr said, these organizations appear to have lost their efforts in being truly scientific and now seem to be more self-interested. Rather than operating through science so as to be rationally and effectively practical, NGOs have been accused of abusing the utilization of science to gain their own advantages. In the beginning, as Parr indicated, there was ""a tendency among our critics to say that science is the only decision-making tool … but political and commercial interests are using science as a cover for getting their way.""[86] At the same time, NGOs can appear to not be cooperative with other groups, according to the previous policy-maker for the German branch of Friends of the Earth, Jens Katjek. ""If NGOs want the best for the environment"", he says, ""they have to learn to compromise.""[86]
 NGOs have also been questioned as being ""too much of a good thing"".[87] Eric Werker and Faisal Ahmed bring up three potential critiques of the role of NGOs in developing nations: too many NGOs in a nation—particularly one ruled by a warlord—reduces the NGO's ability to establish a credible threat of removing humanitarian assistance since they can easily be replaced by another NGO; the frequent process of resource allocation and outsourcing to local organizations in international development projects results in high expenses for NGOs and rings into question how much of the resources and money actually goes to the intended beneficiaries at the end of the allocation process; and finally, NGO missions tend to be too paternalistic and expensive, though Werker and Ahmed propose that vouchers are a good way to overcome this obstacle.[87]
 The issue of the legitimacy of NGOs raises a series of important questions. Legitimacy is one of the most important assets possessed by an NGO and is gained due to them being perceived as an “independent voice”.[88][89] Their representation also emerges as an important question. Who bestows responsibilities to NGOs or INGOs and how do they gain the representation of citizens and civil society is still not scrutinized thoroughly. For instance, in the article, it is stated, ""To put the point starkly: are the citizens of countries of the South and their needs represented in global civil society, or are citizens as well as their needs constructed by practices of representation? And when we realize that INGOs hardly ever come face to face with the people whose interests and problems they represent, or that they are not accountable to the people they represent, matters become even more troublesome.""[90]
 The origin of funding can have serious implications for the legitimacy of NGOs. In recent decades NGOs have increased their numbers and range of activities to a level where they have become increasingly dependent on a limited number of donors.[91] Consequently, competition has increased for funding, as have the expectations of the donors themselves.[92] This runs the risk of donors adding conditions which can threaten the independence of NGOs; for example, an over-dependence on official aid has the potential to dilute “the willingness of NGOs to speak out on issues which are unpopular with governments”.[89] In these situations NGOs are being held accountable by their donors, which can erode rather than enhance their legitimacy, a difficult challenge to overcome. Some commentators have also argued that the changes in NGO funding sources has ultimately altered their functions.[89][93][94]
 NGOs have also been challenged on the grounds that they do not necessarily represent the needs of the developing world, through diminishing the so-called “Southern Voice”. Some postulate that the North–South divide exists in the arena of NGOs.[95] They question the equality of the relationships between Northern and Southern parts of the same NGOs as well as the relationships between Southern and Northern NGOs working in partnerships. This suggests a division of labour may develop, with the North taking the lead in advocacy and resource mobilisation whilst the South engages in service delivery in the developing world.[95] The potential implications of this may mean the needs of the developing world are not addressed appropriately as Northern NGOs do not properly consult or participate in partnerships. The real danger in this situation is that western views may take the front seat and assign unrepresentative priorities.[96]
 The flood of NGOs has also been accused of damaging the public sector in multiple developing countries, e.g. accusations that NGO mismanagement has resulted in the breakdown of public health care systems. Instead of promoting equity and alleviating poverty, NGOs have been under scrutiny for contributing to socioeconomic inequality and disempowering services in the public sector of third world countries.[72][97]
 The scale and variety of activities in which NGOs participate has grown rapidly since the 1980s, witnessing particular expansion in the 1990s.[98] This has presented NGOs with a need to balance the pressures of centralisation and decentralisation. By centralising NGOs, particularly those that operate at an international level, they can assign a common theme or set of goals. Conversely it may also be advantageous to decentralise as this can increase the chances of an NGO responding more flexibly and effectively to localised issues by implementing projects which are modest in scale, easily monitored, produce immediate benefits and where all involved know that corruption will be punished.[97][99]"
Nonprofit organization	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization	"A nonprofit organization, also known as a non-business entity,[1] not-for-profit organization,[2] or nonprofit institution,[3] is dedicated to furthering a particular social cause or advocating for a shared point of view. In economic terms, it is an organization that uses its surplus of the revenues to further achieve its ultimate objective, rather than distributing its income to the organization's shareholders, leaders, or members. Nonprofits are tax exempt or charitable, meaning they do not pay income tax on the money that they receive for their organization. They can operate in religious, scientific, research, or educational settings.
 The key aspects of nonprofits are accountability, trustworthiness, honesty, and openness to every person who has invested time, money, and faith into the organization. Nonprofit organizations are accountable to the donors, funders, volunteers, program recipients, and the public community. Public confidence is a factor in the amount of money that a nonprofit organization is able to raise. The more nonprofits focus on their mission, the more public confidence they will have, and as a result, more money for the organization.[1] The activities a nonprofit is partaking in can help build the public’s confidence in nonprofits, as well as how ethical the standards and practices are.
 According to the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS), there are more than 1.5 million nonprofit organizations registered in the United States, including public charities, private foundations, and other nonprofit organizations. Contributions to different charities reached $358.38 billion in 2014, which was an increase of 7.1% from the 2013 estimates.  Out of these contributions, Religious organizations received 32%, educational institutions received 15%, and human service organizations received 12%.  Between September 2010 and September 2014, approximately 25.3% of Americans over the age of 16 volunteered for a nonprofit.[4]
 Nonprofits are not driven by generating profit, but they must bring in enough income to pursue their social goals. Nonprofits are able to raise money in different ways.  This includes income from donations from individual donors or foundations; sponsorships from corporations; government funding; programs, services or merchandise sales; and investments.[5] Each NPO is unique in which source of income works best for them.  With an increase in NPO’s within the last decade, organizations have adopted competitive advantages to create revenue for themselves to remain financially stable. Donations from private individuals or organizations can change each year and government grants have diminished.  With changes in funding from year to year, many nonprofit organizations have been moving toward increasing the diversity of their funding sources. For example, many nonprofits that have relied on government grants have started fundraising efforts to appeal to individual donors.
 NPO's challenges primarily stem from lack of funding. Funding can either come from within the organization, fundraising, donations, or from the federal government. When cutbacks are made from the federal government, the organization suffers from devolution. This term describes when there is a shift of responsibility from a central government to a local, subnational authority. The shift is due to the loss of funds; therefore, resulting in changes of responsibilities in running programs. Because of this frequent challenge, management must be innovative and effective in the pursuit of success.
 Nonprofit and not-for-profit are terms that are used similarly, but do not mean the same thing.  Both are organizations that do not make a profit, but may receive an income to sustain their missions.  The income that nonprofit and not-for-profit organizations generate is used differently. Nonprofit organizations return their income back to the organization if they generate extra income.  Not-for-profits use their excess money to pay their members who do work for them. Another difference between nonprofit organizations and not-for-profit organizations is their membership.  Nonprofits have volunteers or employees who do not receive any money from the organization's fundraising efforts. They may earn a salary for their work that is independent from the money the organization has fundraised. Not-for-profit members have the opportunity to benefit from the organization's fundraising efforts.[6]
 In the United States, both nonprofits and not-for-profits are tax exempt under IRS publication 557.  Although they are both tax-exempt, each organization faces different tax code requirements. A nonprofit is tax exempt under 501(c)(3) requirements if it is either a religious, charitable, or educational based organizations that do not influence state and federal legislation.  Not-for-profits are tax exempt under 501(c)(7) requirements if they are an organization for pleasure, recreation or another nonprofit purpose.[6]
 Nonprofits are either member-serving or community-serving. Member-serving nonprofit organizations create a benefit for the members of their organization and can include but are not limited to credit unions, sports clubs, and advocacy groups.  Community-serving nonprofit organizations focus on providing services to the community either globally or locally. Community-serving nonprofits include organizations that deliver aid and development programs, medical research, education, and health services.  It is possible for a nonprofit to be both member-serving and community-serving.
 A common misconception about nonprofits is that they are run completely by volunteers. Most nonprofits have staff that work for the company, possibly using volunteers to perform the nonprofit's services under the direction of the paid staff. Nonprofits must be careful to balance the salaries paid to staff against the money paid to provide services to the nonprofit's beneficiaries. Organizations whose salary expenses are too high relative to their program expenses may face regulatory scrutiny.[7]
 A second misconception is that nonprofit organizations may not make a profit. Although the goal of nonprofits isn't specifically to maximize profits, they still have to operate as a fiscally responsible business. They must manage their income (both grants and donations and income from services) and expenses so as to remain a fiscally viable entity. Nonprofits have the responsibility of focusing on being professional, financially responsible, replacing self-interest and profit motive with mission motive.[8]
 Though nonprofits are managed differently than for-profit businesses, they have felt pressure to be more businesslike. To combat private and public business growth in the public service industry, nonprofits have modeled their business management and mission, shifting their raison d’être to establish sustainability and growth.[9]
 Setting effective missions is a key for the successful management of nonprofit organizations.[10] There are three important conditions for effective mission: opportunity, competence, and commitment.[10]
 One way of managing the sustainability of nonprofit organizations is to establish strong relations with donor groups.[10] This requires a donor marketing strategy, something many nonprofits lack.[10]
 NPOs have a wide diversity of structures and purposes. For legal classification, there are, nevertheless, some elements of importance:
 Some of the above must be (in most jurisdictions in the USA at least) expressed in the organization's charter of establishment or constitution. Others may be provided by the supervising authority at each particular jurisdiction.
 While affiliations will not affect a legal status, they may be taken into consideration by legal proceedings as an indication of purpose. Most countries have laws that regulate the establishment and management of NPOs and that require compliance with corporate governance regimes. Most larger organizations are required to publish their financial reports detailing their income and expenditure publicly.
 In many aspects, they are similar to corporate business entities though there are often significant differences. Both not-for-profit and for-profit corporate entities must have board members, steering-committee members, or trustees who owe the organization a fiduciary duty of loyalty and trust. A notable exception to this involves churches, which are often not required to disclose finances to anyone, including church members.
 In the United States, nonprofit organizations are formed by filing bylaws or articles of incorporation or both in the state in which they expect to operate. The act of incorporation creates a legal entity enabling the organization to be treated as a distinct body (corporation) by law and to enter into business dealings, form contracts, and own property as individuals or for-profit corporations can.
 Nonprofits can have members, but many do not. The nonprofit may also be a trust or association of members. The organization may be controlled by its members who elect the board of directors, board of governors or board of trustees. A nonprofit may have a delegate structure to allow for the representation of groups or corporations as members. Alternatively, it may be a non-membership organization and the board of directors may elect its own successors.
 The two major types of nonprofit organization are membership and board-only. A membership organization elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws. A board-only organization typically has a self-selected board and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board. A board-only organization's bylaws may even state that the organization does not have any membership, although the organization's literature may refer to its donors or service recipients as 'members'; examples of such organizations are FairVote[11][12] and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.[13] The Model Nonprofit Corporation Act imposes many complexities and requirements on membership decision-making.[14] Accordingly, many organizations, such as the Wikimedia Foundation,[15] have formed board-only structures. The National Association of Parliamentarians has generated concerns about the implications of this trend for the future of openness, accountability, and understanding of public concerns in nonprofit organizations. Specifically, they note that nonprofit organizations, unlike business corporations, are not subject to market discipline for products and shareholder discipline of their capital; therefore, without membership control of major decisions such as the election of the board, there are few inherent safeguards against abuse.[16][17] A rebuttal to this might be that as nonprofit organizations grow and seek larger donations, the degree of scrutiny increases, including expectations of audited financial statements.[18] A further rebuttal might be that NPOs are constrained, by their choice of legal structure, from financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to members and directors is concerned.
 In many countries, nonprofits may apply for tax exempt status, so that the organization itself may be exempt from income tax and other taxes. In the United States, to be exempt from federal income taxes, the organization must meet the requirements set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.  Granting nonprofit status is done by the state, while applying for tax-exempt designation (such as 501(c)(3), the charitable tax-exemption) is granted by the federal government in the form of the IRS. ... This means that not all nonprofits are eligible to be tax-exempt.[19] NPOs use the model of a double bottom line in that furthering their cause is more important than making a profit, though both are needed to ensure the organization's sustainability.[20][21]
 In Australia, nonprofit organizations include trade unions, charitable entities, co-operatives, universities and hospitals, mutual societies, grass-root and support groups, political parties, religious groups, incorporated associations, not-for-profit companies, trusts and more. Furthermore, they operate across a multitude of domains and industries, from health, employment, disability and other human services to local sporting clubs, credit unions, and research institutes.[22] A nonprofit organization in Australia can choose from a number of legal forms depending on the needs and activities of the organization: co-operative, company limited by guarantee, unincorporated association, incorporated association (by the Associations Incorporation Act 1985) or incorporated association or council (by the Commonwealth Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976).[23] From an academic perspective, social enterprise is, for the most part, considered a sub-set of the nonprofit sector as typically they too are concerned with a purpose relating to a public good. However, these are not bound to adhere to a nonprofit legal structure, and many incorporate and operate as for-profit entities.
 In Australia, nonprofit organizations are primarily established in one of three ways: companies limited by guarantee, trusts, and incorporated associations. However, the incorporated association form is typically used by organizations intending to operate only within one Australian state jurisdiction. Nonprofit organizations seeking to establish a presence across Australia typically consider incorporating as a company or as a trust.[24]
 By Belgian law, there are several kinds of nonprofit organization:
 These three kinds of nonprofit organization are in contrast to a fourth:
 Canada allows nonprofit organizations to be incorporated or unincorporated. They may incorporate either federally, under Part II of the Canada Business Corporations Act, or under provincial legislation. Many of the governing Acts for Canadian nonprofits date to the early 1900s, meaning that nonprofit legislation has not kept pace with legislation that governs for-profit corporations, particularly with regards to corporate governance.[citation needed] Federal, and in some provinces (including Ontario), incorporation is by way of Letters Patent, and any change to the Letters Patent (even a simple name change) requires formal approval by the appropriate government, as do bylaw changes. Other provinces (including Alberta) permit incorporation as of right, by the filing of Articles of Incorporation or Articles of Association.
 During 2009, the federal government enacted new legislation repealing the Canada Corporations Act, Part II – the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act. This Act was last amended on 10 October 2011, and the act was current until 4 March 2013.[25] It allows for incorporation as of right, by Articles of Incorporation; does away with the ultra vires doctrine for nonprofits; establishes them as legal persons; and substantially updates the governance provisions for nonprofits. Ontario also overhauled its legislation, adopting the Ontario Not-for-Profit Corporations Act during 2010;  the new Act is expected to be in effect as of 1 July 2013.
 Canada also permits a variety of charities (including public and private foundations). Charitable status is granted by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) upon application by a nonprofit; charities are allowed to issue income tax receipts to donors, must spend a certain percentage of their assets (including cash, investments, and fixed assets) and file annual reports in order to maintain their charitable status. In determining whether an organization can become a charity, CRA applies a common law test to its stated objects and activities. These must be:
 Charities are not permitted to engage in partisan political activity; doing so may result in the revocation of charitable status. However, a charity can carry out a small number of political activities that are non-partisan, help further the charities' purposes, and subordinate to the charity's charitable purposes.[27]
 In France, nonprofits are called associations. They are based on a law enacted 1 July 1901. As a consequence, the nonprofits are also called association loi 1901.
 A nonprofit can be created by two people to accomplish a common goal. The association can have industrial or commercial activities or both, but the members cannot make any profit from the activities. Thereby, worker's unions and political parties can be organized from this law.
 In 2008, the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) counted more than a million of these associations in the country, and about 16 million people older than 16 are members of a nonprofit in France (a third or the population over 16 years old). The nonprofits employ 1.6 million people, and 8 million are volunteers for them.[28]
 This law is also relevant in many former French colonies, particularly in Africa.
 The Hong Kong Company Registry provides a memorandum of procedure for applying to Registrar of Companies for a Licence under Section 21 of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32) for a limited company for the purpose of promoting commerce, art, science, religion, charity, or any other useful object.[29][30]
 In India, non-governmental organizations are the most common type of societal institutions that do not have commercial interests. However, they are not the only category of non-commercial organizations that can gain official recognition. For example, memorial trusts, which honor renowned individuals through social work, may not be considered as NGOs.[31][failed verification]
 They can be registered in four ways:
 Registration can be with either the Registrar of Companies (RoC) or the Registrar of Societies (RoS).
 The following laws or Constitutional Articles of the Republic of India are relevant to the NGOs:
 The Irish Nonprofits Database was created by Irish Nonprofits Knowledge Exchange (INKEx) to act as a repository for regulatory and voluntarily disclosed information about Irish public-benefit nonprofits. The database lists more than 10,000 nonprofit organizations in Ireland. In 2012 INKEx ceased to operate due to lack of funding.[32]
 In Israel nonprofit organizations (NPOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are usually established as registered nonprofit associations (Hebrew amutah, plural amutot) or public benefit companies (Hebrew Chevrah LeTo’elet Hatzibur, not to be confused with public benefit corporations). The structure of financial statements of nonprofit organizations is regulated Israel's Accounting Standard No. 5, and must include a balance sheet, a report on activities, the income and expenditure for the particular period, a report on changes in assets, a statement of cash flows, and notes to the financial statements. A report showing the level of restriction imposed on the assets and liabilities can be given, though this is not required.
 ‘‘Amutot’’ are regulated by the Associations Law, 1980. An amutah is a body corporate, though not a company. The amutah is successor to the Ottoman Society which predated the State of Israel, and was established by the now-superseded Ottoman Societies Law of 1909, based on the French law of 1901. Public benefit companies are governed solely by company law; if their regulations and objectives meet the two conditions specified in Section 345A of the Companies Act, they will in effect be amutot in all but name.
 An amutah must register with the Rasham Ha’amutot ('Registrar of Amutot'); a public benefit company must register with the Rasham HaChavarot [Registrar of Companies]. Both are under the purview of the Rashot Hata’agidim ('Corporations Authority') of the Ministry of Justice.
 In Japan, an NPO is any citizen's group that serves the public interest and does not produce a profit for its members. NPOs are given corporate status to assist them in conducting business transactions. As at February 2011, there were 41,600 NPOs in Japan. Two hundred NPOs were given tax-deductible status by the government, which meant that only contributions to those organizations were tax deductible for the contributors.[33]
 In New Zealand, nonprofit organizations usually are established as incorporated societies or charitable trusts.  An incorporated society requires a membership of at least 15 people.
 Russian law contains many legal forms of non-commercial organization (NCO), resulting in a complex, often contradictory, and limiting regulatory framework.[34]  The primary requirements are that NCOs, whatever their type, do not have the generation of profit as their main objective and do not distribute any such profit among their participants (Article 50(1), Civil Code). Most commonly there are five forms of NCO:
 In South Africa, certain types of charity may issue a tax certificate when requested, which donors can use to apply for a tax deduction. Charities/NGOs may be established as voluntary associations, trusts or nonprofit companies (NPCs). Voluntary associations are established by agreement under the common law, and trusts are registered by the Master of the High Court.
 Nonprofit companies (NPCs) are registered by the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission.[36] All of these may voluntarily register with The Directorate for Nonprofit Organisations and may apply for tax-exempt status to the South African Revenue Service (SARS).
 In Ukraine, nonprofit organizations include non-governmental organizations, cooperatives (inc. housing cooperatives), charitable organizations, religious organizations, political parties, commodities exchanges (in Ukraine, commodities exchanges can't be organized for profit) and more. Nonprofit organizations obtain their non-profit status from tax authorities. The state fiscal service is the main registration authority for nonprofit status.[37]
 In the UK a nonprofit organization may take the form of an unincorporated association, a charitable trust, a charitable incorporated organisation (CIO), a company limited by guarantee (which may or may not be charitable), a charter organization (which may or may not be charitable), a charitable company, a community interest company (CIC) (which may or may not be charitable), a community benefit society (which may or may not be charitable), or a cooperative society (which may or may not be charitable). Thus a nonprofit may be charitable (see under Charitable Organisation) or not, and may be required to be registered or not.
 After a nonprofit organization has been formed at the state level, the organization may seek recognition of tax-exempt status with respect to U.S. federal income tax. That is done typically by applying to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), although statutory exemptions exist for limited types of nonprofit organization. The IRS, after reviewing the application to ensure the organization meets the conditions to be recognized as a tax exempt organization (such as the purpose, limitations on spending, and internal safeguards for a charity), may issue an authorization letter to the nonprofit granting it tax-exempt status for income-tax payment, filing, and deductibility purposes. The exemption does not apply to other federal taxes such as employment taxes. Additionally, a tax-exempt organization must pay federal tax on income that is unrelated to their exempt purpose.[38] Failure to maintain operations in conformity to the laws may result in the loss of tax-exempt status.
 Individual states and localities offer nonprofits exemptions from other taxes such as sales tax or property tax. Federal tax-exempt status does not guarantee exemption from state and local taxes and vice versa. These exemptions generally have separate applications, and their requirements may differ from the IRS requirements. Furthermore, even a tax-exempt organization may be required to file annual financial reports (IRS Form 990) at the state and federal levels. A tax-exempt organization's 990 forms are required to be available for public scrutiny.
 The board of directors has ultimate control over the organization, but typically an executive director is hired. In some cases, the board is elected by a membership, but commonly, the board of directors is self-perpetuating. In these 'board-only' organizations, board members nominate new members and vote on their fellow directors' nominations.[39] Part VI Governance, Management, and Disclosure, section A, question 7a of the Form 990 asks 'Did the organization have members, stockholders, or other persons who had the power to elect or appoint one or more members of the governing body?'; the IRS instructions added '(other than the organization's governing body itself, acting in such capacity)'.[40]
 Founder's syndrome is an issue organizations experience as they expand. Dynamic founders, who have a strong vision of how to operate the project, try to retain control of the organization, even as new employees or volunteers want to expand the project's scope or change policy.[41]
 Resource mismanagement is a particular problem with NPOs because the employees are not accountable to anybody who has a direct stake in the organization. For example, an employee may start a new program without disclosing its complete liabilities. The employee may be rewarded for improving the NPO's reputation, making other employees happy, and attracting new donors. Liabilities promised on the full faith and credit of the organization but not recorded anywhere constitute accounting fraud. But even indirect liabilities negatively affect the financial sustainability of the NPO, and the NPO will have financial problems unless strict controls are instated.[42] Some commenters have argued that the receipt of significant funding from large for-profit corporations can ultimately alter the NPO's functions.[43] A frequent measure of an NPO's efficiency is its expense ratio (i.e. expenditures on things other than its programs, divided by its total expenditures).
 Competition for employees with the public and private sector is another problem that nonprofit organizations inevitably face, particularly for management positions. There are reports of major talent shortages in the nonprofit sector today regarding newly graduated workers,[44] and NPOs have for too long relegated hiring to a secondary priority,[45] which could be why they find themselves in the position many do. While many established NPOs are well-funded and comparative to their public sector competitors, many more are independent and must be creative with which incentives they use to attract and maintain vibrant personalities. The initial interest for many is the remuneration package, though many who have been questioned after leaving an NPO have reported that it was stressful work environments and implacable work that drove them away.[46]
 Public- and private-sector employment have, for the most part, been able to offer more to their employees than most nonprofit agencies throughout history. Either in the form of higher wages, more comprehensive benefit packages, or less tedious work, the public and private sectors have enjoyed an advantage over NPOs in attracting employees. Traditionally, the NPO has attracted mission-driven individuals who want to assist their chosen cause. Compounding the issue is that some NPOs do not operate in a manner similar to most businesses, or only seasonally. This leads many young and driven employees to forego NPOs in favor of more stable employment. Today, however, nonprofit organizations are adopting methods used by their competitors and finding new means to retain their employees and attract the best of the newly minted workforce.[47]
 It has been mentioned that most nonprofits will never be able to match the pay of the private sector[48] and therefore should focus their attention on benefits packages, incentives and implementing pleasurable work environments. A good environment is ranked higher than salary and pressure of work.[45] NPOs are encouraged to pay as much as they are able and offer a low-stress work environment that the employee can associate him or herself positively with. Other incentives that should be implemented are generous vacation allowances or flexible work hours.[49]
 Many NPOs often use the .org or .us (or the CCTLD of their respective country) or .edu top-level domain (TLD) when selecting a domain name to differentiate themselves from more commercial entities, which typically use the .com space.

 Instead of being defined by 'non' words, some organizations are suggesting new, positive-sounding terminology to describe the sector. The term 'civil society organization' (CSO) has been used by a growing number of organizations, including the Center for the Study of Global Governance.[50] The term 'citizen sector organization' (CSO) has also been advocated to describe the sector – as one of citizens, for citizens – by organizations including Ashoka: Innovators for the Public.[51] Advocates argue that these terms describe the sector in its own terms, without relying on terminology used for the government or business sectors. However, use of terminology by a nonprofit of self-descriptive language that is not legally compliant risks confusing the public about nonprofit abilities, capabilities, and limitations.[52]
 In some Spanish-language jurisdictions, nonprofit organizations are called ""civil associations"".[citation needed]"
Public-benefit nonprofit corporation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-benefit_nonprofit_corporation	"A public-benefit nonprofit corporation[1] is a type of nonprofit corporation chartered by a state government, and organized primarily or exclusively for social, educational, recreational or charitable purposes by like-minded citizens. Public-benefit nonprofit corporations are distinct in the law from mutual-benefit nonprofit corporations in that they are organized for the general public benefit, rather than for the interest of its members. They are also distinct in the law from religious corporations."
Religious corporation	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_corporation	"A religious corporation is a type of religious non-profit organization, which has been incorporated under the law. Often these types of corporations are recognized under the law on a subnational level, for instance by a state or province government. The government agency responsible for regulating such corporations is usually the official holder of records, for instance the Secretary of State. In the United States, religious corporations are formed like all other nonprofit corporations by filing articles of incorporation with the state. Religious corporation articles need to have the standard tax exempt language the IRS requires.
 In the United States, religious corporations are subject to less rigorous state and federal filing and reporting requirements than many other tax-exempt organizations, such as mutual benefit nonprofit corporations, or public benefit nonprofit corporations.[1] Depending on the state in which they are located, they may also be exempt from some of the inspections or regulations governing non-religious groups performing the same services.[2]
 Religious corporations are permitted to designate a person to act in the capacity of corporation sole. This is a person who acts as the official holder of title on property, etc."
Voluntary association	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association	"A voluntary group or union (also sometimes called a voluntary organization, common-interest association,[1]:266 association, or society) is a group of individuals who enter into an agreement, usually as volunteers, to form a body (or organization) to accomplish a purpose.[2] Common examples include trade associations, trade unions, learned societies, professional associations, and environmental groups.
 Membership is not necessarily voluntary: in order for particular associations to function correctly they might need to be mandatory or at least strongly encouraged, as is common with many teachers unions in the US. Because of this, some people use the term common-interest association to describe groups which form out of a common interest, although this term is not widely used or understood.[1]
 Voluntary associations may be incorporated or unincorporated; for example, in the US, unions gained additional powers by incorporating.[3] In the UK, the terms Voluntary Association or Voluntary Organisation cover every type of group from a small local Residents' Association to large Associations (often  Registered Charities) with multimillion-pound turnover that run large-scale business operations (often providing some kind of public service as subcontractors to government departments or local authorities).
 In many jurisdictions no formalities are necessary to start an association. In some jurisdictions, there is a minimum for the number of persons starting an association.
 Some jurisdictions require that the association register with the police or other official body to inform the public of the association's existence. This could be a tool of political control or intimidation, and also a way of protecting the economy from fraud.
 In many such jurisdictions, only a registered association (or in the UK an incorporated body) is a juristic person whose members are not responsible for the financial acts of the association. Any group of persons may, of course, work as an informal association, but in such cases, each person making a transaction in the name of the association takes responsibility for that transaction, just as if it were that individual's personal transaction.[4]
 There are many countries where the formation of truly independent Voluntary Associations is effectively proscribed by law or where they are theoretically legally permitted, but in practice are persecuted; for example, where membership brings unwelcome attention from police or other state agencies.
 Voluntary groups are a broad and original form of nonprofit organizations, and have existed since ancient history. In Ancient Greece, for example, there were various organizations ranging from elite clubs of wealthy men (hetaireiai)[5] to private religious or professional associations.[6]
 In preindustrial societies, governmental administrative duties were often handled by voluntary associations such as guilds. In medieval Europe, guilds often controlled towns.[7] Merchant guilds enforced contracts through embargoes and sanctions on their members, and also adjudicated disputes.[8] However, by the 1800s, merchant guilds had largely disappeared.[9] Economic historians have debated the precise role that merchant guilds played in premodern society and economic growth.[10]
 In the United Kingdom, craft guilds were more successful than merchant guilds[11] and formed livery companies which exerted significant influence on society.[12]
 A standard definition of an unincorporated association was given by Lord Justice Lawton in the English trust law case Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell (1981):[13]
 ""unincorporated association"" [means] two or more persons bound together for one or more common purposes, not being business purposes, by mutual undertakings, each having mutual duties and obligations, in an organisation which has rules which identify in whom control of it and its funds rests and upon what terms and which can be joined or left at will.[14]
 In most countries, an unincorporated association does not have separate legal personality, and few members of the association usually enjoy limited liability.[15] However, in some countries they are treated as having separate legal personality for tax purposes.[16] However, because of their lack of legal personality, legacies to unincorporated associations are sometimes subject to general common law prohibitions against purpose trusts.
 Associations that are organized for profit or financial gain are usually called partnerships.[17] A special kind of partnership is a co-operative which is usually founded on one person—one vote principle and distributes its profits according to the amount of goods produced or bought by the members. Associations may take the form of a non-profit organization or they may be not-for-profit corporations; this does not mean that the association cannot make benefits from its activity, but all the benefits must be reinvested. Most associations have some kind of document or documents that regulate the way in which the body meets and operates. Such an instrument is often called the organization's bylaws, constitution, regulations, or agreement of association.[18]
 Under English law, an unincorporated association consists of two or more members bound by the rules of a society which has at some point in time, been founded.[19]
 Several theories have been proposed as to the way that such associations hold rights. A transfer may be considered to have been made to the association's members directly as joint tenants or tenants in common. Alternatively, the funds transferred may be considered to have been under the terms of a private purpose trust. Many purpose trusts fail for want of a beneficiary and this may therefore may result in the gift failing. However, some purpose trusts are valid, and, accordingly, some cases have decided that the rights associated with unincorporated associations are held on this basis. The dominant theory, however, is that the rights are transferred to the members or officers absolutely, perhaps on trust for the members, but are importantly bound by contracts inter se.[20]
 Accordingly, on dissolution, the distribution of these rights depends on how they were held. A purpose trust may by its nature survive the dissolution of the association, or it may not. If it fails as a result of the dissolution, then the rights will be held on resulting trust for the contributors, unless they can be shown to have renounced their right to such a trust in their favour. If the rights are held subject to contract, then they will be divided among the surviving membership upon dissolution, according to the terms of the contracts inter se or an implied term according to contribution. If, as a result of this contract or statute, no member can claim, the rights will pass to the Crown as bona vacantia. This conclusion has also been suggested where the association dissolves because only one member remains, although this has been doubted by some commentators who believe the last members should be entitled to the rights.[20]
 Scottish law on unincorporated associations is essentially the same as English law.[21]
 Each state sets its own laws as to what constitutes an unincorporated association and how it is to be treated under the laws. In the United States, voluntary associations which were incorporated were ""pre-eminent"" in collective action.[22]
 In most Australian states and territories, a similar set of laws allows not-for-profit associations to become legal entities with a limit to the liability of their members. An example of such a law, the Associations Incorporation Act that is in force in South Australia, allows for the creation of a legal entity able to buy and sell land and in general, enter into legally binding contracts.[24]  Many clubs and societies begin life as an unincorporated body and seek to attain incorporated status to protect its members from legal liability and in many cases to seek government financial assistance only available to an incorporated body. Clubs and societies wishing to incorporate must meet the provisions of the relevant state act and lodge their constitution with the corresponding state government authority.[25]
 Certain civil-law systems classify an association as a special form of contractual relationship.
 Under the Quebec Civil Code an association is categorized as a type of statutory specific contract set forth in a constitution. An association can become incorporated with its own legal identity so that it may, e.g., open a bank account, enter into contracts (rent real estate, hire employees, take out an insurance policy), or sue or be sued.[citation needed]
 In France, all voluntary associations are non-profit. They may count as unincorporated (association non-déclarée) or incorporated (association déclarée), and are created in terms of and governed by the Waldeck-Rousseau Act 1901. This is why association loi (de) 1901 is subjoined to their name, except in Alsace-Moselle area which is governed by local law in this regard (the area was German in 1901) and are therefore called association loi (de) 1908.[citation needed]. If the association responding to defined criteria, like social or medical help for example, they can be declared ""public utility association"" (association d'utilité publique) by French authorities. Associations act 1901 let an important large of freedom about internal operation, like direction or authorized members for example.
 The German Civil Code sets out different rights and rules for an unincorporated association (nicht eingetragener Verein) with legal identity (Vereine, art. 21-79 BGB) versus an incorporated association (Eingetragener Verein) with full legal personality, which the law treats as partnerships (Gesellschaften, art. 705–740 BGB). Associations can be for-profit (wirtschaftlicher Verein), non-for-profit (Idealverein), or public (gemeinnütziger Verein).[citation needed]
 In Israel, many non-profit organizations (NPOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are established as registered  nonprofit associations (Hebrew amutah, plural amutot) (some are established as public benefit companies (Hebrew Chevrah LeTo’elet Hatzibur) not to be confused with public benefit corporations). ‘‘Amutot’’ are regulated by the Associations Law, 1980. An amutah is a body corporate, though not a company. The amutah is successor to the Ottoman Society which predated the State of Israel, and was established by the now-superseded Ottoman Societies Law of 1909, based on the French law of 1901. An amutah must register with the Rasham Ha’amutot ('Registrar of Amutot'), under the purview of the Rashot Hata’agidim ('Corporations Authority') of the Ministry of Justice.
 The freedom of association stands in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:[26]
 Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights also protects the right to freedom of assembly and association."
Dāna	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C4%81na	"Dāna (Devanagari: दान) is a Sanskrit and Pali word that connotes the virtue of generosity, charity or giving of alms in Indian philosophies.[1][2] It is alternatively transliterated as daana.[3][4]
 In Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, dāna is the practice of cultivating generosity. It can take the form of giving to an individual in distress or need.[5] It can also take the form of philanthropic public projects that empower and help many.[6]
 According to historical records, dāna is an ancient practice in Indian traditions, tracing back to Vedic traditions.[3][7]
 The ancient Tamil moral text of Tirukkural speaks about dāna in two separate chapters, namely, Chapter 22 and Chapter 23.[8]
 Dāna (Sanskrit: दान) means giving, often in the context of donation and charity.[9] In other contexts, such as rituals, it can simply refer to the act of giving something.[9] Dāna is related to and mentioned in ancient texts with concepts of Paropakāra (परोपकार) which means benevolent deed, helping others;[10][11] Dakshina (दक्षिणा) which means gift or fee one can afford;[12][13] and Bhiksha (भिक्षा), which means alms.[14][15]
 Dāna has been defined in traditional texts as any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return.[16]
 While dāna is typically given to one person or family, Hinduism also discusses charity or giving aimed at public benefit, sometimes called utsarga. This aims at larger projects such as building a rest house, school, drinking water or irrigation well, planting trees, and building care facility among others.[17]
 The Rigveda has the earliest discussion of dāna in the Vedas.[18] The Rigveda relates it to satya ""truth"" and in another hymn points to the guilt one feels from not giving to those in need.[18] It uses da, the root of word dāna, in its hymns to refer to the act of giving to those in distress. Ralph T. H. Griffith, for example, translates Book 10, Hymn 117 of the Rig veda as follows:
 The Gods have not ordained hunger to be our death: even to the well-fed man comes death in varied shape,
The riches of the liberal never waste away, while he who will not give finds none to comfort him,
The man with food in store who, when the needy comes in miserable case begging for bread to eat,
Hardens his heart against him, when of old finds not one to comfort him.

Bounteous is he who gives unto the beggar who comes to him in want of food, and the feeble,
Success attends him in the shout of battle. He makes a friend of him in future troubles,
No friend is he who to his friend and comrade who comes imploring food, will offer nothing.

Let the rich satisfy the poor implorer, and bend his eye upon a longer pathway,
Riches come now to one, now to another, and like the wheels of cars are ever rolling,
The foolish man wins food with fruitless labour: that food – I speak the truth – shall be his ruin,
He feeds no trusty friend, no man to love him. All guilt is he who eats with no partaker.
 The Upanishads, composed before 500 BCE, present some of the earliest Upanishadic discussion of dāna. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, in verse 5.2.3, states that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (damah), compassion or love for all sentient life (daya), and charity (dāna).[20]
 तदेतत्त्रयँ शिक्षेद् दमं दानं दयामिति[21]
Learn three cardinal virtues - self restraint, charity and compassion for all life. Chandogya Upanishad, Book III, similarly, states that a virtuous life requires: tapas (asceticism), dāna (charity), arjava (straightforwardness), ahimsa (non-injury to all sentinent beings) and satyavacana (truthfulness).[20]
 Bhagavad Gita describes the right and wrong forms of dāna in verses 17.20 through 17.22.[23] It defines sāttvikam (good, enlightened, pure) charity, in verse 17.20, as one given without expectation of return, at the proper time and place, and to a worthy person. It defines rajas (passion, ego driven, active) charity, in verse 17.21, as one given with the expectation of some return, or with a desire for fruits and results, or grudgingly. It defines tamas (ignorant, dark, destructive) charity, in verse 17.22, as one given with contempt, to unworthy person(s), at a wrong place and time. In Book 17, Bhadwad Gita suggests steadiness in sattvikam dāna, or the good form of charity is better; and that tamas should be avoided.[2] These three psychological categories are referred to as the guṇas in Hindu philosophy.[24]
 The Adi Parva of the Hindu Epic Mahabharata, in Chapter 91, states that a person must first acquire wealth by honest means, then embark on charity; be hospitable to those who come to him; never inflict pain on any living being; and share a portion with others whatever he consumes.[25] In Chapter 87 of Adi Parva, it calls sweet speech and refusal to use harsh words or wrong others even if you have been wronged, as a form of charity. In the Vana Parva, Chapter 194, the Mahabharata recommends that one must, ""conquer the mean by charity, the untruthful by truth, the wicked by forgiveness, and dishonesty by honesty"".[26] Anushasana Parva in Chapter 58, recommends public projects as a form of dāna.[27] It discusses the building of drinking water tanks for people and cattle as a noble form of giving, as well as giving of lamps for lighting dark public spaces.[6] In later sections of Chapter 58, it describes planting public orchards, with trees that give fruits to strangers and shade to travelers, as meritorious acts of benevolent charity.[6] In Chapter 59 of Book 13 of the Mahabharata, Yudhishthira and Bhishma discuss the best and lasting gifts between people:
 An assurance unto all creatures with love and affection and abstention from every kind of injury, acts of kindness and favor done to a person in distress, whatever gifts are made without the giver's ever thinking of them as gifts made by him, constitute, O chief of Bharata's race, the highest and best of gifts (dāna). The Bhagavata Purana discusses when dāna is proper and when it is improper. In Book 8, Chapter 19, verse 36 it states that charity is inappropriate if it endangers and cripples modest livelihood of one's biological dependents or of one’s own. Charity from surplus income above that required for modest living is recommended in the Puranas.[29]
 Hindu scriptures exist in many Indian languages. For example, the Tirukkuṛaḷ, written between 200 BCE and 400 CE, is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It discusses charity, dedicating Chapter 23 of Book 1 on Virtues to it.[30] Tirukkuṛaḷ suggests charity is necessary for an virtuous life and happiness. He states in Chapter 23: ""Giving to the poor is true charity, all other giving expects some return""; ""Great, indeed, is the power to endure hunger.
Greater still is the power to relieve other's hunger""; ""Giving alms is a great reward in itself to one who gives"".[30][31] In Chapter 101, he states: ""Believing wealth is everything, yet giving away nothing, is a miserable state of mind""; ""Vast wealth can be a curse to one who neither enjoys it nor gives to the worthy"".[32] Like the Mahabharata, Tirukkuṛaḷ also extends the concept of charity to deeds (body), words (speech) and thoughts (mind). It states that a brightly beaming smile, the kindly light of loving eye, and saying pleasant words with sincere heart is a form of charity that every human being should strive to give.[33]
 Dāna is also used to refer to rituals. For example, in a Hindu wedding, kanyādāna (कन्यादान) refers to the ritual where a father gives his daughter's hand in marriage to the groom, after asking the groom to promise that he will never fail in his pursuit of dharma (moral and lawful life), artha (wealth) and kama (love). The groom promises to the bride's father, and repeats his promise three times in presence of all gathered as witness.[34][35]
 Other types of charity includes donating means of economic activity and food source. For example, godāna (donation of a cow),[36] bhudāna (भूदान) (donation of land), and vidyādāna or jñānadāna (विद्यादान, ज्ञानदान): Sharing knowledge and teaching skills, aushadhādāna (औषधदान): Charity of care for the sick and diseased, abhayadāna(अभयदान): giving freedom from fear (asylum, protection to someone facing imminent injury), and anna dāna (अन्नादान): Giving food to the poor, needy and all visitors.[37]
 Charity is held as a noble deed in Hinduism, to be done without expectation of any return from those who receive the charity.[16] Some texts reason, referring to the nature of social life, that charity is a form of good karma that affects one's future circumstances and environment, and that good charitable deeds leads to good future life because of the reciprocity principle.[16]
 Living creatures get influenced through dānam,
Enemies lose hostility through dānam,
A stranger may become a loved one through dānam,
Vices are killed by dānam.
 Other Hindu texts, such as Vyasa Samhita, state that reciprocity may be innate in human nature and social functions but dāna is a virtue in itself, as doing good lifts the nature of one who gives.[39] The texts do not recommend charity to unworthy recipients or where charity may harm or encourage injury to or by the recipient. Dāna, thus, is a dharmic act, requires idealistic-normative approach, and has spiritual and philosophical context.[16] The donor's intent and responsibility for diligence about the effect of dāna on the recipient is considered as important as the dāna itself. While the donor should not expect anything in return with dāna, the donor is expected to make an effort to determine the character of the recipient, likely return to the recipient and to the society.[16] Some medieval era authors state that dāna is best done with shraddha (faith), which is defined as being in good will, cheerful, welcoming the recipient of the charity and giving without anasuya (finding faults in the recipient).[40] These scholars of Hinduism, states Kohler, suggest that charity is most effective when it is done with delight, a sense of ""unquestioning hospitality"", where the dāna ignores the short term weaknesses as well as the circumstances of the recipient and takes a long term view.[40]
 Al-Biruni, the Persian historian, who visited and lived in India for 16 years from about 1017, mentions the practice of charity and almsgiving among Hindus as he observed during his stay. He wrote, ""It is obligatory with them (Hindus) every day to give alms as much as possible.""[7]
 After the taxes, there are different opinions on how to spend their income. Some destine one-ninth of it for alms.[41] Others divide this income (after taxes) into four portions. One fourth is destined for common expenses, the second for liberal works of a noble mind, the third for alms, and the fourth for being kept in reserve. Satrams, called Choultry, Dharamsala or Chathrams in parts of India, have been one expression of Hindu charity. Satrams are shelters (rest houses) for travelers and the poor, with many serving water and free food. These were usually established along the roads connecting major Hindu temple sites in South Asia as well as near major temples.[42][43][44]
 Hindu temples served as charitable institutions. Burton Stein[45] states that South Indian temples collected donations (melvarum) from devotees, during the Chola dynasty and Vijayanagara Empire periods in 1st millennium through first half of 2nd millennium AD.[46] These dāna were then used to feed people in distress as well as fund public projects such as irrigation and land reclamation.[45][47]
 Mitākṣarā by Vijñāneśvara is an 11th-century canonical discussion and commentary on dāna, composed under the patronage of Chalukya dynasty.[48] The discussion about charity is included in its thesis on ācāra (moral conduct).
 Major Sanskrit treatises that discuss ethics, methods and rationale for charity and alms giving in Hinduism include, states Maria Heim,[49] the 12th-century Dāna Kānda ""Book of Giving"" by Laksmidhara of Kannauj, the 12th-century Dāna Sāgara ""Sea of Giving"" by Ballālasena of Bengal, and the 14th-century sub-book Dānakhanda in Caturvargacintamani ""The Gem of the Four Aims of Human Life"" by Hemadiri of Devagiri (modern Daulatabad, Maharashtra). The first two are few hundred page treatises each, while the third is over a thousand-page compendium on charity, from a region that is now part of modern-day eastern Maharashtra and Telangana; the text influenced Hindus of Deccan region and South India from 14th to 19th centuries.[49]
 Dāna as a formal religious act is directed specifically to a monastic or spiritually-developed person. In Buddhist thought, it has the effect of purifying and transforming the mind of the giver.[50]
 Generosity developed through giving leads to experience of material wealth and possibly being reborn in happy states. In the Pāli Canon's Dighajanu Sutta, generosity (denoted there by the Pāli word cāga, which can be synonymous with dāna) is identified as one of the four traits conditioning happiness and wealth in the next life. Conversely, lack of giving leads to unhappy states and poverty.
 Dāna leads to one of the pāramitās or ""perfections"", the dānapāramitā. This can be characterized by unattached and unconditional generosity, giving and letting go.[citation needed]
 Buddhists believe that giving without seeking anything in return leads to greater spiritual wealth. Moreover, it reduces the acquisitive impulses that ultimately lead to continued suffering[51] from egotism.
 Dana is, as with Hindu texts like Mitaksara and Vahni Purana and in Buddhist texts, described as a virtue and duty in Jainism.[52] It is considered an act of compassion, and must be done with no desire for material gain.[53] Four types of Dana are discussed in the texts of Jainism: Ahara-dana (donation of food), Ausadha-dana (donation of medicine), Jnana-dana (donation of knowledge) and Abhaya-dana (giving of protection or freedom from fear, asylum to someone under threat).[53] Dāna is one of ten means to gain positive karma, in the soteriological theories of Jainism. Medieval era texts of Jainism dedicate a substantial portion of their discussions to the need and virtue of Dāna.[54]
 Dāna, called Vand Chhako, is considered one of three duties of Sikhs.[55] The duty entails sharing part of one's earnings with others, by giving to charity and caring for others. Examples of dāna in Sikhism include selfless service and langar.[56]"
Tithe	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe	"A tithe (/taɪð/; from Old English: teogoþa ""tenth"") is a one-tenth part of something, paid as a contribution to a religious organization or compulsory tax to government.[1] Today, tithes are normally voluntary and paid in cash or cheques, whereas historically tithes were required and paid in kind, such as agricultural products. Several European countries operate a formal process linked to the tax system allowing some churches to assess tithes.
 Traditional Jewish law and practice has included various forms of tithing since ancient times. Orthodox Jews commonly practice ma'aser kesafim (tithing 10% of their income to charity). In modern Israel, Jews continue to follow the laws of agricultural tithing, e.g., ma'aser rishon, terumat ma'aser, and ma'aser sheni. 
 With respect to Christianity, many denominations hold Jesus Christ taught that ""tithing must be done in conjunction with a deep concern for justice, mercy and faithfulness"" (cf. Matthew 23:23).[2][3][4] Tithing was taught at early Christian church councils, including the Council of Tours in 567, as well as the Third Council of Mâcon in 585. Tithing remains an important doctrine in many Christian denominations, such as the Congregationalist Churches, Methodist Churches and Seventh-day Adventist Church.[2]
 Some Christian Churches, such as those in the Methodist tradition, teach the concept of Storehouse Tithing, which emphasizes that tithes must be prioritized and given to the local church, before offerings can be made to apostolates or charities.[5][6]
 None of the extant extrabiblical laws of the Ancient Near East deal with tithing, although other secondary documents show that it was a widespread practice in the Ancient Near East.[7] William W. Hallo (1996[8]) recognises comparisons for Israel with its ancient Near Eastern environment, however, as regards tithes, comparisons with other ancient Near Eastern evidence is ambiguous,[9] and Ancient Near Eastern literature provides scant evidence for the practice of tithing and the collection of tithes.[10]
 Listed below are some specific instances of the Mesopotamian tithe, taken from The Assyrian Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, Vol. 4 ""E"" p. 369:[11]
 Hebrew is a Semitic language, related to Akkadian, the lingua franca of that time.[12]
 In Genesis 14:18–20, Abraham, after rescuing Lot, met with Melchizedek. After Melchizedek's blessing, Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he has obtained from battle:
 ""Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, and he blessed Abram, saying, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth. And praise be to God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.” In Genesis 28:16–22, Jacob, after his visionary dream of Jacob's Ladder and receiving a blessing from God, promises God a tenth:
 ""Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it.” And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”
So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God, and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you.” The tithe is specifically mentioned in the Books of Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. The tithe system was organized in a three-year cycle, corresponding to the Shemittah-cycle. These tithes were in reality more like taxes for the people of Israel and were mandatory, not optional giving. This tithe was distributed locally ""within thy gates"" (Deuteronomy 14:28) to support the Levites and assist the poor.
 Every year, Bikkurim, Terumah, Ma'aser Rishon and Terumat Ma'aser were separated from the grain, wine and oil (Deuteronomy 14:22). (As regards other fruit and produce, the Biblical requirement to tithe is a source of debate.) The first tithe is giving of one tenth of agricultural produce (after the giving of the standard terumah) to the Levite (or Aaronic priests). Historically, during the First Temple period, the first tithe was given to the Levites.  Approximately at the beginning of the Second Temple construction, Ezra and his Beth din implemented its giving to the kohanim.[13][14]
 Unlike other offerings which were restricted to consumption within the tabernacle, the second tithe could be consumed anywhere . On years one, two, four and five of the Shemittah-cycle, God commanded the Children of Israel to take a second tithe that was to be brought to the place of the Temple (Deuteronomy 14:23). The owner of the produce was to separate and bring 1/10 of his finished produce to the Old City of Jerusalem after separating Terumah and the first tithe, but if the family lived too far from Jerusalem, the tithe could be redeemed upon coins (Deuteronomy 14:24–25). Then, the Bible required the owner of the redeemed coins to spend the tithe ""to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish"" (Deuteronomy 14:26). Implicit in the commandment was an obligation to spend the coins on items meant for human consumption.
 In years three and six of the Shemittah-cycle the Israelites set aside the (second) tithe instead as the poor tithe, and it was given to the strangers, orphans, and widows.
 The Levites, also known as the Tribe of Levi, were descendants of Levi. They were assistants to the Aaronic priests (who were the children of Aaron and, therefore, a subset of the Tribe of Levi) and did not own or inherit a territorial patrimony (Numbers 18:21-28). Their function in society was that of temple functionaries, teachers and trusted civil servants who supervised the weights and scales and witnessed agreements. The goods donated from the other Israeli tribes were their source of sustenance. They received from ""all Israel"" a tithe of food or livestock for support, and in turn would set aside a tenth portion of that tithe (known as the Terumat hamaaser) for the Aaronic priests.
 An additional tithe mentioned in the Book of Leviticus (27:32–33) is the cattle tithe, which is to be sacrificed as a korban at the Temple in Jerusalem.
 LMLK seals may represent the oldest archaeological evidence of tithing. About 10 percent of the storage jars manufactured during Hezekiah's reign (circa 700 BC) were stamped (Grena, 2004, pp. 376–78). See 2 Chronicles 29–31 for a record of this early worship reformation.
 The Book of Nehemiah also talks about the collection of tithes to Leviim and distribution of Terumah to the priests: Nehemiah 13:5. People were actually appointed to collect mandatory tithes and place them in specially designated chambers which eventually came to be known as storehouses: Nehemiah 12:44.
 The Book of Malachi has one of the most quoted Biblical passages about tithing, directed to the sons of Jacob:
 For I, Jehovah, change not; therefore ye, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed. From the days of your fathers ye have turned aside from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return? ""Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In your tithes and contributions. You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you. Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need. I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the Lord of hosts. Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord of hosts."" The deuterocanonical Book of Tobit provides an example of all three classes of tithes practiced during the Babylonian captivity:
 I would often go by myself to Jerusalem on religious holidays, as the Law commanded for every Israelite for all time. I would hurry off to Jerusalem and take with me the early produce of my crops, a tenth of my flocks, and the first portion of the wool cut from my sheep. I would present these things at the altar to the priests, the descendants of Aaron. I would give the first tenth of my grain, wine, olive oil, pomegranates, figs, and other fruit to the Levites who served in Jerusalem. For six out of seven years, I also brought the cash equivalent of the second tenth of these crops to Jerusalem where I would spend it every year. I gave this to orphans and widows, and to Gentiles who had joined Israel. In the third year, when I brought and gave it to them, we would eat together according to the instruction recorded in Moses’ Law, as Deborah my grandmother had taught me... Orthodox Jews continue to follow the laws of Terumah and Ma'aser as well as the custom of tithing 10% of one's earnings to charity (ma'aser kesafim). Due to doubts concerning the status of persons claiming to be Kohanim or Levi'im arising after severe Roman/Christian persecutions and exile, the Hebrew Bible tithe of 10% for the Levites, and ""tithe of the tithe"" (Numbers 18:26) of 10% of 10% (1%) for the priests are dealt with in accordance with Jewish Law.[clarification needed] The Mishnah and Talmud contain analysis of the first tithe, second tithe and poor tithe.[15]
 Animals are not tithed in the present era when the Temple is not standing.[16]
 Jesus Christ taught that ""tithing must be done in conjunction with a deep concern for justice, mercy and faithfulness (Matthew 23:23)"".[2] Many of the ancient and historic Christian Churches, such as the Catholic Church and the Methodist Churches, practice tithing, as it was taught by the Council of Tours in 567, and in the Third Council of Mâcon in AD 585, a penalty of excommunication was prescribed for those who did not adhere to this ecclesiastical law.[17] Tithes can be given to the Church at once (as is the custom in many Christian countries with a church tax), or distributed throughout the year; during the part of Western Christian liturgies known as the offertory, people often place a portion of their tithes (sometimes along with additional offerings) in the collection plate.[18]
 2 Corinthians 9:7 talks about giving cheerfully, 2 Corinthians 8:12 encourages giving what you can afford, 1 Corinthians 16:1–2 discusses giving weekly (although this is a saved amount for Jerusalem), 1 Timothy 5:17–18 exhorts supporting the financial needs of Christian workers, Acts 11:29 promotes feeding the hungry wherever they may be and James 1:27 states that pure religion is to help widows and orphans.[2]
 According to a 2018 study by LifeWay Research that interviewed 1,010 Americans, 86% of people with Evangelical beliefs say that tithe is still a biblical commandment today.[19] In this number, 87% of Baptist believers, 86% of Pentecostal believers, 81% of Non-denominational believers share this position.
 The Seventh-day Adventist Church teaches in its Fundamental Beliefs that ""We acknowledge God's ownership by faithful service to Him and our fellow men, and by returning tithes and giving offerings for the proclamation of His gospel and the support of His Church.""[2]
 The Mennonite Church teaches that ""tithing as a minimum baseline is one of the principles on which financial giving in this 'first fruits' system is based"":[2]
 We depend on God's gracious gifts for food and clothing, for our salvation, and for life itself. We do not need to hold on tightly to money and possessions, but can share what God has given us. The practice of mutual aid is a part of sharing God's gifts so that no one in the family of faith will be without the necessities of life. Whether through community of goods or other forms of financial sharing, mutual aid continues the practice of Israel in giving special care to widows, orphans, aliens, and others in economic need (Deut. 24:17-22). Tithes and first-fruit offerings were also a part of this economic sharing (Deut. 26; compare Matt. 23:23).[2]
 The National Baptist Convention of America teaches that ""Baptists believe that a proper sense of stewardship begins with the 'tithe'; a presentation of which belongs to Him. 'The tithe is the Lord's.' We have not given as a result of presenting the tithe. Our giving begins with the offering {after we have tithed}.""[2]
 The Council of Trent, which was held after the Reformation, taught that ""tithes are due to God or to religion, and that it is sacrilegious to withhold them.""[20] Nowadays the Catholic Church no longer requires anyone to give ten percent of income. The Church simply asks Catholics to support the mission of their parish.[21] According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church ""The faithful also have the duty of providing for the material needs of the Church, each according to his own abilities""[22][23]
 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) bases its tithing on the following additional scriptures:[24]
 And this shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people. And after that, those who have thus been tithed shall pay one-tenth of all their interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever, for my holy priesthood, saith the Lord. And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes; yea, even our father Abraham paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he possessed. Tithing is currently defined by the church as payment to the church of one-tenth of one's annual income. Many LDS leaders have made statements in support of tithing.[25] Every Latter-day Saint receives an opportunity once a year to meet with their bishop about their tithing settlement. The payment of tithes is mandatory for members to receive the priesthood or obtain admission to temples.
 None of the funds collected from tithing is paid to church officials. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a Lay Ministry.[26] The money that is given is used to build and maintain church buildings as well as to further the work of the church.[27] Brigham Young University, a practically all-LDS school, also receives ""a significant portion"" of its maintenance and operational costs from LDS tithes.
 The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod teaches that ""Encourage[s] cheerful, first-fruit, proportionate (including but not limited to tithing) living and giving in all areas of life by Christian stewards"".[2]
 The Discipline of The Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, which teaches the doctrine of the Storehouse Tithing, holds:[5][28]  That all our people pay to God at least one-tenth of all their increase as a minimum financial obligation, and freewill offerings in addition as God has prospered them. The tenth is figured upon the tither's gross income in salary or net increase when operating a business.[28]
 The Book of Discipline  of the United Methodist Church states that it is the responsibility of ecclesiastics to ""educate the local church that tithing is the minimum goal of giving in The United Methodist Church.""[2]
 The Church of the Nazarene teaches Storehouse Tithing, in which members are asked to donate one-tenth of their income to their local church--this is to be prioritized before giving an offering to apostolates or charities.[29]
 The Moravian Church encourages its members to ""financially support the ministry of the Church toward the goal of tithing.""[2] It ""deem[s] it a sacred responsibility and genuine opportunity to be faithful stewards of all God has entrusted to us: our time, our talents, [and] our financial resources"".[2]
 Tithing in medieval Eastern Christianity did not spread so widely as in the West. A Constitution of the Emperors Leo I (reigned 457–474) and Anthemius (reigned 467–472) apparently expected believers to make voluntary payments and forbade compulsion.[30]
 The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America teaches ""proportionate giving and tithing as normal practices of Christian giving.""[2]
 The Pentecostal Church of God teaches that ""We recognize the scriptural duty of all our people, as well as ministers, to pay tithes as unto the Lord. Tithes should be used for the support of active ministry and for the propagation of the Gospel and the work of the Lord in general.""[2]
 The International Pentecostal Holiness Church likewise instructs the faithful that:[2]
 Our commitment to Jesus Christ includes stewardship. According to the Bible everything belongs to God. We are stewards of His resources. Our stewardship of possessions begins with the tithe. All our members are expected to return a tenth of all their income to the Lord.[2]
 The Book of Order of the Presbyterian Church (USA) states, with respect to the obligation to tithe:[31]
 “Giving has always been a mark of Christian commitment and discipleship. The ways in which a believer uses God’s gifts of material goods, personal abilities, and time should reflect a faithful response to God’s self-giving in Jesus Christ and Christ’s call to minister to and share with others in the world. Tithing is a primary expression of the Christian discipline of stewardship.”[31]
 The United Church of Christ, a denomination in the Congregationalist tradition, teaches that:[2]
 When we tithe we place God as our first priority. We trust in God's abundance instead of worrying about not having enough. Tithing churches live out a vision of abundance rather than a mentality of scarcity.[2]
 The right to receive tithes was granted to the English churches by King Ethelwulf in 855. The Saladin tithe was a royal tax, but assessed using ecclesiastical boundaries, in 1188. The legal validity of the tithe system was affirmed under the Statute of Westminster of 1285. The Dissolution of the Monasteries led to the transfer of many rights to tithe to secular landowners and the Crown – and tithes could be extinguished until 1577 under an Act of the 37th year of Henry VIII's reign.[32] Adam Smith criticized the system in The Wealth of Nations (1776), arguing that a fixed rent would encourage peasants to work far more efficiently.
 See below for a fuller description and history, until the reforms of the 19th century, written by Sir William Blackstone and edited by other learned lawyers of the period.
 The system gradually ended with the Tithe Commutation Act 1836, whose long-lasting Tithe Commission replaced them with a commutation payment, land award and/or rentcharges to those paying the commutation payment and took the opportunity to map out (apportion) residual chancel liability where the rectory had been appropriated during the medieval period by a religious house or college. Its records give a snapshot of land ownership in most parishes, the Tithe Files, are a socio-economic history resource. The rolled-up payment of several years' tithe would be divided between the tithe-owners as at the date of their extinction.[33]
 This commutation reduced problems to the ultimate payers by effectively folding tithes in with rents however, it could cause transitional money supply problems by raising the transaction demand for money. Later the decline of large landowners led tenants to become freeholders and again have to pay directly; this also led to renewed objections of principle by non-Anglicans.[34] It also kept intact a system of chancel repair liability affecting the minority of parishes where the rectory had been lay-appropriated. The precise land affected in such places hinged on the content of documents such as the content of deeds of merger and apportionment maps.[33]
 Rent charges in lieu of abolished English tithes paid by landowners were converted by a public outlay of money under the Tithe Act 1936 into annuities paid to the state through the Tithe Redemption Commission. Such payments were transferred in 1960 to the Board of Inland Revenue, and those remaining were terminated by the Finance Act 1977.
 The Tithe Act 1951 established the compulsory redemption of English tithes by landowners where the annual amounts payable were less than £1 so abolishing the bureaucracy and costs of collecting small sums of money.[citation needed]

 In France, the tithes – called ""la dîme"" – were a land tax. Originally a voluntary tax, the ""dîme"" became mandatory in 1585. In principle, unlike the taille, the ""dîme"" was levied on both noble and non-noble lands. The dîme was divided into a number of types, including the ""grosses dîmes"" (grains, wine, hay), ""menues"" or ""vertes dîmes"" (vegetables, poultry), ""dîmes de charnage"" (veal, lamb, pork). Although the term ""dîme"" comes from the Latin decima [pars] (""one tenth"", with the same origin as that of the U.S. coin, the dime), the ""dîme"" rarely reached this percentage and (on the whole) it was closer to 1/13th of the agricultural production.
 The ""dîme"" was originally meant to support the local parish, but by the 16th century many ""dîmes"" went directly to distant abbeys, monasteries, and bishops, leaving the local parish impoverished, and this contributed to general resentment. In the Middle Ages, some monasteries also offered the ""dîme"" in homage to local lords in exchange for their protection (see Feudalism) (these are called ""dîmes inféodées""), but this practice was forbidden by the Lateran Council of 1179.
 All religious taxes were constitutionally abolished in 1790, in the wake of the French Revolution.
 There has never been a separate church tax or mandatory tithe on Greek citizens. The state pays the salaries of the clergy of the established Church of Greece, in return for use of real estate, mainly forestry, owned by the church. The remainder of church income comes from voluntary, tax-deductible donations from the faithful. These are handled by each diocese independently.[citation needed]
 From the English Reformation in the 16th century, most Irish people chose to remain Roman Catholic and had by now to pay tithes valued at about 10 per cent of an area's agricultural produce, to maintain and fund the established state church, the Anglican Church of Ireland, to which only a small minority of the population converted. Irish Presbyterians and other minorities like the Quakers and Jews were in the same situation.
 The collection of tithes was resisted in the period 1831–36, known as the Tithe War. Thereafter, tithes were reduced and added to rents with the passing of the Tithe Commutation Act in 1836. With the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland by the Irish Church Act 1869, tithes were abolished.
 While the federal government has never collected a church tax or mandatory tithe on its citizens, states  collected a tithe into the early 19th century. The United States and its governmental subdivisions also exempt most churches from payment of income tax (under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state statutes, which also allows donors to claim the donations as an income tax itemized deduction). Also, churches may be permitted exemption from other state and local taxes such as sales and property taxes, either in whole or in part. Clergy, such as ministers and members of religious orders (who have taken a vow of poverty) may be exempt from federal self-employment tax on income from ministerial services. Income from non-ministerial services are taxable and churches are required to withhold Federal and state income tax from this non-exempt income. They are also required to withhold employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes under FICA, and pay the employer's share for the non-exempt income.[35]
 Both the tithe (diezmo), a levy of 10 per cent on all agricultural production, and ""first fruits"" (primicias), an additional harvest levy, were collected in Spain throughout the medieval and early modern periods for the support of local Catholic parishes.
 The tithe crossed the Atlantic with the Spanish Empire; however, the Indians who made up the vast majority of the population in colonial Spanish America were exempted from paying tithes on native crops such as corn and potatoes that they raised for their own subsistence. After some debate, Indians in colonial Spanish America were forced to pay tithes on their production of European agricultural products, including wheat, silk, cows, pigs, and sheep.
 The tithe was abolished in several Latin American countries, including Mexico, soon after independence from Spain (which started in 1810). The tithe was abolished in Spain itself in 1841, and in Argentina in 1826.
 In Austria a colloquially called church tax (Kirchensteuer, officially called Kirchenbeitrag, i. e. church contribution) has to be paid by members of the Catholic and Protestant Church[which?]. It is levied by the churches themselves and not by the government. The obligation to pay church tax can just be evaded by an official declaration to cease church membership. The tax is calculated on the basis of personal income. It amounts to about 1.1 per cent (Catholic church) and 1.5 per cent (Protestant church).[citation needed]
 All members of the Church of Denmark pay a church tax, which varies between municipalities.[36] The tax is generally around 1% of the taxable income.[citation needed]
 Members of state churches pay a church tax of between 1% and 2% of income, depending on the municipality. In addition, 2.55 per cent of corporate taxes are distributed to the state churches. Church taxes are integrated into the common national taxation system.[37]
 Germany levies a church tax, on all persons declaring themselves to be Christians, of roughly 8–9% of their income tax, which is effectively (very much depending on the social and financial situation) typically between 0.2% and 1.5% of the total income. The proceeds are shared among Catholic, Lutheran, and other Protestant Churches.[38]
 The church tax (Kirchensteuer) actually traces its roots back as far as the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803. It was reaffirmed in the Concordat of 1933 between Nazi Germany and the Catholic Church. Today its legal basis is article 140 of the Grundgesetz (the German ""constitution"") in connection with article 137 of the Weimar Constitution. These laws originally merely allowed the churches themselves to tax their members, but in Nazi Germany, collection of church taxes was transferred to the German government. As a result, both the German government and the employer are notified of the religious affiliation of every taxpayer. This system is still in effect today. Mandatory disclosure of religious affiliation to government agencies or employers constituted a violation of the original European data protection directives but is now permitted after the German government obtained an exemption.[38]
 Church tax (Kirchensteuer) is compulsory in Germany for those confessing members of a particular religious group. It is deducted at the PAYE level. The duty to pay this tax theoretically starts on the day one is christened. Anyone who wants to stop paying it has to declare in writing, at their local court of law (Amtsgericht) or registry office, that they are leaving the Church. They are then crossed off the Church registers and can no longer receive the sacraments, confession and certain services; a Roman Catholic church may deny such a person a burial plot.[38] In addition to the government, the taxpayer also must notify his employer of his religious affiliation (or lack thereof) in order to ensure proper tax withholding.[39]
 This opt-out is also used by members of ""free churches"" (e.g. Baptists) (non-affiliated to the scheme) to stop paying the church tax, from which the free churches do not benefit, in order to support their own church directly.
 Originally the Italian government of Benito Mussolini, under the Lateran treaties of 1929 with the Holy See, paid a monthly salary to Catholic clergymen. This salary was called the congrua. The eight per thousand law was created as a result of an agreement, in 1984, between the Italian Republic and the Holy See.
 Under this law Italian taxpayers are able to vote how to partition the 0.8% ('eight per thousand') of the total income tax IRPEF levied by Italy among some specific religious confessions or, alternatively, to a social assistance program run by the Italian State. This declaration is made on the IRPEF form. This vote is not compulsory; the whole amount levied by the IRPEF tax is distributed in proportion to explicit declarations.
 The last official statement of Italian Ministry of Finance made in respect of the year 2000 singles out seven beneficiaries: the Italian State, the Catholic Church, the Waldenses, the Jewish Communities, the Lutherans, the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Assemblies of God in Italy.
 The tax was divided up as follows:
 In 2000, the Catholic Church raised almost a billion euros, while the Italian State received about €100 million euros.
 In Scotland teinds were the tenths of certain produce of the land appropriated to the maintenance of the Church and clergy. At the Reformation most of the Church property was acquired by the Crown, nobles and landowners. In 1567 the Privy Council of Scotland provided that a third of the revenues of lands should be applied to paying the clergy of the reformed Church of Scotland. In 1925 the system was recast by statute[40] and provision was made for the standardisation of stipends at a fixed value in money. The Court of Session acted as the Teind Court. Teinds were finally abolished by section 56 of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000.
 Until the year 2000, Sweden had a mandatory church tax, to be paid if one did belong to the Church of Sweden, which had been funneling about $500 million annually to the church. Because of change in legislation, the tax was withdrawn in the year 2000. However, the Swedish government has agreed to continue collecting from individual taxpayers the annual payment that has always gone to the church. But now the tax will be an optional checkoff box on the tax return. The government will allocate the money collected to Catholic, Muslim, Jewish and other faiths as well as the Lutherans, with each taxpayer directing where his or her taxes should go.[citation needed]
 There is no official state church in Switzerland; however, all the 26 cantons (states) financially support at least one of the three traditional denominations — Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, or Protestant — with funds collected through taxation. Each canton has its own regulations regarding the relationship between church and state. In some cantons, the church tax (up to 2.3 per cent) is voluntary but in others an individual who chooses not to contribute to church tax may formally have to leave the church. In some cantons private companies are unable to avoid payment of the church tax.[citation needed]
 Excerpts from Sir William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England:
 . . . tithes; which are defined to be the tenth part of the increase, yearly arising and renewing from the profits of lands, the stock upon lands, and the personal industry of the inhabitants:
 ...
 
in general, tithes are to be paid for every thing that yields an annual increase, as corn, hay, fruit, cattle, poultry, and the like; but not for any thing that is of the substance of the earth, or is not of annual increase, as stone, lime, chalk, and the like; nor for creatures that are of a wild nature, or ferae naturae, as deer, hawks, &c, whose increase, so as to profit the owner, is not annual, but casual.[42]:24 We cannot precisely ascertain the time when tithes were first introduced into this country.  Possibly they were contemporary with the planting of Christianity among the Saxons, by Augustin the monk, about the end of the fifth century.  But the first mention of them, which I have met with in any written English law, is in a constitutional decree, made in a synod held A.D. 786, wherein the payment of tithes in general is strongly enjoined. This canon, or decree, which at first bound not the laity, was effectually confirmed by two kingdoms of the heptarchy, in their parliamentary conventions of estates, respectively consisting of the kings of Mercia and Northumberland, the bishops, dukes, senators, and people. Which was a few years later than the time that Charlemagne established the payment of them in France, and made that famous division of them into four parts ; one to maintain the edifice of the church, the second to support the poor, the third the bishop, and the fourth the parochial clergy.[42]:25 And upon their first introduction (as hath formerly been observed), though every man was obliged to pay tithes in general, yet he might give them to what priests he pleased; which were called arbitrary consecrations of tithes: or he might pay them into the hands of the bishop, who distributed among his diocesan clergy the revenues of the church, which were then in common. But, when dioceses were divided into parishes, the tithes of each parish were allotted to its own particular minister; first by common consent, or the appointment of lords of manors, and afterwards by the written law of the land.[42]:26
...It is now universally held, that tithes are due, of common right, to the parson of the parish, unless there be a special exemption. This parson of the parish, we have formerly seen, may be either the actual incumbent, or else the appropriator of the benefice: appropriations being a method of endowing monasteries, which seems to have been devised by the regular clergy, by way of substitution to arbitrary consecrations of tithes.[42]:28 We observed that tithes are due to the parson of common right, unless by special exemption: let us therefore see, thirdly, who may be exempted from the payment of tithes ... either in part or totally, first, by a real composition; or secondly, by custom or prescription.
 First, a real composition is when an agreement is made between the owner of the lands, and the parson or vicar, with the consent of the ordinary and the patron, that such lands shall for the future be discharged from payment of tithes, by reason of some land or other real recompence given to the parson, in lieu and satisfaction thereof.
 Secondly, a discharge by custom or prescription, is where time out of mind such persons or such lands have been, either partially or totally, discharged from the payment of tithes. And this immemorial usage is binding upon all parties, as it is in its nature an evidence of universal consent and acquiescence; and with reason supposes a real composition to have been formerly made. This custom or prescription is either de modo decimandi, or de non decimando.
 A modus decimandi, commonly called by the simple name of a modus only, is where there is by custom a particular manner of tithing allowed, different from the general law of taking tithes in kind, which are the actual tenth part of the annual increase. This is sometimes a pecuniary compensation, as twopence an acre for the tithe of land : sometimes it is a compensation in work and labour, as that the parson shall have only the twelfth cock of hay, and not the tenth, in consideration of the owner's making it for him: sometimes, in lieu of a large quantity of crude or imperfect tithe, the parson shall have a less quantity, when arrived to greater maturity, as a couple of fowls in lieu of tithe eggs ; and the like. Any means, in short, whereby the general law of tithing is altered, and a new method of taking them is introduced, is called a modus decimandi, or special manner of tithing.[42]:28–29
 A prescription de non decimando is a claim to be entirely discharged of tithes, and to pay no compensation in lieu of them.  Thus the king by his prerogative is discharged from all tithes. So a vicar shall pay no tithes to the rector, nor the rector to the vicar, for ecclesia decimas non folvit ecclesiae. But these personal to both the king and the clergy ; for their tenant or lessee shall pay tithes of the same land, though in their own occupation it is not tithable.  And, generally speaking, it is an established rule, that in lay hands, modus de non decimando non valet. But spiritual persons or corporations, as monasteries, abbots, bishops, and the like, were always capable of having their lands totally discharged of tithes, by various ways: as

 Zakāt (Arabic: زكاة [zækæːh]) or ""alms giving"", one of the Five Pillars of Islam, is the giving of a small percentage of one's assets to charity. It serves principally as the welfare contribution to poor and deprived Muslims, although others may have a rightful share. It is the duty of an Islamic state not just to collect zakat but to distribute it fairly as well.
 Zakat is payable on three kinds of assets: wealth, production, and animals. The more well-known zakat on wealth is 2.5 per cent of accumulated wealth, beyond one's personal needs. Production (agricultural, industrial, renting, etc.), is subject to a 10 per cent or 5 per cent zakat (also known as Ushur (عُشر), or ""one-tenth""), using the rule that if both labor and capital are involved, 5% rate is applied, if only one of the two are used for production, then the rate is 10 per cent. For any earnings, that require neither labor nor capital, like finding underground treasure, the rate is 20 per cent. The rules for zakat on animal holdings are specified by the type of animal group and tend to be fairly detailed.[43]
 Muslims fulfill this religious obligation by giving a fixed percentage of their surplus wealth. Zakat has been paired with such a high sense of righteousness that it is often placed on the same level of importance as performing the five-daily repetitive ritualised prayer (salat).[44] Muslims see this process also as a way of purifying themselves from their greed and selfishness and also safeguarding future business.[44] In addition, Zakat purifies the person who receives it because it saves him from the humiliation of begging and prevents him from envying the rich.[45] Because it holds such a high level of importance the ""punishment"" for not paying when able is very severe. In the 2nd edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam it states, ""...the prayers of those who do not pay zakat will not be accepted"".[44] This is because without Zakat a tremendous hardship is placed on the poor which otherwise would not be there. Besides the fear of their prayers not getting heard, those who are able should be practicing this third pillar of Islam because the Quran states that this is what believers should do.[46]
 Non-Muslims (able-bodied adult males of military age) living in an Islamic state are required to pay Jizya, this exempts them from military service and they do not pay Zakat.
 Ismaili Muslims pay tithes to their spiritual leader the Aga Khan, known by the Gujarati language term dasond, which in turn refers to one-eighth of the earned income of the community member.
 Daswandh (Punjabi: ਦਸਵੰਧ), sometimes spelled Dasvandh, is the one tenth part (or 10 per cent) of one's income that should be donated in the name of the God, according to Sikh principles.[47][48]"
Tzedakah	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzedakah	"Tzedakah [tsedaˈka] or  Ṣ'daqah [sˤəðaːˈqaː] in Classical Hebrew (Hebrew: .mw-parser-output .script-hebrew,.mw-parser-output .script-Hebr{font-size:1.15em;font-family:""Ezra SIL"",""Ezra SIL SR"",""Keter Aram Tsova"",""Taamey Ashkenaz"",""Taamey David CLM"",""Taamey Frank CLM"",""Frank Ruehl CLM"",""Keter YG"",""Shofar"",""David CLM"",""Hadasim CLM"",""Simple CLM"",""Nachlieli"",""SBL BibLit"",""SBL Hebrew"",Cardo,Alef,""Noto Serif Hebrew"",""Noto Sans Hebrew"",""David Libre"",David,""Times New Roman"",Gisha,Arial,FreeSerif,FreeSans}צדקה) (Arabic: الصدقة, romanized: aṣ-Ṣadaqa), is a Hebrew word literally meaning ""justice"" or ""righteousness"", but commonly used to signify charity.[1] Notably, this concept of ""charity"" is different from the modern Western understanding of ""charity"", which is typically understood as a spontaneous act of goodwill and a marker of generosity, as tzedakah is rather an ethical obligation.  In Judaism, tzedakah refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just, which Judaism emphasizes is an important part of living a spiritual life.  Thus, unlike voluntary philanthropy, tzedakah is seen as a religious obligation that must be performed regardless of one's financial standing, and is considered mandatory even for those of limited financial means. More broadly, tzedakah is considered to be one of the three main acts that can positively influence an unfavorable heavenly decree.
 The word tzedakah is based on the Hebrew (צדק, Tzedek) meaning righteousness, fairness or justice, and is related to the Hebrew word Tzadik, meaning righteous as an adjective (or righteous individual as a noun in the form of a substantive).  Although the word appears 157 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible, typically in relation to ""righteousness"" per se, its use as a term for ""charity"" in the above sense is an adaptation of Rabbinic Judaism in Talmudic times.
 In the Middle Ages, Maimonides conceived of an eight-level hierarchy of tzedakah, where the highest form is to give a gift, loan, or partnership that will result in the recipient becoming self-sufficient, instead of living upon others; in his view, the second highest form of tzedakah is to give donations anonymously to unknown recipients.[2]
 The Hebrew Bible teaches the obligation to aid those in need, but does not employ one single term for this obligation.[3] The term tzedekah occurs 157 times in the Masoretic Text, typically in relation to ""righteousness"" per se, usually in the singular, but sometimes in the plural tzedekot, in relation to acts of charity.[4][5] In the Septuagint this was sometimes translated as eleemosyne, ""almsgiving.""[6][7][5]
 In classical rabbinical literature, it was argued that the Biblical regulations concerning left-overs only applied to corn fields, orchards, and vineyards, and not to vegetable gardens; the classical rabbinical writers were much stricter in regard to who could receive the remains. It was stated that the farmer was not permitted to benefit from the gleanings, and was not permitted to discriminate among the poor, nor try to frighten them away with dogs or lions (Hullin 131a, Pe'ah 5:6)[8] the farmer was not even allowed to help one of the poor to gather the left-overs. However, it was also argued that the law was only applicable in Canaan, (Jerusalem Talmud. Pe'ah 2:5) although many classical rabbinical writers who were based in Babylon observed the laws there (Hullin 134b)[9] it was also seen as only applying to Jewish paupers, but poor non-Jews were allowed to benefit for the sake of civil peace.[10]
 Maimonides lists his Eight Levels of Giving, as written in the Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot matanot aniyim (""Laws about Giving to Poor People""), Chapter 10:7–14:
 In practice, most Jews carry out tzedakah by donating a portion of their income to charitable institutions, or to needy people that they may encounter; the perception among many modern-day Jews is that if donation of this form is not possible, the obligation of tzedakah still requires that something be given. Traditional Jews commonly practice ma'sar kesafim, tithing 10% of their income to support those in need.
 Special acts of tzedakah are performed on significant days; at weddings, Jewish brides and bridegrooms would traditionally give to charity, to symbolise the sacred character of the marriage; at Passover, a major holiday in Jewish tradition, it is traditional to be welcoming towards hungry strangers, and feed them at the table; at Purim it is considered obligatory for every Jew to give food to one other person, and gifts to at least two poor people,[11] in an amount that would equate to a meal each, for the purpose of increasing the total happiness during the month.
 As for the more limited form of tzedakah expressed in the biblical laws, namely the leaving of gleanings from certain crops, the Shulchan Aruch argues that during the exile Jewish farmers are not obliged to obey it.[12] Nevertheless, in modern Israel, rabbis of Orthodox Judaism insist that Jews allow gleanings to be consumed by the poor and by strangers, and all crops (not just gleanings) by anyone and everyone (free, not bought nor sold) during sabbatical years.[13]
 In addition, one must be very careful about how one gives out tzedakah money. It is not sufficient to just give to anyone or any organization, rather, one must check the credentials and finances to be sure that your tzedakah money will be used wisely, efficiently and effectively ""Do not steal from a poor person, for (s)he is poor,"" (Proverbs 22:22) and from Talmudic-era commentaries including Numbers Rabba 5:2. It is taught that tzedakah money was never yours to begin with; rather, it always belongs to God, who merely entrusts you with it so that you may use it properly. Hence it is your obligation to ensure that it is received by those deserving of it.
 There are many examples of tzedakah funds that operate according to Maimonides' principles above (particularly #2), including Hands on Tzedakah (working with nonprofits in the U.S. and in Israel), and Mitzvah Heroes Fund (working mainly with nonprofits in Israel). Paamonim is a nonprofit organization in Israel that operates according to Maimonides' first principle.
 Gaon of Vilna considered giving tzedakah to all householders in our city with tax-benefit.
 The primary counterpart in Islam is Zakat (Arabic: زكاة), as that refers to one's religious obligation based on those Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of wealth.[14]

Sadaqah	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadaqah	"Sadaqah or Sadqah (Arabic: صدقة, Urdu: صدقہ, IPA: [sˤɑdæqɐ],[n A] ""charity"", ""benevolence"",[1] plural ṣadaqāt صدقات)   in the modern context has come to signify ""voluntary charity"".[2] According to the Quran, the word means voluntary offering, whose amount is at the will of the ""benefactor"".[3]
 'Sadaqa' literally means 'righteousness' and refers to the voluntary giving of alms or charity.[4] But in Islamic terminology; Sadaqah has been defined as an act of ""Giving something to somebody without seeking a substitute in return and with the intention of pleasing Allah.""[5] Meanwhile, according to Ar-Rageeb al-Asfahaani “Sadaqa is what the person gives from what he possesses, like Zakat, hoping to get closer to Allah.""
 The term 'Sadaqah' stems from the Arabic root word ‘sidq’ (s-d-q) ص،د،ق, which means sincerity and It is considered as a sign of sincere faith.[6] The three-letter root of this word, S-D-Q, also means, ""to speak the truth,"" ""to be sincere,"" and ""to fulfill one's promise."" All of these aspects of honorable behavior indicate the links between generosity and a healthy society.[7] Some modern researchers also try to etymologically link the word sadaqa to the Hebrew .mw-parser-output .script-hebrew,.mw-parser-output .script-Hebr{font-size:1.15em;font-family:""Ezra SIL"",""Ezra SIL SR"",""Keter Aram Tsova"",""Taamey Ashkenaz"",""Taamey David CLM"",""Taamey Frank CLM"",""Frank Ruehl CLM"",""Keter YG"",""Shofar"",""David CLM"",""Hadasim CLM"",""Simple CLM"",""Nachlieli"",""SBL BibLit"",""SBL Hebrew"",Cardo,Alef,""Noto Serif Hebrew"",""Noto Sans Hebrew"",""David Libre"",David,""Times New Roman"",Gisha,Arial,FreeSerif,FreeSans}צדקה sedāḳā (almsgiving). Some experts hence conclude that sadaqa is a loanword.[8]
 There are many verses on Sadaqat (Charity), either voluntary or obligatory. Among whom are stated below: 
 According to some hadiths, ""a kind word and smile"" can be considered as sadaqa and the best form of it is ""passing on knowledge.""[1] Also, Muhammad said in a hadith that sadaqa removes seventy gates of evil.[18]
 According to Quran 9 verse 60, there are eight categories of people who are entitled to receive Sadaqah. They are :"

 Other Shia concepts of Aqidah
 Zakat (Arabic: زكاة zakāh [zaˈkaːh], ""that which purifies"",[1] also Zakat al-mal [zaˈkaːt alˈmaːl] زكاة المال, ""zakat on wealth"",[2] or Zakah)[3] is a form of alms-giving treated in Islam as a religious obligation or tax,[4][5] which, by Quranic ranking, is next after prayer (salat) in importance.[6]
 As one of the Five Pillars of Islam, zakat is a religious obligation for all Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of wealth.[7] It is a mandatory charitable contribution, often considered to be a tax.[8][9] The payment and disputes on zakat have played a major role in the history of Islam, notably during the Ridda wars.[10][11][page needed]
 Zakat is based on income and the value of all of one's possessions.[12][13] It is customarily 2.5% (or 1/40)[14] of a Muslim's total savings and wealth above a minimum amount known as nisab,[15] but Islamic scholars differ on how much  nisab is and other aspects of zakat.[15] According to Islamic doctrine, the collected amount should be paid to the poor, the needy, Zakat collectors, those sympathetic to Islam, to free from slavery, for debt relief, in the cause of Allah and to benefit the stranded traveller.
 Today, in most Muslim-majority countries, zakat contributions are voluntary, while in Libya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Yemen, zakat is mandated and collected by the state.[16][17]
 Shias, unlike Sunnis, traditionally regarded zakat as a private and voluntary decision, and they give zakat to imam-sponsored rather than state-sponsored collectors.[18][19][20]
 Zakat literally means ""that which purifies"".[1]
Zakat is considered a way to purify one's income and wealth from sometimes worldly, impure ways of acquisition.[1][21][22][23]
According to Sachiko Murata and William Chittick, ""Just as ablutions purify the body and salat purifies the soul (in Islam), so zakat purifies possessions and makes them pleasing to God.""[24][25]
 The Quran discusses charity in many verses, some of which relate to zakat. The word zakat, with the meaning used in Islam now, is found, for example, in suras: 7:156, 19:31, 19:55, 21:73, 23:4, 27:3, 30:39, 31:4 and 41:7.[26][27]
Zakat is found in the early Medinan suras and described as obligatory for Muslims.[25] It is given for the sake of salvation. Muslims believe those who give zakat can expect reward from God in the afterlife, while neglecting to give zakat can result in damnation. Zakat is considered part of the covenant between God and a Muslim.[25]
 Verse 2.177 (Picktall translation) sums up the Quranic view of charity and alms giving (Another name for Zakat is the ""Poor Due""):
 It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces to the East and the West; but righteous is he who believeth in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Scripture and the Prophets; and giveth his wealth, for love of Him, to kinsfolk and to orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and to those who ask, and to set slaves free; and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor due. And those who keep their treaty when they make one, and the patient in tribulation and adversity and time of stress. Such are they who are sincere. Such are the God fearing. - 2:177
 According to Yusuf al-Qaradawi, verse 9.5 of the Quran[28] makes zakat one of three prerequisites for pagans to become Muslims: ""but if they repent, establish prayers, and practice zakat they are your brethren in faith"".[7]
 The Quran also lists who should receive the benefits of zakat, discussed in more detail below.[29]
 Each of the most trusted hadith collections in Islam have a book dedicated to zakat. Sahih Bukhari's Book 24,[30] Sahih Muslim's Book 5,[31] and Sunan Abu-Dawud's Book 9[32] discuss various aspects of zakat, including who must pay, how much, when and what. The 2.5% rate is also mentioned in the hadiths.[33]
 The hadiths admonish those who do not give the zakat. According to the hadith, refusal to pay or mockery of those who pay zakat is a sign of hypocrisy, and God will not accept the prayers of such people.[34] The sunna also describes God's punishment for those who refuse or fail to pay zakat.[35] On the day of Judgment, those who did not give the zakat will be held accountable and punished.[29]
 The hadith contain advice on the state-authorized collection of the zakat. The collectors are required not to take more than what is due, and those who are paying the zakat are asked not to evade payment. The hadith also warn of punishment for those who take zakat when they are not eligible to receive it (see Distribution below).[29]
 The amount of zakat to be paid by an individual depends on the amount of money and the type of assets the individual possesses. The Quran does not provide specific guidelines on which types of wealth are taxable under the zakat, nor does it specify percentages to be given. But the customary practice is that the amount of zakat paid on capital assets (e.g. money) is 2.5% (1/40).[36] Zakat is additionally payable on agricultural goods, precious metals, minerals, and livestock at a rate varying between 2.5% and 20% (1/5), depending on the type of goods.[37][38]
 Zakat is usually payable on assets continuously owned over one lunar year that are in excess of the nisab, a minimum monetary value.[39] However, Islamic scholars have disagreed on this issue. For example, Abu Hanifa did not regard the nisab limit to be a pre-requisite for zakat, in the case of land crops, fruits and minerals.[40] Other differences between Islamic scholars on zakat and nisab are acknowledged as follows by Yusuf al-Qaradawi,[15]
 Unlike prayers, we observe that even the ratio, the exemption, the kinds of wealth that are zakatable are subject to differences among scholars. Such differences have serious implications for Muslims at large when it comes to their application of the Islamic obligation of zakat. For example, some scholars consider the wealth of children and insane individuals zakatable, others don't. Some scholars consider all agricultural products zakatable, others restrict zakat to specific kinds only. Some consider debts zakatable, others don't. Similar differences exist for business assets and women's jewelry. Some require certain minimum (nisab) for zakatability, some don't. etc. The same kind of differences also exist about the disbursement of zakat. – Shiekh Mahmud Shaltut[15] The consequence of failure to pay zakat has been a subject of extensive legal debate in traditional Islamic jurisprudence, particularly when a Muslim is willing to pay zakat but refuses to pay it to a certain group or the state.[42][43] According to classical jurists, if the collector is unjust in the collection of zakat but just in its distribution, the concealment of property from him is allowed.[42] If, on the other hand, the collector is just in the collection but unjust in the distribution, the concealment of property from him is an obligation (wajib).[42] Furthermore, if the zakat is concealed from a just collector because the property owner wanted to pay his zakat to the poor himself, they held that he should not be punished for it.[42] If collection of zakat by force was not possible, use of military force to extract it was seen as justified, as was done by Abu Bakr during the Ridda Wars, on the argument that refusing to submit to just orders is a form of treason.[42] However, Abu Hanifa, the founder of the Hanafi school, disapproved of fighting when the property owners undertake to distribute the zakat to the poor themselves.[42]
 Some classical jurists held the view that any Muslim who consciously refuses to pay zakat is an apostate, since the failure to believe that it is a religious duty (fard) is a form of unbelief (kufr), and should be killed.[44][45][46] However, prevailing opinion among classical jurists prescribed sanctions such as fines, imprisonment or corporal punishment.[42] Some classical and contemporary scholars such as Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh and Yusuf al-Qaradawi have stated that the person who fails to pay Zakat should have the payment taken from them, along with half of his wealth.[47][48] Additionally, those who failed to pay the zakat would face God's punishment in the afterlife on the day of Judgment.[29]
 In modern states where zakat payment is compulsory, failure to pay is regulated by state law similarly to tax evasion.[citation needed]
 According to the Quran's Surah Al-Tawba, there are eight categories of people (asnaf) who qualify to benefit from zakat funds.[49]
 Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the (funds); for those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Truth); for those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of Allah; and for the wayfarer: (thus is it) ordained by Allah, and Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom. Islamic scholars have traditionally interpreted this verse as identifying the following eight categories of Muslim causes to be the proper recipients of zakat:[51][52]
 Zakat should not be given to one's own parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, spouses or the descendants of the Prophet Muhammad.[57]
 Neither the Quran nor the Hadiths specify the relative division of zakat into the above eight categories.[58] According to the Reliance of the Traveller, the Shafi'i school requires zakat is to be distributed equally among the eight categories of recipients, while the Hanafi school permits zakat to be distributed to all the categories, some of them, or just one of them.[56]:h8.7 Classical schools of Islamic law, including Shafi'i, are unanimous that collectors of zakat are to be paid first, with the balance to be distributed equally amongst the remaining seven categories of recipients, even in cases where one group's need is more demanding.[59]
 Muslim scholars disagree whether zakat recipients can include non-Muslims. Islamic scholarship, historically, has taught that only Muslims can be recipients of zakat.[60] In recent times, some state that zakat may be paid to non-Muslims after the needs of Muslims have been met, finding nothing in the Quran or sunna to indicate that zakat should be paid to Muslims only.[57]
 Additionally, the zakat funds may be spent on the administration of a centralized zakat collection system.[36] Representatives of the Salafi movement include propagation of Islam and any struggle in righteous cause among permissible ways of spending, while others argue that zakat funds should be spent on social welfare and economic development projects, or science and technology education.[57] Some hold spending them for defense to be permissible if a Muslim country is under attack.[57] Also, it is forbidden to disburse zakat funds into investments instead of being given to one of the above eight categories of recipients.[citation needed]
 The zakat is considered by Muslims to be an act of piety through which one expresses concern for the well-being of fellow Muslims,[53] as well as preserving social harmony between the wealthy and the poor.[61] Zakat promotes a more equitable redistribution of wealth and fosters a sense of solidarity amongst members of the Ummah.[62]
 Zakat, an Islamic practice initiated by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, was first collected on the first day of Muharram.[63] It has played an important role throughout its history.[64] Schact suggests that the idea of zakat may have entered Islam from Judaism, with roots in the Hebrew and Aramaic word zakut.[25][65] However, some Islamic scholars[65] disagree that the Qur'anic verses on zakat (or zakah) have roots in Judaism.[66]
 The caliph Abu Bakr, believed by Sunni Muslims to be Muhammad's successor, was the first to institute a statutory zakat system.[67] Abu Bakr established the principle that the zakat must be paid to the legitimate representative of the Prophet's authority (i.e. himself).[64] Other Muslims disagreed and refused to pay zakat to Abu Bakr, leading to accusations of apostasy and, ultimately, the Ridda wars.[10][64][68]
 The second and third caliphs, Umar bin Al-Khattab and Usman ibn Affan, continued Abu Bakr's codification of the zakat.[64] Uthman also modified the zakat collection protocol by decreeing that only ""apparent"" wealth was taxable, which had the effect of limiting zakat to mostly being paid on agricultural land and produce.[69] During the reign of Ali ibn Abu Talib, the issue of zakat was tied to legitimacy of his government. After Ali, his supporters refused to pay zakat to Muawiyah I, as they did not recognize his legitimacy.[64]
 The practice of Islamic state-administered zakat was short-lived in Medina. During the reign of Umar bin Abdul Aziz (717–720 A.D.), it is reported that no one in Medina needed the zakat. After him, zakat came more to be considered as an individual responsibility.[64] This view changed over Islamic history. Sunni Muslims and rulers, for example, considered collection and disbursement of zakat as one of the functions of an Islamic state; this view has continued in modern Islamic countries.[70]
 Zakat is one of the five pillars of Islam, and in various Islamic polities of the past was expected to be paid by all practising Muslims who have the financial means (nisab).[71] In addition to their zakat obligations, Muslims were encouraged to make voluntary contributions (sadaqat).[72] The zakat was not collected from non-Muslims, although they were required to pay the jizyah tax.[73][74] Depending on the region, the dominant portion of zakat went typically to Amil (the zakat collectors) or Sabīlillāh (those fighting for religious cause, the caretaker of local mosque, or those working in the cause of God such as proselytizing non-Muslims to convert to Islam).[58][75]
 According to the researcher Russell Powell in 2010, zakat was mandatory by state law in Libya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Yemen. There were government-run voluntary zakat contribution programs in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Maldives and the United Arab Emirates.[76]
 Today, in most Muslim countries, zakat is at the discretion of Muslims over how and whether to pay, typically enforced by peer pressure, fear of God, and an individual's personal feelings.[16] Among the Sunni Muslims, The Zakat committees are established, linked to a religious cause or local mosque, which collect zakat.[77] Among the Shia Muslims, deputies on behalf of Imams collect the zakat.[78]
 In six of the 47 Muslim-majority countries—Libya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen—zakat is obligatory and collected by the state.[16][17][79][80] In Jordan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Bangladesh, the zakat is regulated by the state, but contributions are voluntary.[81]
 The states where zakat is compulsory differ in their definition of the base for zakat computation.[79] Zakat is generally levied on livestock (except in Pakistan) and agricultural produce, although the types of taxable livestock and produce differ from country to country.[79] Zakat is imposed on cash and precious metals in four countries with different methods of assessment.[79] Income is subject to zakat in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, while only Sudan imposes zakat on ""wealth that yields income"".[79] In Pakistan, property is exempt from the zakat calculation basis, and the compulsory zakat is primarily collected from the agriculture sector.[75]
 Under compulsory systems of zakat tax collection, such as Malaysia and Pakistan, evasion is very common and the alms tax is regressive.[16] A considerable number of Muslims accept their duty to pay zakat, but deny that the state has a right to levy it, and they may pay zakat voluntarily while evading official collection.[79] In discretion-based systems of collection, studies suggest zakat is collected from and paid only by a fraction of Muslim population who can pay.[16]
 In the United Kingdom, which has a Muslim minority, more than three out of ten Muslims gave to charity (Zakat being described as ""the Muslim practice of charitable donations""), according to a 2013 poll of 4000 people.[82] According to the self-reported poll, British Muslims, on average, gave US$567 to charity in 2013, compared to $412 for Jews, $308 for Protestants, $272 for Catholics and $177 for atheists.[82]
 The primary sources of sharia also do not specify to whom the zakat should be paid –  to zakat collectors claiming to represent one class of zakat beneficiary (for example, poor), collectors who were representing religious bodies, or collectors representing the Islamic state.[58][83] This has caused significant conflicts and allegations of zakat abuse within the Islamic community, both historically[58] and in modern times.[84]
 Fi Sabillillah is the most prominent asnaf in Southeast Asian Muslim societies, where it broadly construed to include funding missionary work, Quranic schools and anything else that serves the Islamic community (ummah) in general.[85]
 In 2012, Islamic financial analysts estimated annual zakat spending exceeded US$200 billion per year, which they estimated at 15 times global humanitarian aid contributions.[86][87] Islamic scholars and development workers state that much of this zakat practice is mismanaged, wasted or ineffective.[86] About a quarter of the Muslim world[88] continues to live on $1.25 a day or less, according to the 2012 report.[86]
 A 1999 study of Sudan and Pakistan, where zakat is mandated by the state, estimated that zakat proceeds ranged between 0.3 and 0.5 percent of GDP, while a more recent report put zakat proceeds in Malaysia at 0.1% of GDP.[79] These numbers are far below what was expected when the governments of these countries tried to Islamize their economies, and the collected amount is too small to have a sizeable macroeconomic effect.[79]
 In a 2014 study,[89] Nasim Shirazi states widespread poverty persists in Islamic world despite zakat collections every year. Over 70% of the Muslim population in most Muslim countries is impoverished and lives on less than US$2 per day. In over 10 Muslim-majority countries, over 50% of the population lived on less than $1.25 per day income, states Shiraz.[89] In Indonesia –  the world's most populous and predominantly Muslim country –  50% of Muslims live on less than $2 per day. This suggest large scale waste and mismanagement by those who collect and spend zakat funds. Given the widespread poverty among Muslim-majority countries, the impact of zakat in practice, despite the theoretical intent and its use for centuries, has been questioned by scholars.[90] Zakat has so far failed to relieve large scale absolute poverty among Muslims in most Muslim countries.[89]
 Zakat is required of Muslims only. For non-Muslims living in an Islamic state, sharia was historically seen as mandating jizya (poll tax).[91] Other forms of taxation on Muslims or non-Muslims, that have been used in Islamic history, include kharaj (land tax),[92] khums (tax on booty and loot seized from non-Muslims, sudden wealth),[93] ushur (tax at state border, sea port, and each city border on goods movement, customs),[94] kari (house tax)[95] and chari (sometimes called maara, pasture tax).[96][97]
 There are differences in the interpretation and scope of zakat and other related taxes in various sects of Islam. For example, khums is interpreted differently by Sunnis and Shi'ites, with Shia expected to pay one fifth of their excess income after expenses as khums, and Sunni don't.[98] At least a tenth part of zakat and khums every year, among Shi'ites, after its collection by Imam and his religious deputies under its doctrine of niyaba, goes as income for its hierarchical system of Shia clergy.[78][99] Among Ismaili sub-sect of Shias, the mandatory taxes which includes zakat, is called dasond, and 20% of the collected amount is set aside as income for the Imams.[100] Some branches of Shia Islam treat the right to lead as Imam and right to receive 20% of collected zakat and other alms as a hereditary right of its clergy.
 Sadaqah is another related term for charity, usually construed as a discretionary counterpart to zakat.[101]
 Zakat al-Fitr or Sadaqat al-Fitr[102] is another, smaller charitable obligation, mandatory for all Muslims — male or female, minor or adult as long as he/she has the means to do so — that is traditionally paid at the end of the fasting in the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.[103][104] The collected amount is used to pay the zakat collectors and to the poor Muslims so that they may be provided with a means to celebrate 'Eid al-Fitr (the festival of breaking the fast) following Ramadan, along with the rest of the Muslims.[105]
 Zakat al-Fitr is a fixed amount assessed per person, while Zakat al mal is based on personal income and property.[104] According to one source, the Hidaya Foundation, the suggested Zakat al Fitr donation is based on the price of 1 Saa (approx. 3 kg) of rice or wheat at local costs, (as of 2015, approximately $7.00 in the U.S.).[102]

Charity evaluators	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_evaluators	"Charity assessment is the process of analysis of the goodness of a non-profit organization in financial terms.[1] Historically, charity evaluators have focused on the question of how much contributed funds are used for the purpose(s) claimed by the charity, while more recently some evaluators have placed an emphasis on the cost effectiveness (or impact) of charities.[2]
 A charity watchdog is a type of nonprofit organization that provides ratings of charitable groups based on how an individual charity's money is spent, how it governs itself, and how the charity protects its donors' privacy, among other criteria.[3] Charity evaluation from these organizations has typically focused on measuring administrative and fundraising costs, salaries, and assessing how large of a proportion of a charity's budget is directly spent on impactful activities.
 In 2000, Ministry Watch, an evangelical Christian organization that reviews Protestant ministries for financial accountability and transparency, was founded. Charity Navigator was launched in 2001 by John P. Dugan, a wealthy pharmaceutical executive and philanthropist.[4] Initially, Charity Navigator provided financial ratings for 1,100 charities, and has data on 8,000 as of mid-2016.[5]
 The Toronto Star has reported on some of the difficulties and revelations of auditing charities as described by Charity Intelligence Canada (CIC). The authors call it ""concerning"", for example, that one in five of ""Canada's top 100 charities"" refused to release their full audited financial statements to CIC. Moreover, one quarter of the ""top 100 charities"" store at least 3 years worth of funding (that is, they have three times their annual budget in savings) and some store as much as 8 years worth. Of the ""top 100 charities"", 14% exceed the guidelines set by the Canada Revenue Agency by spending more than 35% of donations on fundraising – with some spending as much as 50% of donations on fundraising.[6]
 In 2015 the British government announced the creation of a new government-run watchdog to regulate large charities.[7]
 The United States of America has numerous of charity assessment websites such as GiveWell and the cited Charity Navigator[8] to monitor and update the public on the activities of a local and national nonprofit.
 In 2006, hedge fund employees Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld formed an informal group with colleagues to evaluate charities based on data and performance metrics similar to those they used at the fund. The group was surprised to find the data often didn't exist.[9] The next year, Karnofsky and Hassenfeld formed GiveWell as a nonprofit to provide financial analyst services to donors.[9][10]  They eventually decided to rate charities based on the metric of how much money it cost to save a life.[11][12]
 GiveWell has focused primarily on the cost-effectiveness of the organizations that it evaluates, rather than traditional metrics such as the percentage of the organization's budget that is spent on overhead.[13][14] In the first year, Karnofsky and Hassenfeld advocated that charities should generally spend more money on overhead, so that they could pay for staff and record keeping to track how effective their efforts were. This ran counter to standard ways of evaluating charities based on the ratio of overhead to funds deployed for the charity work itself.[10]
 Giving What We Can, founded in 2009 by Toby Ord, also differed from other charity evaluators in terms of the importance given to metrics of charity performance, solely focusing on the cost-effectiveness of the charity's work.[15][16] It has argued that the variance in cost-effectiveness of charities arises largely due to the variance in the nature of the causes that the charities operate in, and therefore has made evaluations across broad areas of work such as health, education, and emergency aid before comparing specific organizations.[17] In practice, it recommends a selected few charities in the area of global health. Its work is similar to that of GiveWell.[18] GWWC no longer evaluates charities but, like the National Philanthropic Trust, it accepts philanthropic members and helps them to donate to charities.
 Charity Navigator's CEO Ken Berger and consultant Robert M. Penna harshly criticized the idea of discriminating among cause areas for being moralistic and elitist ""by weighing causes and beneficiaries against one another"".[19] Philosopher and effective altruism advocate William MacAskill defended the concept by comparing the choice to donate to an art gallery with the choice of saving a painting rather than saving people from a burning building.[20]
 In 2013 and 2014, GuideStar, BBB Wise Giving Alliance, and Charity Navigator wrote open letters urging nonprofits and donors to end the use of the overhead ratio as the sole or main indicator of a nonprofit's performance.[21][22] Charity Navigator has also been working to expand its criteria to include results reporting. See Charity Navigator § Evaluation method.

Charity Navigator	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_Navigator	"Charity Navigator is a major[2] charity assessment organization that evaluates charitable organizations in the United States, operating as a free 501(c)(3) organization that accepts no advertising or donations from the organizations it evaluates.
 Charity Navigator was launched in spring 2001 by John P. (Pat) Dugan,[3] a wealthy pharmaceutical executive and philanthropist.[4] The group's mission was to help ""...donors make informed giving decisions and enabling well-run charities to demonstrate their commitment to proper stewardship"" of donor dollars.[5] Initially, Charity Navigator provided financial ratings for 1,100 charities, and has data on 8,500 as of mid-2017.[6]
 In 2011, Kiplinger's Personal Finance selected Charity Navigator as a Money Management Innovation for ""helping millions of people become philanthropists,""[7] and they on Time magazine's top 50 websites of 2006 list.[8]
 However, a 2014 Chronicle of Philanthropy interview on the non-profit sector by Nicholas Kristof identified them with a trend he deplored: ""There is too much emphasis on inputs and not enough on impact,"" Kristof said. ""This has been worsened by an effort to create more accountability through sites like Charity Navigator. There is so much emphasis now on expense ratios that there is an underinvestment in administration and efficiency.""[9]
 A 2014 survey of attitudes toward charity evaluation lauded Charity Navigator in  six of seven categories.[10]
 Using publicly available tax returns (IRS Form 990) filed with the Internal Revenue Service and information posted by charities on their web sites, the Charity Navigator rating system bases its evaluations in two broad areas—financial health and accountability/transparency.[11] Based on how the charity rates in each of the two areas, it is assigned an overall rating, ranging from zero to four stars. To help donors avoid becoming victims of mailing-list appeals, each assessment of a charity's performance is accompanied by a review of its commitment to keeping donors' personal information confidential.
 This method was criticized in an article in the Stanford Social Innovation Review for taking into account only a single year's IRS Form 990.[12] This can lead to significant fluctuation in the ranking of a charity from year to year.[12] Also, the focus on the IRS Form 990 has itself been criticized, as the accuracy and reliability of IRS Form 990 data is questionable.[12] Form 990 categorizes a charity's expenditures into three broad categories that are open to accounting manipulation. The nonprofit sector does not have the strict financial regulation and transparency required from public corporations (under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, among others), creating limitations on how accurately a charity's efficiency can be graded based on a tax return. Particularly relevant to Charity Navigator's methodology is that 59% of the 58,000 charities receiving public donations in 1999 failed to report any fundraising expenditures, illustrating a potential problem with relying on Form 990 figures alone when analyzing an organization.[12]
 It only rates the 6% of charity organizations in the United States that have over $1 million in annual revenue (these 6% get 94% of the revenues that come into the nonprofit sector each year),[13] and argues these charities have better expertise for reporting to the IRS, are under greater public scrutiny and therefore their reporting tends to be more accurate.
 As of December 2007, Charity Navigator would recommend donors support concerns that meet six criteria:[14]
 In December 2008, President and CEO Ken Berger[3] announced on his blog that the organization intends to expand its rating system to include measures of the outcomes of the work of charities it evaluates.[15] This was described in further detail in a podcast for The Chronicle of Philanthropy in September 2009. The article explained that plans for a revised rating system will also include measures of accountability (including transparency, governance and management practices) as well as outcomes (the results of the work of the charity).[16]
 In July 2010, Charity Navigator announced its first major revamp.[17] This revamping begins what the organization states is the process to move toward CN 3.0, which is a three-dimensional rating system that will include what they consider the critical elements to consider in making a wise charitable investment[18]
 After collecting data for more than a year, in September 2011 Charity Navigator launched CN 2.0, which is a two-dimensional rating system that rates a charity's (1) financial health and (2) accountability and transparency.[20]
 In January 2013, Charity Navigator announced another expansion to its rating methodology, ""Results Reporting: The Third Dimension of Intelligent Giving."" Because mission-related results are the very reason that charities exist, Charity Navigator developed this new rating dimension to specifically examine how well charities report on their results. 
 The new rankings now include ""various criteria, including ... privacy policies""[21] (to reduce being ""bombarded"" if donor information is sold).
 Charity Navigator's website explains the new methodology and its plans for the future.[19]
 In recent years, Charity Navigator has become outspoken against what it calls high CEO compensation. At the same time, they note that nonprofit CEOs should be paid what the market demands. They complete a CEO compensation study each year.[22] In the study, they have consistently argued that a low six-figure salary for a CEO of a mid-to-large sized nonprofit is the norm and should be acceptable to donors. They further argue that these are complex multimillion dollar operations that require a high level of expertise. They are however, outspoken against the phenomenon of million dollar plus compensation, which they do not believe is justified for a tax-exempt public charity.
 On its 2014 Form 990, Charity Navigator reported the salary of CEO Ken Berger as $160,644.[23]
 Charity Navigator compiles lists of charities that contract fundraising to corporate solicitors who retain more than 50% of the charity's budget. The charities were ""ranked by the percentage of their total functional expenses spent on professional fundraising fees."" The worst was the Disabled Police and Sheriff's Foundation which only kept 5.8% for its own programs and services. The rest of the donations, which represented 90.5 percent of the total collected went to the for-profit fundraisers. Both The Cancer Survivors' Fund, and The Association for Firefighters & Paramedics saw over 80 percent of donations retained by the corporate fundraisers.[24]
 Some charities, in response, began to supply more information. The New York Times reported in 2010 that one non-profit began ""reporting on its finances using the same format as the 10-K.""[3]
 A response to an article titled ""What Charity Navigator Gets Wrong About Effective Altruism""[25] was named
""The Elitist Philanthropy of so-called Effective Altruism""[26]"
CharityWatch	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CharityWatch	"CharityWatch, formerly known as the American Institute of Philanthropy (AIP), is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in Chicago,[1] created in the United States by Daniel Borochoff in 1992,[2] to provide information about charities' financial efficiency, accountability, governance, and fundraising.
 AIP analyzes charity financial documents to identify whether charities meet AIP's standards of financial efficiency, and publishes its findings.[3] AIP encourages donors to give to charities that will allocate most of their contributions to program services that benefit the people and to causes that donors wish to support. AIP also promotes charity accountability and transparency through its research on the rapidly changing nonprofit field.[4]
 AIP publishes the Charity Rating Guide & Watchdog Report, containing ratings of the financial efficiency of over 500 United States charities and charges an annual membership fee of $50 to access it. Non-members are able to access this information only for top-rated charities. The ratings are grades ranging from A+ (best) to F (worst) and are based on analysis of charities' financial documents.[5] The ratings include the percentage of a charity's budget that is spent on program services, how much it costs a charity to raise $100, an accountability measure, and the salaries of the charity's three highest-paid employees. The Guide also features articles about problems in the nonprofit field and tips to help donors make wise giving decisions and avoid charity scams.[6] AIP posts its top-rated charities on its website.[7]
 AIP also investigates ethical issues surrounding charity spending, including salaries and payouts, financial reporting, telemarketing and direct-mail solicitation campaigns, and governance. AIP shares the results of its research with the media and government agencies and works closely with these parties to educate the public about informed giving. AIP President Daniel Borochoff has testified before Congress about veterans charities,[8][9][10] the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita,[11] and the philanthropic response to the 9/11 attacks.[12]
 AIP's ratings have received exposure from Congress and the media; including AIP’s appearance on the front page of The Washington Post.[13][14][9][15]
 Charity Watch is governed by a five-person Board of Directors which includes its founder and president, Daniel Borochoff, who was paid $198,548 in 2017.[16] In 2018, Charity Watch spent $584,887, of which 54% ($316,695) was spent on salaries.[17] Charity Watch employs one analyst in addition to Mr. Borochoff.
 Charity Watch's stated goals are ""To research and evaluate the efficiency, accountability and governance of nonprofit organizations; to educate the public about the importance of wise giving; to inform the public of wasteful or unethical practices of nonprofits and provide recognition to highly effective and ethical charities; to advise AIP members and conduct special investigations and evaluations of nonprofits; to expand and re-define our programs periodically to meet the continuing challenge of keeping the contributor informed.""[18]
 AIP was criticized in a study on rating nonprofits for having a ""gotcha"" mentality and limited explanation for their ratings.[19] The study criticized nonprofit watchdog organizations for relying heavily on financial data that is not adequate for evaluating a nonprofit organization and may misguide the public, although the study noted that AIP ""recognizes the limitations of the [IRS Form] 990.""[19]
 Charity Watch discounts Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in its reporting of nonprofits' financials. Many in the nonprofit space have taken issue with this approach. [20][21][22]"
GiveWell	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiveWell	"GiveWell is an American non-profit charity assessment and effective altruism-focused organization. GiveWell focuses primarily on the cost-effectiveness of the organizations that it evaluates, rather than traditional metrics such as the percentage of the organization's budget that is spent on overhead.
 In 2006 Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld, who worked at a hedge fund in Connecticut, formed an informal group with colleagues to evaluate charities based on data and performance metrics similar to those they used at the fund, and were surprised to find the data often didn't exist.[2] The next year, Karnofsky and Hassenfeld formed GiveWell as a nonprofit to provide financial analyst services to donors.[2][3]  They eventually decided to rate charities based on the metric of how much money it cost to save a life.[4][5] In the first year, funding to run the nonprofit was provided by a fund called the Clear Fund into which the former members of informal club, now directors of GiveWell, had put around $300,000, with about half of that going to fund the organization.[6]
 In the first year, Karnofsky and Hassenfeld advocated that charities should generally spend more money on overhead, so that they could pay for staff and record keeping to track how effective their efforts were; this ran counter to standard ways of evaluating charities based on the ratio of overhead to funds deployed for the charity work itself.[3]
 In late 2007, GiveWell's founders promoted the organization on several internet blogs and forums using sockpuppets to ask questions about where to find good information about how to donate and then answering them, recommending GiveWell.[7] GiveWell's board of directors investigated and found that the founders Karnofsky and Hassenfeld had acted inappropriately and as a result, it fined each of them $5000 and Karnofsky was demoted from executive director to a program director.[7][8]
 In 2008, GiveWell received funding from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation's Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative. The Hewlett Foundation continued to be a major funder of GiveWell until March 2014, when the Hewlett Foundation announced that it was ending the Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative based on a 2010 study it commissioned that found that only 3% of donors selected charities based on performance metrics (rather than e.g. loyalty, personal connections, or faith), and a subsequent 2012 study showing that efforts to provide better data were not changing that pattern.[9]
 In 2013, GiveWell moved its offices to San Francisco where people in Silicon Valley had become strong supporters of the effective altruism philosophy.[2]
 Givewell's approach is data-driven, and they recommend charities which work in the developing world.[10]
 In 2011, Good Ventures, founded with $8.3 billion by husband and wife Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna, partnered with GiveWell to set up a partner organization called the Open Philanthropy Project, as a vehicle to direct the funding done by Good Ventures.[11][12] In 2015, Mike Krieger and his fiancee Kaitlyn Trigger pledged $750,000 to the Open Philanthropy Project over two years, with 10% going to fund the operations of the project.[13]
 Open Philanthropy project has investigated giving money to criminal justice reform[13] and a range of other policy areas,[14] and has funded work into mitigating risks of artificial intelligence,[15][16][17] biosecurity,[18] and global health.[19]
 In 2017, the Open Philanthropy Project separated from GiveWell, and upon Karnofsky stepping down as Co-Executive Director of GiveWell, Elie Hassenfeld became GiveWell's sole Executive Director. [20]"
Giving What We Can	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giving_What_We_Can	"Giving What We Can (GWWC) is an effective altruism associated organization whose members pledge to give 10% of their income to effective charities. It was founded at Oxford University in 2009 by the ethics researcher Toby Ord.
 Giving What We Can was founded as a giving society in 2009 by Toby Ord, an ethics researcher at Oxford, his wife Bernadette Young, a physician in training at the time, and fellow ethicist William MacAskill [2][3]
with the goal of encouraging people to give 10% of their income on a regular basis to alleviate world poverty.[4] This is similar to zakat[5] or tithing but Ord said there was no religious motivation behind it.[6] Ord cited writings from Peter Singer and Thomas Pogge about one's moral duty to give to the poor as inspiration for starting the organization,[7] and personally planned to give away everything above about $28,000 a year, the median after-tax salary in the U.K.[8] His focus was on effective giving, meaning that he emphasized donations to charities which saved a maximal amount of life per donation amount.[9]
GWWC was launched with 23 members.[8] People who joined signed a pledge to give away 10% of their income to any organization they thought could best address poverty in the developing world, and could pledge more; there was no penalty for quitting.[6] By the end of 2011 it had 177 members, mostly other academics, in five chapters including Oxford, Cambridge, Princeton, and Harvard.[8][10] By 2012 the group had 264 people from 17 countries,[11] and it surpassed 1,000 members in 2015.[2]
 By November 2011 the organization was providing its members regular reports on what charities were most effective at addressing poverty in the developing world,[8] and at that time was recommending a tropical diseases group and a de-worming group that each worked in Africa.[12] Ord relied in part on research conducted by GiveWell, and also used the concept of the QALY to gauge effectiveness of charities.[13]
 In 2011 a sister organization was spun off from Giving from What We Can at Oxford by MacAskill and others called ""High Impact Careers"" which encouraged people to pursue high-paying jobs so they could give more money away.[14]  Both organizations conducted outreach and recruiting at Oxford.[14][15][16] High Impact Careers was soon renamed to 80,000 Hours.[17] In 2012 the two organizations incorporated the Centre for Effective Altruism as a nonprofit to serve as an umbrella organization.[3][18]
 Giving What We Can conducts research to determine which charities it recommends for members and other people to support. It differs from other charity evaluators in terms of the importance given to metrics of charity performance. While evaluators such as Charity Navigator use the fraction of donations spent on program expenses versus administrative overhead as an important indicator, Giving What We Can solely focuses on the cost-effectiveness of the charity's work.[13][19] It believes that the variance in cost-effectiveness of charities arises largely due to the variance in the nature of the causes that the charities operate in, and therefore makes evaluations across broad areas of work such as health, education, and emergency aid before comparing specific organizations.[20] In practice, it recommends a selected few charities in the area of global health. Its work is therefore similar to that of GiveWell.[12]"
GuideStar	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GuideStar	"GuideStar USA, Inc. is an information service specializing in reporting on U.S. nonprofit companies.[2] In 2016, its database provided information on 2.5 million organizations.[3]
 GuideStar was one of the first central sources of information on U.S. nonprofits[4] and is the world's largest source of information about nonprofit organizations.[5]  GuideStar was founded in Williamsburg, Virginia in September 1994 and received tax-exempt status in 1996,[6] the same year the company began posting nonprofit organizations' financial reports to the World Wide Web.[7]
 GuideStar also serves to verify that a recipient organization is established and that donated funds go where the donor intended for individuals looking to give in the wake of disasters.[8]
 In 2013, GuideStar announced major changes to its GuideStar Exchange program, which allows nonprofits to supplement the public information that is available from the IRS.[9] GuideStar Nonprofit Profiles implemented three seals based on the information a nonprofit provides in its profile: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.[10] In 2016, a new seal that allowed nonprofits to share progress and results for their mission, GuideStar Platinum, was introduced.[11]
 In 2019, GuideStar merged with Foundation Center to form a new organization, Candid.[12]
 A charity watch investigator compared Charity Navigator, Charity Watch, Better Business Bureau, Combined Federal Campaign and Great Nonprofits. The investigator praised GuideStar for offering ""information rather than making judgments.""[66] After GuideStar placed a notice on the pages of some charities that were listed on the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) ""hate list,"" one of the groups sued GuideStar for defamation.[67][68] Other charities echoed criticism of GuideStar's use of SPLC's list.[69]"
Alternative giving	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_giving	"Alternative giving is a form of gift giving in which the giver makes a donation to a charitable organization on the gift recipient’s behalf, rather than giving them an item. The idea of giving something to one person by paying another was applied by Benjamin Franklin as a ""trick [...] for doing a deal of good with a little money"", which came to be known as ""pay it forward.""[1] This form of giving is often used as an alternative to consumerism and to mitigate the impact of gift-giving on the environment.[2]
 Charities that promote this type of donating will normally provide a card or certificate describing the donation, often with an example of how the donation will be used (such as one day’s worth of food for a hungry person) or a symbolic denomination, called ""ownership"" or ""adoption"" (of an animal or a tree for example). Some charities promote alternative giving at weddings in place of wedding favors, normally providing several cards to be left on tables at the reception letting guests know a donation has been made rather than individual cards for each guest. Kate Middleton and Prince William made the decision to ""Pay it Forward"" with their wedding gifts, asking that the money to be used for gifts be given to charities and good causes.[3]
 The concept was spoofed in the Seinfeld episode ""The Strike"". George Costanza, angry at having received a donation to charity instead of an actual gift, made up his own non-existent charity and handed out fake donations to save money on gifts and cheques.
 Comedian Ricky Gervais poked fun at the concept during a stand-up routine in which he recounts the time when his friends gave a goat to an African family in Gervais' name. Gervais considers this to be a lose-lose situation for all involved: he gets nothing, his friends spent a considerable amount of money on the alternative gift, the African family would not likely appreciate having ""another mouth to feed,"" and the goat being taken away from its natural environment to an unfamiliar place unsuited for it."

Social dance forms a large part of the evening; actual ballroom dancing may or may not occur.
 Elite formal dances in the Middle Ages often included elements of performance, which gradually increased until the 17th century, often reducing the amount of dancing by the whole company. Medieval dance featured many group dances, and this type of dance lasted throughout Baroque dance until at least the 19th century, when dances for couples finally took over the formal dance.  Group dances remained in some cases, and often dances for couples were danced in formation.  Many dances originated in popular forms, but were given elegant formalizations for the elite ball. Dancing lessons were considered essential for both sexes.
 As the ballets de cour at the French court, part social dance and part performance, declined in the later 17th century, the formal ball took over as a grand and large evening social event.  Although most were strictly by invitation only, with printed invitations coming in the mid-18th century, some balls were public, either with tickets sold, or in cases such as the celebration of royal events, open to anyone who was appropriately dressed.  It was at The Yew Tree Ball at Versailles in 1745, a public ball celebrating the royal wedding of his son, that Madame de Pompadour was able to meet the disguised King Louis XV, dressed as a hedge.[1]  The distinction between a less formal ""dance"" and a formal ""ball"" was established very early; improvised dancing after dinner, as occurs in Jane Austen's Persuasion (1818) was also common.[2]  In the 19th century the dance card became common; here ladies recorded the names of the men who had booked a particular dance with them.
 The grandest balls were at the French court in the Chateau de Versailles, with others in Paris. At royal balls, most guests did not expect to be able to dance, at least until very late in the night.[3]  Indeed, throughout the period dancers seem to have been a minority of the guests, and mostly drawn from the young and unmarried.  Many guests were happy to talk, eat, drink and watch. A bal blanc (""white ball"", as opposed to a bal en blanc, merely with an all-white theme) was or is only for unmarried girls and their chapereones, with the women all in white dresses.  The modern debutante ball may or may not continue these traditions. 
 A well-documented ball occurred at Kingston Lacy, Dorset, England, on 19 December 1791. The occasion was to celebrate the completion of major alterations to the house and the event was organised by Frances Bankes, wife of Henry Bankes, owner of the house. The event involved 140 guests, with dancing from 9pm to 7am, interrupted by supper at 1am.[4]  They would all have had dinner at home many hours earlier, before coming out.  Other, grander, balls served supper even later, up to 3.30 a.m., at an 1811 London ball given by the Duchess of Bedford.[5]
 The Duchess of Richmond's ball in Brussels in 1815, dramatically interrupted by news of Napoleon's advance, and most males having to leave to rejoin their units for the Battle of Waterloo the next day, has been described as ""the most famous ball in history"".[6]
 The word ball derives from the Latin word ballare, meaning 'to dance', and bal was used to describe a formal dancing party in French in the 12th century.  The ballo was an Italian Renaissance word for a type of elaborate court dance, and developed into one for the event at which it was performed. The word also covered performed pieces like Il ballo delle ingrate by Claudio Monteverdi (1608).  French developed the verb baller, and the noun bal for the event—from where it swapped into languages like English or German—, and bailar, the Spanish and Portuguese verbs for 'to dance' (although all three Romance languages also know danser, danzar, and dançar respectively). Catalan uses the same word, ball, for the dance event.  Ballet developed from the same root."
Benefit concert	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_concert	"A benefit concert or charity concert is a type of musical benefit performance (e.g., concert, show, or gala) featuring musicians, comedians, or other performers that is held for a charitable purpose, often directed at a specific and immediate humanitarian crisis.
 Benefit concerts can have both subjective and concrete objectives. Subjective objectives include raising awareness about an issue such as misery in Africa (such as Live 8) and uplifting a nation after a disaster (such as America: A Tribute to Heroes). Concrete objectives include raising funds (such as Live Aid) and influencing legislation (such as Live 8 or Farm Aid). The two largest benefit concerts of all time, in size, were the Live 8 and the Live Earth events, which both attracted billions of spectators.[1] Scholars theorize that the observed increase on concert size since the Live Aid is happening because organizers strive to make their events as big as the tragedy at hand, thus hoping to gain legitimization that way.[2]
 Examples exist in musical history of concerts being staged for philanthropic purposes. In 1749, the composer George Frideric Handel wrote his Foundling Hospital Anthem, and put on annual performances of Messiah, to support an orphans' charity in London.[3] While many composers and performers took part in concerts to raise donations for charitable causes, it was also not unusual in the 18th and 19th centuries for musicians to stage performances to raise funds for their own professional work, such as Ludwig van Beethoven's 1808 Akademie concert.[4][5]
 The modern understanding of a benefit concert is of a large-scale, popular event put on to support a charitable or political cause. In the modern era, the first benefit concert is generally held to be the Concert For Bangladesh, a programme of two events held at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1971, which were organized by George Harrison and Ravi Shankar.[6] However, the format of most modern concerts was established in 1985 by Bob Geldof's Live Aid event.[1]
 Benefit concerts are a major example of celebrity charity for they involve popular musicians; actors and actresses; and other kinds of entertainment figures volunteering to a greater cause. The efficiency of celebrity charity is explained by the theory of Catalytic Philantihropy designed by Paul Schervish. His thesis explains that it is more beneficial to a cause that celebrities do not contribute by only donating their money, but by participating in event like benefit concerts. That way stars can inspire hundreds of thousands of others to give.[7]
 The presence of celebrities can draw criticism, but that is outweighed by the benefits. Some argue that pop stars only take part in charity to improve their public image. That, arguably, may be a motivation, but their participation can be essential to the event's success. Celebrities not only promote catalytic philanthropy, they can produce an effect some call Geldofism: “The mobilization of pop stars and their fans behind a cause.”[8] Therefore, because of their visibility, celebrities are used by organizers as a mean to gain support to the cause in hand.
 Furthermore, the success of benefit concerts is tightly related to the quality of entertainment offered by them.[9] To gain space and legitimization in the media, benefit concerts must have a large audience, the kind of large crowd attracted by famous music stars. Bob Geldof himself responded to criticisms about the lack of African artists on the Live 8 by stating that, although those musicians produce great works, they do not sell many albums—and, for the sake of reaching as many people as possible, his concert had to include only popular artists.[10]
 Finally, the quality of entertainment is key to the creation of a public sphere where discussions about the concert's cause can occur. The better the entertainment, the more people watch the concert, and thus the more people become aware of the cause.[11] Furthermore, the music played in the concerts can lead spectators to interconnect and become more likely to act towards the cause. According to a theory, by Jane Bennett, when people sing in the presence of other people, and that happens in benefit concerts, they become connected to each other and are more likely to work together towards a goal.[12][13]
 Critics also say that benefit concerts are just a way for the rich West to forgive itself by helping the poor and distressed. These critiques argue that concerts like the Live Aid ""rob Africans of agency, reinforces Western ethnocentrism and racisms and see famine as a natural disaster rather than as a political issue"".[14]
 Benefit concerts are an effective form of gaining support and raising funds for a cause because of the large media coverage that they usually receive.[15] In addition to the results they generate themselves, benefit concerts also generate a kind of cascading effect. That is, larger benefit concert motivate smaller concerts and other kinds of charity initiatives.[2]
 Large-scale benefit concerts attract millions of viewers and are usually broadcast internationally. As powerful means of mass communication, they can be highly effective at raising funds and awareness for humanitarian causes. Media scholars Dayan and Katz classify benefit concerts as “media events”:  shared experiences that unite viewers with one another and their societies.[16] In fact, in their book Media Events: The Live Broadcasting of History, the authors suggest that the song synonymous with the Live Aid benefit concert, “We Are the World,"" might as well be the theme song for media events, as it nicely encompasses the tone of such occasions: “these ceremonies (media events) are so all-encompassing that there is nobody left to serve-as out-group”.[16]
 Dayan and Katz define media events as shared experiences that unite viewers and call their attention to a particular cause or occasion.[16] They argue that media events interrupt the flow people's daily lives, and that such events create a rise of interpersonal communication or “fellow feeling”.[16] Furthermore, they propose that media events transform the ordinary role of the viewer into something more interactive where they adhere to the script of the event.[16] All these principles of media events are true of benefit concerts. Benefit concerts interrupt the routine of people's lives because they occur (in most cases) for only for one night or for one week-end. Furthermore, they are broadcast as television spectacles that interrupt the regular scheduled programming on a given television network. Often, this kind of announced interruption has television viewers discussing the event with others beforehand, generating excitement around the event.[16] Moreover, benefit concerts encourage audiences to adhere to their script, such as by phoning in donations or signing an online pledge.
 As media events, benefit concerts are widely broadcast and seen by millions of people. (The Live Aid charity concert in 1985, for example, was seen by an estimated 1.5 billion viewers worldwide.)[17] However, this mass dissemination is only one of the factors that contribute to the success of benefit concerts. The people who send the message for collective action are essential to a benefit concert's effectiveness.
 Dayan and Katz suggest that media events are an expression of a “neo-romantic desire for heroic action”, meaning that media events produce leaders who inspire collective action with belief in the “power of the people” to change the world.[16] Benefit concerts, therefore, have the potential to raise enormous sums of money for a cause because of the para-social interaction that occurs between the performing celebrities (the leaders) and the spectating fans (the people).
 Dan Laughey describes para-social interaction as “the apparent familiarity between media personalities and audiences”.[18] Seeing a favourite celebrity support a cause can influence fans to support the same cause—not because the cause is significant to the fans, but because it seems significant to the artist. To feel connected to a celebrity, fans are likely to participate in activities the celebrity considers important. For example, if a benefit concert starred unknown musicians performing songs for unknown people in Africa, the incentive for viewers to donate would be minimal. Bob Geldof, the founder of Live Aid, is aware of the need of familiarity and para-social interaction on behalf of the viewer. When criticised for not inviting enough African performers to play at Live Aid (of which the main purpose was famine relief for Africa), Geldof commented that only popular musicians were invited to play at the show because unfamiliar artists would cause viewers to lose interest and “switch off”.[17] In seeing the familiar face of their beloved artist on stage endorsing a cause, fans feel more compelled to support the cause.
 Criticisms against benefit concerts go further than just criticizing the intentions of the celebrities involved. Some argue that benefit concerts are a wrong response for tragedies because the atmosphere involved on them is hardly one of mourning.[19] Further criticism comes from those who argue that Geldofism turns celebrities into the only legitimate spokespeople for a cause, robbing the NGOs of the possibilities to speak up for a cause.[20]
 In chronological order, beginning with the earliest date:
 The following is an incomplete list of benefit concerts with their own Wikipedia page. For a more descriptive and inclusive list focusing on historically notable events, see the list above. Note that while some of the listed concerts feature only one headliner and several supporting acts, other benefit concerts feature diverse lineups and are also considered music festivals. This list may have some overlap with list of free festivals, which are rock festivals that often have a social agenda or fund-raising focus."
Charity fraud	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_fraud	"Charity fraud is the act of using deception to get money from people who believe they are making donations to charities.  Often a person or a group of people will make material representations that they are a charity or part of a charity and ask prospective donors for contributions to the non-existent charity. Charity fraud not only includes fictitious charities but also deceitful business acts. Deceitful business acts include businesses accepting donations and not using the money for its intended purposes.
 There are controls and laws governing charities and businesses that accept donations. The Internal Revenue Service[3] (IRS) with the Better Business Bureau[4] (BBB) has regulations that can be found on their websites.
 The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) provides online information about avoiding charity fraud, such as fraudulent schemes that emerge in the wake of natural disasters, claiming to be providing disaster relief. The Internet Crime Complaint Center maintains a list of guidelines[5] to avoid charity fraud when making a donation.
 It is advised that people should follow certain guidelines when they donate and that they should consult a list such as the one on the BBB's website. This list includes the participants in the BBB Wise Giving Alliance's National Charity Seal Program. Participants have met standards for charity accountability and may, for a fee, display the seal logo on their websites as well as any other printed documents.[6]
 Charity fraud is distinguished from badge charity in which the charity does exist, but an inordinate percentage the funds donated are absorbed by professional fundraisers and operating expenses of the charity rather than the causes described in solicitations."
Charity / thrift / op shop	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_shop	"A charity shop, thrift shop or opportunity shop (colloquially referred to as an op shop) is a retail establishment run by a charitable organization to raise money. Charity shops are a type of social enterprise. They sell mainly used goods such as clothing, books, music albums, DVDs, and furniture donated by members of the public, and are often staffed by volunteers. Because the items for sale were obtained for free, and business costs are low, the items can be sold at competitive prices.  After costs are paid, all remaining income from the sales is used in accord with the organization's stated charitable purpose. Costs include purchase and/or depreciation of fixtures (clothing racks, bookshelves, counters, etc.), operating costs (maintenance, municipal service fees, electricity, heat, telephone, limited advertising) and the building lease or mortgage.
 Charity shops may also be referred to as thrift stores (in the United States and Canada), hospice shops, resale shops (a term that in the United States also covers consignment shops), and opportunity (or op) shops (in Australia and New Zealand).
 One of the earliest charity shops was set up by the Wolverhampton Society for the Blind (now called the Beacon Centre for the Blind) in 1899 to sell goods made by blind people to raise money for the Society.[1] During World War I, various fund-raising activities occurred, such as a bazaar in Shepherd Market, London, which made £50,000 for the Red Cross.
 However, it was during the Second World War that the charity shop became widespread. Edinburgh University Settlement opened their 'Thrift Shop for Everyone' on Nicholson Place, Edinburgh in 1937, the Red Cross opened up its first charity shop at 17 Old Bond Street, London in 1941. For the duration of the war, over two hundred “permanent” Red Cross gift shops and about 150 temporary Red Cross shops were opened. A condition of the shop licence issued by the Board of Trade was that all goods offered for sale were gifts. Purchase for re-sale was forbidden. The entire proceeds from sales had to be passed to the Duke of Gloucester’s Red Cross or the St John Fund. Most premises were lent free of rent and in some cases owners also met the costs of heating and lighting.
 The first Oxfam charity shop in the United Kingdom was established by Cecil Jackson-Cole in Broad Street, Oxford, and began trading in December 1947 (although the shop itself did not open until February 1948).
 Charity shops are often popular with people who are frugal. In the United States, shopping at a charity store has become popular enough to earn a slang term: thrifting. Environmentalists may prefer buying second-hand goods as this uses fewer natural resources and would usually do less damage to the environment than by buying new goods would, in part because the goods are usually collected locally.  In addition, reusing second-hand items is a form of recycling, and thus reduces the amount of waste going to landfill sites. People who oppose sweat shops often purchase second-hand clothing as an alternative to supporting clothing companies with dubious ethical practices.  People who desire authentic vintage clothing typically shop at thrift stores since most clothing that is donated is old and out of normal fashion, or is from a recently deceased person who had not updated his clothing for a long time. Shopping at thrift stores, or ""thrifting"", has become incredibly popular with young adults. It has become a trend on many YouTube channels to make ""thrifting"" videos. The young adults making these videos tend to shop at thrift stores more for the fashion than the prices.
 Second-hand goods are considered to be quite safe. The South Australian Public Health Directorate says that the health risk of buying used clothing is very low. It explains that washing purchased items in hot water is just one of several ways to eliminate the risk of contracting infectious diseases.[2]
 Some charity shops, such as the British Heart Foundation, also sell a range of new goods which may be branded to the charity, or have some connection with the cause the charity supports. Oxfam stores, for example, sell fair trade food and crafts.  Charity shops may receive overstock or obsolete goods from local for-profit businesses; the for-profit businesses benefit by taking a tax write-off and clearing unwanted goods from their store instead of throwing the goods out, which is costly.
 Oxfam has the largest number of charity shops in the UK with over 700 shops. Many Oxfam shops also sell books, and the organization now operates over 70 specialist Oxfam Bookshops, making them the largest retailer of second-hand books in the United Kingdom. Other Oxfam affiliates also have shops, such as Jersey, Germany, Ireland (45 shops in NI/ROI), the Netherlands and Hong Kong. Other charities with a strong presence on high streets in the UK include The Children's Society, YMCA, British Heart Foundation, Barnardos, Cancer Research UK, Shelter, Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, Age UK (formerly Age Concern and Help the Aged), Marie Curie Cancer Care, Norwood, Save the Children, Scope, PDSA, Naomi House Children's Hospice and Sue Ryder Care. Many local hospices also operate charity shops to raise funds.
 There are over 9,000 charity shops in the UK and Republic of Ireland. Their locations can be found on the Charity Retail Association (CRA) website,[3] along with information on charity retail, what shops can and can't accept, etc. The CRA is a member organisation for charities which run shops. British charity shops are mainly staffed by unpaid volunteers, with a paid shop manager. Goods for sale are predominantly from donations - 87% according to the official estimate.[4] Donations should be taken directly to a charity shop during opening hours, as goods left on the street may be stolen or damaged by passers-by or inclement weather. In expensive areas, donations include a proportion of good quality designer clothing and charity shops in these areas are sought out for cut-price fashions.[citation needed] 'Standard' charity shops sell a mix of clothing, books, toys, videos, DVDs, music (like CDs, cassette tapes and vinyl) and bric-a-brac (like cutlery and ornaments). Some shops specialise in certain areas, like vintage clothing, furniture, electrical items, or records.
 Almost all charity shops sell on their unsold textiles (i.e. unfashionable, stained or damaged fabric) to textile processors. Each charity shop saves an average of 40 tonnes of textiles every year, by selling them in the shop, or passing them on to these textile merchants for recycling or reuse. This grosses to around 363,000 tonnes across all charity shops in the UK; based on 2010 landfill tax value at £48 per tonne, the value of textiles reused or passed for recycling by charity shops in terms of savings in landfill tax is £17,424,000 p.a.[5] Gift Aid is a UK tax incentive for individual donors where, subject to a signed declaration being held by the charity, income tax paid on donations can be reclaimed by the charity. Although initially intended only for cash donations, the scheme now (since 2006) allows tax on the income earned by charity shops acting as agent for the donor to be reclaimed.[6]
 Charity shops in the UK get mandatory 80% relief on business rates on their premises, which is funded by central government (not by local ratepayers) and is one illustration of their support for the charity sector and the role of charity shops in raising funds for charities.[7] Charities can apply for discretionary relief on the remaining 20%, which is an occasional source of criticism from retailers which have to pay in full.[8]
 In Australia, major national opportunity shop chains include the St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store (trading as Vinnies) which operate 627 shops across Australia,[9] Anglicare Shops, that currently operate in 19 locations across Sydney and the Illawarra also various locations around Australia, the Salvation Army (trading as Salvos), the Red Cross, MS Australia, and the Brotherhood of St. Laurence. Many local charitable organisations, both religious and secular, run opportunity shops.  Common among these are missions and animal shelters.
 In the United States, major national charity thrift shop operators include  Goodwill Industries, Value Village/Savers, Salvation Army, St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store, and ReStore[10] (operated by Habitat for Humanity). Regional operators include Deseret Industries in the Western United States, and those run by Bethesda Lutheran Communities in the Upper Midwest.  Many local charitable organizations, both religious and secular, operate thrift stores.  Common among these are missions, children's homes, homeless shelters, and animal shelters. In addition, some charity shops are operated by churches as fundraising venues that support activities and missionary work."
Click-to-donate site	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-to-donate_site	"A click-to-donate site is a website where users can click a button to generate a donation for a charity or cause. These websites are otherwise known as fundraising platforms or crowdfunding platforms. The money for the donation comes from advertisers whose banners are displayed each time a user clicks the button. While not directly contributing (though many sites offer additional ways of support), visitors are making a difference in the sense that, had they not visited, no donation would have been given. 
 In most cases, the donation generated by each user only amounts to a few cents, but the goal is to accumulate enough clicks to add up to a significant amount.
 Many charities launched this style of program in the late 1990s. However, the constriction of online advertising spending around 2001 following the dot-com collapse caused many sites to be closed. Yet there are still many which are in operation notably FreeRice,[1] The Hunger Site and Feedeveryone.ml.[2]
 Flattr and CentUp uses click-to-donate technology on many sites instead of being centralized on just one.[3]"
Drive	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_(charity)	"In charitable organizations, a drive is a collection of items for people who need them, such as clothing, used items, books, canned food, cars, etc. Some drives are that people go through their inventory, bag the items up, and put them in a giveaway bin, or charitable organizations such as Big Brothers Big Sisters, The Salvation Army come to the house and pick them up. They then put the items in their thrift stores or, if they don't have any, sell them to thrift stores to raise money for their organization.
 A used clothing drive is philanthropic activity that requests clothing donations from community members or a network of individuals for the benefit of a non profit group or group of  vulnerable people. There are many benefits to organizing a used clothing drive. Used clothing drives divert waste from landfills by giving people an alternative disposal method for unwanted, ripped or stained items. Only 15% of textiles are recycled.[1] Nearly 95% of textiles worn or torn can be recycled.[2]
A used clothing drive can be a fundraising effort for organizations or groups that lack funding such as, Schools, Religious organizations, clubs, Sports Teams and Associations, neighborhoods and, communities.[3]
Donated Items can be given for free to the needy.
 The most popular ways to organize a used clothing drive are:
1. To collect clothing for donation directly to people in need of the specific items.
2. To collect clothing for sale to non profit organization who will use the resale profits to benefit established community charity initiatives for people who are struggling with addiction, in need of food or shelter, education programs and work experience programs. This method can also be used as a group fundraising effort.[4][5]
 There are many resources on the internet to help groups and clubs organize used clothing drives. These resources provide tips tools and ideas for generating interest and engagement to ensure successful outcomes."
Donor intent	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donor_intent	"In philanthropy, donor intent is the purpose, sometimes publicly expressed, for which a philanthropist intends a charitable gift or bequest. Donor intent is most often expressed in gift restrictions, terms, or agreements between a donor and donee, but it may also be expressed separately in the words, actions, beliefs, and giving practices of a philanthropist. Donor intent is protected in American law regarding charitable trusts, and trustees' primary fiduciary obligation is to carry out a donor's wishes.[1]
 Fidelity to donor intent is sometimes distinguished from grant compliance, and ""donor intent"" refers to the actions of a grantmaking entity and grant compliance refers to the actions of a grant recipient, but the term donor intent is commonly used to refer to both the guiding principles of a grantmaking entity and the purposes of a specific gift.[2]
 There have been many controversies, including litigation, over donor intent at private foundations, universities, and arts organizations.[3][4][5]
 Donor intent has been defended as a moral obligation between giver and recipient. Defenders of donor intent argue that on a basic ethical level, trustees and gift recipients must do what they have agreed with the original donor to do, explicitly or implicitly: ""When donor intent is violated, and particularly when it is egregiously violated, it undermines the bedrock trust on which all charitable giving rests.""[2]
 Donor intent is thus also defended as necessary to ensure future charitable giving.[2][6] Future donors might not be inclined to leave money to charitable causes if they see that trustees, grant recipients, or policymakers do not respect the stated intent. Peter Frumkin has written that ""as s a policy tool for encouraging future giving, protection of a donor's intent is needed to give future philanthropists the confidence they need to pass their wealth on to others to administer.""[1] Carl Schramm, former president of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, has said on donor intent, ""If we dont recognize it, we discourage wealthy people from creating foundations in the future.""[7]
 Survey data of Americans indicates that donor intent and grant compliance are valued by the public. When asked by Zogby if they would stop giving money to a charity that ignored a request to use a previous donation for a specific purpose, 53% said they would ""definitely stop giving"" and an additional 25.7% would ""probably stop giving."" When pollsters asked, ""How important do you think showing respect for a donor's wishes is to the ethical governance of nonprofit charitable organizations?,"" 82.9% considered it ""very important,"" 14.6% ""somewhat important.""[8]
 Finally, respect for donor intent is defended as necessary to preserve pluralism in civil society: ""Those who take the idea of donor intent seriously believe that only by protecting the idiosyncratic and at times outlandish ideas of donors will it be possible for philanthropy to innovate and pursue ideas that are either ahead of or behind their time,"" Frumkin has said.[6][9]
 Many arguments against donor intent are made against honoring it in perpetuity.[1][10] Such arguments date back at least to the 18th century and French economist Jacques Turgot: ""No work of man is made for immortality; and since foundations, always multiplied by vanity, would in the long run, if uninterfered with, absorb all funds and private properties, it would be absolutely necessary at last to destroy them.""[11]
 While not arguing against donor intent per se, Julius Rosenwald criticized philanthropic funds that are established in perpetuity, arguing that narrowly defined statements of donor intent can be superseded as situations change: "" I have heard of a fund which provides a baked potato at each meal for each young woman at Bryn Mawr, and of another, dating from one of the great families, which pays for half a loaf of bread deposited each day at the door of each student in one of the colleges of Oxford.... The list of these precisely focused gifts which have lost their usefulness could be extended into volumes.""[10]
 Another argument against donor intent relates to whether limitations may be placed on donors' purposes, either prudential or legal. In Evans v. Abney, the Supreme Court held that Augustus Octavius Bacon's clearly defined gift of a park to Macon, Georgia, for whites only was illegal under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and so the gift reverted to Bacon’s heirs. In cases that donor intent can be modified, courts have latitude to do that under cy pres doctrine. Finally, some critics of donor intent argue that it cements economic inequality.[12]
 Donor intent is considered virtually impossible to be maintained in perpetuity because of changing situations, erosion of capital, and the distance of successor trustees from a donor. In some instances, however, donor intent has been lost only a short time after a donor's death. Waldemar Nielsen has argued that the Carnegie Corporation of New York swiftly lost the ""democratic, hopeful, and constructive"" spirit of Andrew Carnegie's giving: ""That within five years of his death his Corporation should have turned into a racist and reactionary machine to defend the privileges of the old WASP elite and block the advancement of immigrants and the underprivileged deformed his spirit and intent.""[13] In the early 2000s, the Daniels Fund, established by Bill Daniels, drifted away from what Daniels' trustees considered to be his principles, and the drift was arrested by board action.[14][15]
 
Some donors have adopted strategies to prevent philanthropies that they create from drifting from donor intent.[2]
 Rosenwald cautioned donors against perpetuity: ""I am opposed to gifts in perpetuity for any purpose.""[10] Some donors have attempted to preserve their intent either by ""giving while living""[16] or by establishing a date or timeframe in the future by which a foundation must disburse its assets, or ""sunset."" Chuck Feeney founded the Atlantic Philanthropies, which is scheduled to spend down its assets by 2017. In 1975, inspired by the controversy over donor intent at the Ford Foundation, John M. Olin adopted plans for the John M. Olin Foundation to disburse its assets by 2005. Olin believed that capitalism was the basis of prosperity and sought to promote conservative political and legal thinking.[17] The spend-down plan gave the Olin Foundation the spending profile of a foundation with three times as many assets, Jeffrey Cain has written: ""The Olin Foundation made a deliberate decision to have a profound impact on its time, rather than a lighter one that spanned years into the future.""[2]
 Carnegie left the Carnegie Corporation's mission vague and open-ended by instructing his successors to ""promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding"" but also granting ""full authority to change policies or causes hitherto aided, from time to time, when this, in their opinion, has become necessary or desirable. They shall best conform to my wishes by using their own judgment.""[18] In creating the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, John D. MacArthur reportedly told his lawyer, ""I'll make [the money]. But you people, after I'm dead, will have to learn how to spend it.""[3]
 Other donors are much narrower. James B. Duke specified percentages of the annual payout that would go to various categories of giving by the Duke Endowment, including even a formula for reimbursing charity hospitals.[19] Today, some donors leave detailed documents to supplement official mission statements, including reflections on their principles, video statements, and records of their personal giving.[2]
 Often, donors select family members, personal business associates, lawyers, or nonprofit leaders to serve on their boards.[2] The Daniels Fund requires trustees to sign a statement affirming that they understand Bill Daniels' donor intent and will honor it in their decision-making on behalf of the foundation.[14] The foundation that was created by Lloyd Noble recruits apprentice trustees to shadow the actual board; some are elected to the board in the future.[2] At meetings of the Duke Endowment's board, James B. Duke's original indenture of trust is read aloud to reinforce his intentions.[19] The John Templeton Foundation has a provision for periodic ""donor intent audits"" to ensure its officers uphold John Templeton's purposes.[2]"
Earning to give	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earning_to_give	"Earning to give involves deliberately pursuing a high-earning career for the purpose of donating a significant portion of earned income, typically because of a belief in effective altruism.
 Advocates of earning to give sometimes suggest that maximizing the amount one can donate to charity is an important consideration for individuals when deciding what career to pursue, even if the individual has less intrinsic interest in high-earning careers.[1]
 In the 1996 book Living High and Letting Die, the philosopher Peter Unger wrote that it was morally praiseworthy and perhaps even morally required for people in academia who could earn substantially greater salaries in the business world to leave academia, earn the greater salaries, and donate most of the extra money to charity.[2] Moral philosopher Peter Singer has laid the foundations for effective altruism and earning to give in his 1971 essay ""Famine, Affluence and Morality"" and since advocated for donating considerable amounts of one's income to effective charitable organizations.[3] Singer is a public proponent of effective altruism and endorsed earning to give in his 2013 TED talk.[4] Associate Professor in Philosophy at Oxford University William MacAskill promoted earning to give as one possible high impact career in several news articles and in his 2015 book Doing Good Better: Effective Altruism and a Radical New Way to Make a Difference.[5][6] MacAskill is the co-founder and president of 80,000 Hours, a nonprofit which conducts research on careers with positive social impact and provides career advice.[7] The organization recommends earning to give as a career path with a high impact potential for effective altruists.[8][9]
 Many of the people who practice earning to give consider themselves to be part of the effective altruism community.[1][10][11] Some donate up to 50% of their income, more than the 10% required for the basic Giving What We Can pledge.[11][1] They may live frugally to donate more money.[11] Financial careers are popular for those pursuing earning to give.[10][1]
 David Brooks criticized the concept in his New York Times opinion column,[12] arguing that, while altruists may start doing ""earning to give"" to realize their deepest commitments, their values may erode over time, becoming progressively less altruistic. In addition, Brooks objected to the view on which altruists should turn themselves ""into a machine for the redistribution of wealth."" Peter Singer responded to these criticisms in his book The Most Good You Can Do by giving examples of people who have been earning to give for years without losing their altruistic motivation.[13] William MacAskill also defended the practice against Brooks' criticisms in The Washington Post, arguing that even Friedrich Engels was earning to give to support the work of anti-capitalist Karl Marx financially.[6] Dana Goldstein has also criticized earning to give, prompting a response from Reihan Salam.[14]
 Earning to give has been discussed in a number of news and media outlets including BBC News,[15] Quartz,[16] the Washington Post,[6][9] the New York Times,[12][17] The Atlantic,[18] The Guardian,[19] and Aeon Magazine.[20]"
Effective altruism	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism	"Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.[1] Effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact, based upon their values.[2] It is the broad, evidence-based and cause-neutral approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity.[3] Effective altruism is part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices.
 While a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector, the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects, companies, and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives, help people, or otherwise have the biggest benefit.[4] People associated with the movement include philosopher Peter Singer,[5] Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz,[6] Cari Tuna,[7] Ben Delo,[8] Oxford-based researchers William MacAskill[9] and Toby Ord,[10] professional poker player Liv Boeree,[11][12] and writer Jacy Reese.[13]
 Effective altruism differs from other philanthropic practices because of its emphasis on quantitatively comparing charitable causes and interventions with the goal of maximizing certain human values. In this way it is similar to consequentialism, which some leaders of the movement explicitly endorse.[2] The views of the philosopher Peter Singer in particular helped give rise to the effective altruist movement.[14] Singer's book The Life You Can Save argued for the basic philosophy of effective giving, claiming that people have a moral imperative to donate more because of the existence of extreme poverty. In the book, Singer argued that people should use charity evaluators to determine how to make their donations most effective. Singer personally gives a third of his income to charity.[15]
 Effective altruists reject the view that some lives are intrinsically more valuable than others. For example, they believe that a person in a developing country has equal value to a person in one's own community.[14] In the 1972 essay 'Famine, Affluence, and Morality', Peter Singer wrote:
 It makes no difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor's child ten yards away from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away. ... The moral point of view requires us to look beyond the interests of our own society. Previously ..., this may hardly have been feasible, but it is quite feasible now. From the moral point of view, the prevention of the starvation of millions of people outside our society must be considered at least as pressing as the upholding of property norms within our society.[16] In addition, many effective altruists think that future generations have equal moral value to currently existing people, and focus on reducing existential risks to humanity.[17] Others believe that the interests of non-human animals should be accorded the same moral weight as similar interests of humans and work to prevent the suffering of animals,[18] such as those raised in factory farms.[19]
 Although there is a growing emphasis on effectiveness and evidence among nonprofits, this is usually done with a single cause in mind, such as education or climate change. Effective altruists, however, seek to compare the relative importance of different causes and choose one objectively, a concept that is usually referred to as cause neutrality.[20][21][22][23] Effective altruists choose the highest priority causes based on whether activities in each cause area could efficiently advance broad goals, such as increasing human or animal welfare, and then focus their attention on interventions in high priority areas.
 Several organizations perform research into the relative prioritization of causes.[2][24][25] Some common priorities among effective altruists include poverty in the developing world, the suffering of animals in factory farms, and risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth.[4][20][22]
 Effective altruist organizations argue that some charities are far more effective than others, either because some do not achieve their goals or because of variability in the cost of achieving those goals.[26][27] When possible, they seek to identify charities that are highly cost-effective, meaning that they achieve a large benefit for a given amount of money.[9] For example, they select health interventions on the basis of their impact as measured by lives saved per dollar, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) saved per dollar, or disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted per dollar. This measure of disease burden is expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.
 Some effective altruism organizations use randomized controlled trials as a primary form of evidence,[9][18] as they are often considered to be at the highest level of strong evidence in healthcare research.[28]
 Effective altruists argue that counterfactual reasoning is important to determine which course of action maximizes positive impact. Many people assume that the best way to help people is through direct methods, such as working for a charity or providing social services,[29] but since charities and social-service providers usually can find people willing to work for them, effective altruists compare the amount of good somebody does in a conventional altruistic career to how much good would have been done had the next-best candidate been hired for the position. According to this reasoning, the impact of a career may be smaller than it appears.[30][31]
 Effective altruist organizations make philanthropic recommendations for charities on the basis of the impact from marginal funding rather than merely evaluating the average value of all donations to the charity.[32][33] Effective altruists avoid donating to organizations that have no ""room for more funding"" – those that face bottlenecks other than money which prevent them from spending the funds they have already accumulated or are expected to receive.[34] For example, a medical charity might not be able to hire enough doctors or nurses to distribute the medical supplies it is capable of purchasing, or it might already be serving all of the potential patients in its market. There are many other organizations which do have room for more funding, so giving to one of those instead would produce real-world improvements.
 Effective altruism encourages significant charitable donation. Some believe it is a moral duty to alleviate suffering through donations if the purchases that one forgoes to donate do not cause comparable suffering to oneself,[16] leading some of them to lead a frugal lifestyle in order to give substantially more than is typical in their society.[35] Advocacy focuses on increasing the amount that people donate or identifying nonprofits that best meet the criteria of effective altruism, in particular cost-effectiveness, transparency and strong evidence.[36]
 Giving What We Can (GWWC) is an organization which hosts a community of individuals who have pledged to donate at least 10% of their income for the remainder of their working lives to the causes that they believe are the most effective. GWWC was founded in 2009 by Toby Ord, a moral philosopher at Oxford University, who lives on £18,000 ($27,000) per year and donates the remainder of his income to charity.[37] As of 2019, more than 4,100 individuals have taken the pledge, who have collectively pledged to donate upwards of $1.5 billion over the course of their lifetimes.[38][39]
 The Founders Pledge is a similar system run by the nonprofit Founders Forum for Good where startup founders make a legally binding commitment to donate at least 2% of their personal proceeds to charity in the event that they sell their business.[40][41][42] By January 2019, three years after launch, more than 1400 entrepreneurs have pledged an estimated total value of $700 million based on the founders' equity and the companies' valuation and at least $91 million were raised.[43]
 Effective altruists argue that selection of one's career is an important determinant of the amount of good one does,[21] both directly (through the services one provides to the world) and indirectly (through the ways one directs the money earned based on the career).[44]
 80,000 Hours is an organisation in the effective altruism community that conducts research on the careers with high positive social impact and provides career advice.[45][46] It considers indirect methods of altruistic employment, such as earning a high salary in a conventional career and donating a portion of it, as well as direct practices, such as scientific research. It was co-founded by William MacAskill and Benjamin Todd.[47][48]
 Earning to give has been proposed as a possible strategy for effective altruists. This strategy involves choosing to work in high-paying careers with the explicit goal of donating large sums of money to charity.[49][50] William MacAskill argues that it might even be worth earning to give in morally controversial careers, since the marginal impact of taking an unethical job is small if someone else would have taken it regardless, while the counterfactual impact of the donations would be large.[44] However, 80,000 Hours have more recently argued that it's better to avoid careers that do significant direct harm, even if it seems like the negative consequences would be outweighed by donations. This is because there are often hidden harms in following unethical careers, and because they think it's important to take moral uncertainty into account.[51]
 David Brooks, a columnist for The New York Times, criticized earning to give. He wrote that most people who work in finance and other high-paying industries value money for selfish reasons and that being surrounded by these people will cause effective altruists to become less altruistic.[52] Peter Singer responded to these criticisms in his book The Most Good You Can Do by giving examples of people who have been earning to give for years without losing their altruistic motivation.[53] In The Week, Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry argued that the practice was ""unsettling"".[54]
 Effective altruism aspires to be cause-neutral, meaning it is in principle open to helping in whichever areas allow them to do the most good.[22][23][55] In practice, most people in the effective altruist movement have prioritized global poverty, animal welfare, and risks to the survival and flourishing of humanity and its descendants over the long-term future.[2][18][24][56]
 Global poverty alleviation has been a focus of some of the earliest and most prominent organizations associated with effective altruism.
 Charity evaluator GiveWell was founded by Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld in 2007 to address poverty and is part of the effective altruism community.[57][58] GiveWell has argued that the value of donations is greatest for international poverty alleviation and developing world health issues,[27][59] and its leading recommendations have been in these domains (including malaria prevention charities Against Malaria Foundation and Malaria Consortium, deworming charities Schistosomiasis Control Initiative and Deworm the World Initiative, and GiveDirectly for direct unconditional cash transfers).[60][61]
 The effective altruism organization The Life You Can Save, which originated from Peter Singer's book by the same name, also works to alleviate global poverty by promoting evidence-backed charities, conducting philanthropy education and changing the culture of giving in affluent countries.[62][63]
 While much of the initial focus of effective altruism was on direct strategies such as health interventions and cash transfers, there has also been interest in more systematic social, economic, and political reform that would facilitate larger long-term poverty reduction.[64] In 2011, GiveWell announced GiveWell Labs, which was later renamed as the Open Philanthropy Project, for research and philanthropic funding of more speculative and diverse causes such as policy reform, global catastrophic risk reduction and scientific research.[65][66] It is a collaboration between GiveWell and Good Ventures, a philanthropic foundation founded by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna.[67][68][69]
 Many effective altruists believe that reducing animal suffering should be a major priority and that, at the current margin, there are cost-effective ways of accomplishing this.[70][71] Peter Singer quotes estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the British organization Fishcount according to which 60 billion land animals are slaughtered and between 1 and 2.7 trillion individual fish are killed each year for human consumption.[72][73][74] He argues that effective animal welfare altruists should prioritize factory farming over more overfunded popular causes such as pet welfare.[15][19] Singer also argues that, if farm animals such as chickens are assigned even a modicum of consciousness, efforts to reduce factory farming (for example, by reducing global meat consumption) could be an even more underfunded and cost-effective way of reducing current global suffering than human poverty reduction.[75] Philosophically, wild animal suffering may be an additional moral concern for effective altruists.[76] In 2018, the book The End of Animal Farming by Jacy Reese discussed animal welfare issues from an effective altruism perspective, with a specific focus on the potential for cultured meat to address farm animal suffering and the importance of expanding the moral circle to help people care more about future beings, wild animals, bugs, and artificial sentience.[77]
 Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) is an effective altruism organization that evaluates and compares various animal charities based on their cost-effectiveness and transparency, particularly those that are tackling factory farming.[78][79][80] Faunalytics (formerly the Humane Research Council) is an organization loosely affiliated with the effective altruism community that conducts independent research on important animal welfare topics, provides resources for advocates and donors, and works with animal protection organizations to evaluate their work.[81][82] The Sentience Institute is a new effective altruism think tank founded in 2017 to address the expansion of the moral circle.[83]
 Focusing on the long-term future, some effective altruists believe that the total value of any meaningful metric (wealth, potential for suffering, potential for happiness, etc.) summed up over future generations, far exceeds the value for people living today.[2][84][85][86] In particular, the importance of addressing existential risks such as dangers associated with biotechnology and advanced artificial intelligence is often highlighted and the subject of active research.[87] Because it is often infeasible to use empirical science (such as randomized control trials) to measure the probability of an existential risk, researchers such as Nick Bostrom have used other methods such as expert opinion elicitation to estimate their importance.[88]
 Some organizations that work actively on research and advocacy for improving the long term future, and have connections with the effective altruism community, are the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge, and the Future of Life Institute.[89] In addition, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute is focused on the more narrow mission of aligning advanced artificial intelligence.[90][91]
 Many ideas behind effective altruism, such as consequentialism, have been present in practical ethics for a long time and have been reflected in the writings of philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham,[92] John Stuart Mill,[93] Peter Singer,[14] and Peter Unger. A basic argument for altruism was defined in Singer's 1972 paper ""Famine, Affluence, and Morality"", in which he argued that people have an obligation to help those in need:
 If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, then we ought, morally, to do it.[16] However, the movement identifying with the name ""effective altruism"" itself only came into being in the late 2000s[94] as a community formed around the groups Giving What We Can and GiveWell. It has since been growing in size.[93] The Internet forum LessWrong also played a role in the development of the movement.[95]
 Effective altruism conferences have been held since 2013.[96][97] In 2015, Peter Singer published The Most Good You Can Do, a book on effective altruism. The book describes the philosophy and social movement of effective altruism and argues in favor of it.[15] In the same year William MacAskill published his book Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help You Make a Difference which helped to further popularize the movement.[98][99][9] MacAskill also co-founded Giving What We Can and 80,000 Hours, both of which are part of the Centre for Effective Altruism.[92]
 In 2018, American news website Vox launched its Future Perfect section, publishing written pieces and podcasts that cover effective altruism ideas on the mission of ""Finding the best ways to do good"".[100][101] Vox's Future Perfect has since written extensively about core effective altruism topics such as effective philanthropy, high-impact career choice, poverty reduction, animal welfare improvements, and ways to reduce global catastrophic risks.[102][45][103][78][104]
 David Brooks has questioned whether children in distant countries should be treated as having equal moral value to nearby children. He claims that morality should be ""internally ennobling"".[52] In the Stanford Social Innovation Review, Ken Berger and Robert Penna of Charity Navigator condemned effective altruism's practice of ""weighing causes and beneficiaries against one another"", calling this ""moralistic, in the worst sense of the word"".[105]
 Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry warns about the ""measurement problem"", stating that some areas, such as medical research, or helping to reform third-world governance ""one grinding step at a time"", are hard to measure with controlled cost-effectiveness experiments and therefore risk being undervalued by the effective altruism movement.[54] Jennifer Rubenstein also hypothesizes that effective altruism can be biased against causes that are not straightforward to measure.[93]
 In Jacobin magazine, Mathew Snow argued that effective altruism ""implores individuals to use their money to procure necessities for those who desperately need them, but says nothing about the system that determines how those necessities are produced and distributed in the first place"".[106] Various critics have similarly objected to effective altruism on the basis of the fact that its proponents tend not to support political causes such as anti-capitalism that change ""the existing global institutional order"".[107] Joshua Kissel has replied that anti-capitalism is compatible with effective altruism in theory, while adding that effective altruists and anti-capitalists have reason to be more sympathetic to each other.[55] Brian Berkey has also argued that support for changing institutions such as capitalism does not contradict the principles of effective altruism, because effective altruism is open to any action that will have the greatest positive impact on the world, including the possibility of changing the existing global institutional order.[107] Elizabeth Ashton argues that we are separately obligated to donate to effective aid charities and to reform the structures that are responsible for poverty.[108]"
wealthiest	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_charitable_foundations	"This is a list of wealthiest charitable foundations worldwide.  It consists of the 40 largest charitable foundations, private foundations engaged in philanthropy, and other charitable organizations that have disclosed their assets.  In many countries such disclosure is not legally required, and often not done.
 Only nonprofit foundations are included in this list. Organisations that are part of a larger company are excluded, such as holding companies.
 The entries are ordered by the size of the organisation's financial endowment (that is, the value of assets net of liabilities, or invested donations). The endowment value is an estimate measured in United States dollars, based on the exchange rates on December 31, 2016[1]. Due to fluctuations in holdings, currency exchange and asset values, this list only represents the valuation of each foundation on a single day."
Master of Nonprofit Organizations	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Nonprofit_Organizations	"The Master of Nonprofit Organizations (MNO or MNPO), Master of Non-profit Management (MNM), Master of Not-for-Profit Leadership (MNPL), Master of Nonprofit Studies (MNpS), Master of Public Affairs (MPA), Master of Philanthropic Studies, Master of Nonprofit Administration (MNA) and similarly named degrees offer graduate-level training in management and leadership in the nonprofit sector.
 As evidenced by the lack of a uniform name, degrees in nonprofit management are a relatively new phenomenon. While some universities have established centers for nonprofit studies, such as the Mandel Center for Nonprofit Organizations at Case Western Reserve University, the Institute for Nonprofit Organizations at the University of Georgia, the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, and the ASU Lodestar Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Innovation at Arizona State University, most nonprofit management programs are within schools of social work, public administration, or management. However, as the field has grown, there are increasing numbers of free-standing graduate and undergraduate programs not bound within traditional disciplines. The Nonprofit Academic Centers Council (NACC) has developed curricular guidelines for degree programs in the nonprofit and philanthropic studies field that has helped to guide many universities in the development of their degree and certificate programs.[1] In 1983, the School of Management at the University of San Francisco was the first institution in the nation to offer the Master of Nonprofit Administration (MNA) program.[2]
 A typical nonprofit Master's program would require coursework in most or all of the following subjects:
 Program structures include traditional resident graduate programs, part-time programs for working professionals, and correspondence or online programs. In addition, many universities offering master's degrees also offer graduate certificates for students pursuing a graduate degree in another discipline."
Matching funds	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_funds	"Matching funds are funds that are set to be paid in equal amount to funds available from other sources.  Matching fund payments usually arise in situations of charity or public good. The terms cost sharing, in-kind, and matching can be used interchangeably but refer to different types of donations.[1]
 In philanthropic giving, foundations and corporations often give money to non-profit entities in the form of a matching gift.[2] Corporate matches often take the form of employee matching gifts, which means that if an employee donates to a nonprofit, the employee's corporation will donate money to the same nonprofit according to a predetermined match ratio (usually 1:1). For foundations, matching gifts are in the form of grants made directly to nonprofits if that the nonprofit raises a set quantity of money before the grant is bestowed. The benefit of foundation matching grants is that they provide greater incentive leverage when a nonprofit is fundraising from its constituency. If a foundation approves a 1:1 matching grant, donors know that their dollars will be doubled. On the other side, foundations who give matching grants receive assurance of the nonprofit's capacity to raise adequate funds.
 For example, Dr. Booker T. Washington, a famous African-American educator, had a long-time friendship with millionaire industrialist Henry H. Rogers, who provided him with substantial amounts of money to be applied for the betterment and education of black Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
 Washington later wrote that Rogers had encouraged projects with at least partial matching funds so that two ends were accomplished: 
 Using the matching funds philosophy, after Rogers's death, Julius Rosenwald and the Rosenwald Fund continued and expanded the work, eventually funding over 5,000 Rosenwald Schools between 1912 and 1932. During that time, over US$4.6 million additional dollars were contributed by blacks in the communities to respond to the challenge thus presented.
 In 1954, the General Electrics Foundation created the Corporate Alumni Program to match donations to the colleges and universities that employees graduated from.  This eventually broadened to other charities.  [3]  The foundation is one of the most generous with a $25,000 match per employee or retiree. [4]
 Some companies facilitate the process, allowing employers to match the gifts of their employees.[5] A matching gift, typically a one-time charitable gift made by an employee and matched by the employer, should not be confused with an employer matching program, which has to do with the employee's 401(k) plan and retirement.
 In 2014, corporations donated $17.8 Billion to nonprofit organizations. This is a 13.7% increase over 2013 corporate giving levels. In 2010, matching gifts represented ~20% of corporate cash donations.  [6] In 2016, over 65% of Fortune 500 companies offer an employee matching gift program. [7]
 In the UK, the not-for-profit organisation, the Big Give, have used match funding to raise over £97m for thousands of different charitable projects. The match funding is provided by a network of philanthropists and funders, called 'Champions'. Research commissioned by the Big Give shows that more people give when donations are matched (84% of surveyed respondents said they would be more likely to give if donation was matched) and people give more (one in three donors said they would give more than they usually would if do). [8]
 In the United States, many projects in the various states and communities are partially funded with federal grants with a requirement for matching funds. For example, the Interstate Highway System was primarily built with a mix of 90% FHWA funds from the Highway Trust Fund and 10% matching state DOT funds. In some cases, borrowed money may be used to meet criteria for a matching grant; the $550 million Canadian federal government investment to connect a Detroit River International Crossing to Interstate 75 in Michigan qualifies the state for US$2 billion in US federal matching grants that can rebuild other Michigan highways even though the Canadian money is nominally a loan, to be repaid by tolls on the new bridge.[9]
 US federal matching grants have also funded historic preservation initiatives; a local historic property may be able to seek a 1:1 federal matching grant for specific capital projects, such as restoration of structures on the National Register of Historic Places.[10]
 In American politics, the term refers to the money a presidential candidate is given by federal government to match the money they have raised personally. Candidates can expect up to US$250 extra from public funds for each contribution from an individual they receive.[11]
 That usually applies to the two main parties; as in order for a candidate to gain the benefits of matching funds, they must raise $5,000 from 20 states during the primaries or have received 5% of the popular vote in the general election.[11] Pat Buchanan, running as the Reform Party candidate in 2000, received matching funds despite winning only 0.4% of the vote.
 The source of the funds comes from a $3 voluntary checkoff on the US Income tax form. The program was established by the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act. The law also ""established overall spending limits for eligibility to receive matching funds, and provided for public funding of major party candidates in the general election for president"".[12]
 The effect that these have on the candidates for presidential campaigns is to strengthen the role that the party plays in raising money.
 Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party (United States) candidate for president, qualified for federal matching funds in the 2012 US presidential election.[13] Later, on June 30, 2012, Green Party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, also received enough contributions to qualify.[citation needed]
 On July 15, 2016, ALL Party presidential candidate, Alberto Cedeno, intentionally received no contributions to avoid qualifying for federal matching funds.[citation needed]
 Prior to a 2011 Supreme Court decision, states like Arizona, Maine, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Wisconsin were using a system that distributed ""additional funding to publicly financed candidates when they face big-spending opponents or opposition groups"".[14] The combined cases, Arizona Free Enterprise Fund v. Bennett (2011) and McComish v. Bennett (2011) held that ""the law impermissibly forces private candidates and independent political organizations to either restrain their spending or risk triggering matching funds to their publicly financed opponents"".[14]
 Now, states and cities are considering the implementation of programs like New York City's public financing model; public funds are used to multiply the impact of a small donor. The program is administered by the New York City Campaign Finance Board, which has avoided partisan divisions.[15] The programs work by making each contribution worth more than their current value, thereby increasing the proportional impact of the contribution.[16] In New York City, for example, a $6-to-$1 program has resulted in ""small dollar donors constitute the vast majority of spending in New York City elections, representing 73% of all contributions in 2013 and 80% specifically to City Council race"".[17] A report by the Brennan Center found that ""by pumping up the value of small contributions, the New York City system gives [candidates] an incentive to reach out to their own constituents rather than focusing all their attention on wealthy out-of-district donors, leading them to attract more diverse donors into the political process"".[18]
 Programs of this type incentivize candidates to ""fuse fundraising with voter outreach"" and incentivize political engagement by communities that can afford only modest contributions. Candidates may then have more an incentive to reach out to their constituents rather than devoting their energy to financing their campaigns.[16] The Election Law Journal found that matching funds through a multiplier has increased the proportional role of small donors as well as the number of small donors. The programs have also helped to shift the demographic and class profile of those who give. Finally, besides diluting the power of major givers, these programs led candidates to reach out and engage a more representative set of constituents during fundraising.[19]
 There is some dispute regarding the impact of matching funds programs like the one implemented in New York City. For example, ""after implementing the public matching funds program in NYC, [the] most recent mayoral election of 2009 witnessed the lowest voter turnout it's had since the 1960's"".[20]
 Others argue that the matching funds system benefits candidates with higher name recognition, especially if they are tied to a measure of popular support.[12] Some have suggested that public funding actually has a negative effect on the perceptions the public has of the government, perhaps because public funding programs do not meet ""the expectations set by reformers"".[21]"
Telethon	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telethon	"A telethon (a portmanteau of ""television"" and ""marathon"") is a televised fundraising event that lasts many hours or even days, the purpose of which is to raise money for a charitable, political or other purportedly worthy cause.
 Most telethons feature heavy solicitations for pledges (promises to donate funds at a later time) combined with variety show style entertainment. The equivalent term for a radio broadcast is a radiothon; most radiothons do not include the entertainment.
 In 1949, Milton Berle hosted the first ever telethon, raising $1,100,000 for the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation over the course of 16 hours.[1][2] The first published appearance of the word ""telethon"" was in the following day's newspapers.
 One of the first continuing annual telethons in the United States was the United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) telethon. Television executive Leonard Goldenson and his wife had a daughter with cerebral palsy, and with the help of other affected parents, launched the UCP Telethon in 1950, with early television personality Dennis James as host. He continued to host New York-based segments on the telethon through the 1980s. The telethon is now defunct as UCP raises funds through other means, including its website. By 1955 televised telethons had become a familiar enough part of American culture to be parodied that year in the film noir Tight Spot as comic relief.
 The oldest continuing annual telethon in the United States on the same channel is Green Bay, Wisconsin station WBAY-TV (channel 2)'s local Cerebral Palsy telethon, which helps provide financial support for equipment for Cerebral Palsy, Inc., that began broadcasting as a 22-hour event on the first weekend of March 1954. As of 2016, WBAY has presented the telethon for 62 years.
 Close behind the Green Bay telethon in longevity is the WHAS Crusade for Children in Louisville, Kentucky, which was first broadcast in October 1954 on WHAS-TV (channel 11) and WHAS radio (840 AM), six months after the first WBAY telethon. While the Crusade for Children is still broadcast on the two WHAS stations despite being owned by different entities for three decades, it has expanded to radio and television stations in other parts of Kentucky and Indiana, as well as a live stream on the internet. The Crusade is famous for the legions of firefighters who collect money at road blocks at intersections throughout the area each May and June. The Crusade annually collects more than $5 million in donations for a variety of child-related charities and causes, and remains the most successful local telethon in the United States. The Crusade returns 100 percent of all donations to organizations in all 120 Kentucky counties and more than 50 southern Indiana counties.
 The most-broadcast telethon to date was the January 22, 2010 Hope for Haiti Now telethon, to aid the victims of the January 10th earthquake. It offered the possibility for viewers to text donations on cell phones, and raised a reported $58 million by the next day. This event reflects a particular relationship between humanitarianism and entertainment that has developed in response to specific historical and economic market conditions. The increasing scope of social outreach efforts conducted online and through social media platforms facilitates the performance of moral responsibility implied by the claim of the telethon's narrative and visual strategies. This fundraising project was designed according to a formulaic pattern that relies on a form of nationalist identification that can be achieved and reinforced in viewers through the functional logic of the spectatorial relationship, that of a stark divide between the viewer and the people surviving a catastrophic event, which is reproduced in the telethon's representational structure.[3][4]
 In the United States, telethons are held for various Charitable organizations; as of 2012, however, no national telethons currently exist. The longest-running national telethon in the United States was the Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon, which was staged for over 21 hours each Labor Day to benefit the Muscular Dystrophy Association between 1966 and 2010. Over a three-year period from 2011 to 2013, the telecast was trimmed down to six hours, then to three, and then to two hours, by this point no longer serving as a telethon in the traditional sense and effectively becoming a pre-recorded benefit concert; from 2012 to 2014, the event had been renamed the MDA Show of Strength (founder Jerry Lewis also departed the organization on less than amicable terms at the same time the changes began). The MDA telethon had its final edition in 2014, before it was announced in May 2015 that the MDA was discontinuing its annual event.[5] In the past, other charities such as the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, United Cerebral Palsy and the Children's Miracle Network produced telethons on a nationwide or regional basis.
 Public radio and public television stations, such as those that are members of National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), as well as independent community radio stations such as WFMU, produce annual pledge drives which are similar in format to telethons, but instead use brief breaks between regular programs to appeal for funds. On PBS member stations, the recent[when?] practice of pre-produced pledge breaks has become common. Often during pledge drives, special television programs will air which feature short segments surrounded by extensive telethon-style solicitations that may take more time in a particular hour than the programming itself.
 Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), a religious television network, hosts non-stop, week-long, semi-annual telethons called ""Praise-a-Thons"". The Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN; producers of the long-running syndicated program The 700 Club) stages a modified form of a telethon thrice yearly, which runs for approximately one week but is shown for only an hour or so each day. In its early days, CBN's telethons were of the more traditional round-the-clock form; this format ended when the Pat Robertson-founded ministry sold The Family Channel (now Freeform), which no longer gave it access to a round-the-clock outlet for such telethons. However, on the Sunday before the Super Bowl, CBN continues to produce a 12-hour telethon which airs on Freeform and is syndicated to various television stations; the broadcast of the program on the cable channel was a condition inserted in a 1998 deal by International Family Entertainment (which acquired the channel from CBN in 1990) to sell The Family Channel to News Corporation, and remained in place after the channel's 2001 sale to The Walt Disney Company. Other religious stations and networks hold telethons as well, including West Coast Chabad Lubavitch since 1980.[6]
 For a brief time in the early 1970s, beginning in 1972, the Democratic Party even held annual telethons (two were called ""America Goes Public"" and ""Answer, America!""[7]) to help it erase a multi-million dollar debt (this may have provided the inspiration for the 1979 film comedy Americathon, where a telethon is held to prevent national bankruptcy). The telethon idea was created and promoted by John Y. Brown, Jr., the businessman who built Kentucky Fried Chicken into a worldwide chain and later became governor of Kentucky.
 Local telethons, once a common fixture in nearly every major city in the United States, are now rare but still found in a handful of cities, including Louisville, Kentucky (WHAS Crusade for Children), Buffalo, New York (Kids Escaping Drugs telethon for youth drug rehabilitation, broadcast annually by WGRZ; and the Variety Club Telethon, held each winter on WKBW-TV for Variety, the Children's Charity); Green Bay, Wisconsin (WBAY-TV's annual March telethon for the locally based Cerebral Palsy Center) and Erie, Pennsylvania (the Community for Kanzius Telethon on WICU and WSEE for the Kanzius Cancer Research Foundation). New York City also features a telethon of sorts; the WFAN Radiothon, by virtue of its two drive time shows being simulcast on cable television, has portions covered on television. Since 2010, this has included the portion covering Boomer and Carton in the Morning on CBS Sports Network and Mike's On on Fox Sports 1/2. From 2002 to 2007, the shows in question were Imus in the Morning on MSNBC and Mike and the Mad Dog on YES; Imus has since revived radiothons on his current homes, WABC and Fox Business Network.
 St. Jude Children's Research Hospital orchestrates a series of ""Radio Cares for St. Jude"" radiothons on local radio stations of various formats across the United States each year.
 Garden City High School in Garden City, Kansas holds annual telethons to help fund the school's broadcasting, debate and forensics teams.[8]
 On December 14, 2012, Univision introduced the first ever Spanish-language telethon in the United States, Teletón USA, which is hosted by longtime Sábado Gigante host Mario Kreutzberger, known by his stage name Don Francisco. The total donation in the first edition was $8,150,625, 16.44% more than the intended goal of $7,000,000.[9] For its 2013 edition, the goal went up to $15,215,029 and the total donation is now $15,313,525, a $98,496 increase.[10]
 There are no annual national telethons in Canada, although as in the U.S., many local children's hospitals operate regional telethons in collaboration with Children's Miracle Network in early June. In addition, due to the proliferation of cable television piping in signals from the United States, a number of American telethons attracted donations from Canada due to being broadcast there, such as the Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Telethon.
 Notable regional telethons (outside of those produced by CMN) include:
 Since 1978, the major Chilean television networks hold an annual telethon called Teletón to raise funds to help children with developmental disabilities (most commonly cerebral palsy) in Instituto de Rehabilitación Infantil (""Infant Rehabilitation Institute"") centers. Mario Kreutzberger, who is the symbol of ""La Teletón"" in Chile, has served as the telethon's host since its inception. The telethon is an event of national unity and is proportionally, the most widely watched telethon in the world.[citation needed]
 There is also a local telethon running, the Days for the Disabled Magellanic Children (Jornadas por el Niño Impedido Magallánico), to raise funds to help disabled children of the Magallanes and Última Esperanza provinces, in an effort led by the local Lions Club. The 2006 Days broadcast raised US$515,000. [1] [2]
 During March 2010, a special telethon called Chile ayuda a Chile (Chile helps Chile) was broadcast to raise money to help those affected by a devastating earthquake that struck the southern part of central Chile on February 27 of that year.[11] The aim was to raise $15,000,000,000 Chilean Pesos for the construction of 30 thousand emergency homes in the disaster area. In the end, that amount tripled, having been gathered over 46 billion Chilean pesos ($90 million).[12]
 Since 1987, all television networks in Honduras hold a 27-hour telethon every December to raise funds to help children with disabilities in support of ""Fundación Teleton"" (Telethon Foundation), a charity under the leadership of businessman Rafael Ferrari. Many international artists, television presenters and journalists participate in the event. TACA Airlines provides free transportation for international invitees. Local banks are open around-the-clock during the Telethon, to enable viewers to donate through their local banks.
 Like Chile and Honduras in December of every year since 1997 the Mexican television network Televisa, in conjunction with other networks, both public and private (except rivals Azteca and Imagen, the latter since 2016), hold a 24-hour telethon with the purpose to raise funds to help children with disabilities. The event is organized by the ""Fundación Teletón"".
 During the transmission of the event especially in the television broadcasting many Mexican media personalities shows testimonies of children and their families who overcame their disabilities. The final act with the Telethon is a concert in the Estadio Azteca with the performance of many national and international artists and singers. Because Televisa programming also airs in the United States on Univision and border city Televisa stations, some additional contributions and pledges come from American viewers.
 The marathon broadcast under the name Teleton by SBT and TV Cultura was conceived by Décio Goldfarb, Clovis Scripilliti and Hebe Camargo who asked the owner of SBT, Silvio Santos, to broadcast the program. The collections are passed on to ""Associação de Assistência à Criança Deficiente"" (AACD) – Portuguese for Association for Assistance to Disabled Children.
 The first edition was held in 17th an 18 May 1998, and since then, 14 rehabilitation centers, a home school and a hospital for rehabilitation operations and exams are created. Another rehabilitation center was in construction but the same was canceled due the financial crisis Brazil is suffering since 2015, also two rehabilitation centers have closed and another three were municipalized, making the total of centers down to nine.
 The edition of 2018 was held on 9 and 10 November. It had a goal of R$30 million, and raised R$31 908 107 (US$8.5 million) after 26 hours of broadcast, making a new record total. In 2017, AACD helped over 32.000 people with physical disabilities.
 ""Hope for Haiti Now"" was the most widely viewed telethon event in history. Though the telethon was based in the United States, it was organized as a humanitarian relief effort in response to the 2010 Haiti Earthquake.
 Licht ins Dunkel (literally: ""light in the dark"") is an annual telethon held in Austria to help disabled persons.
 In Catalonia, public television broadcaster Televisió de Catalunya broadcasts an annual telethon (Marató de TV3)(in Catalan) for several diseases. In 2012, it raised €10,113,452 for cancer research. €116,729,614 have been collected in its 21 years.
 In France, since 1987, an annual Téléthon, for the muscular dystrophy charity in France (see also Decrypthon), L'Association française contre les myopathies, is held by France 2 on the first or second weekend in December, with the support of France 3 and France 5, and the public radio networks (France Inter, France Info, France Bleu). Several events are organized all around France. Donations are made by telephone or at the Téléthon's website (http://www.telethon.fr/), or on mobile web portals, as well as through SMS messaging (and also Minitel in the past). The 2007 edition earned €96,228,136 (US$141,089,693) during the program and €102.3 million after final collection.[13]
 In Ireland, the RTÉ People in Need Telethon was held roughly every two years in May, from 1989 to 2007, although there was no Telethon in 2003 due to Special Olympics and the sponsorship/volunteering needed, and it was moved to October 26 in 2007. During the 2004 telethon, over 4,000 fundraising events were organised by people nationwide, and proceeds were subsequently distributed to almost 760 projects in the 26 counties. Since its inception, over €35 million has been raised by the People in Need through the RTÉ People in Need Telethon, supporting a wide variety of charitable organizations nationwide. Eight telethons have been held to date and over €35 million has been distributed in grants, ranging from €150 to €50,000, to thousands of organisations throughout Ireland. Grant applications are assessed by advisory committees in each region before final approval by the Board of Directors of the Trust. Money raised in each county, stays in each county.
 In Italy, since 1990, Telethon is also held by RAI in December, and in 2006 (when the event was held from December 15–17) donors had raised €30,740,000 for research into cures for genetic diseases. By 2009, a total of €284,000,000 have been collected since 1990.

 The first nationwide telethon in the Netherlands was Open Het Dorp (""Open The Village""), which was classic in format, broadcasting for 23 hours on television and radio from 26 to 27 November 1962. Funds were raised to build and open a special village/community for disabled people.
 In 1984 for the first time a number of Dutch humanitarian aid organisations collaborated with a combination of broadcasters, to raise funds through a unified effort: ""Eén voor Afrika"" (One for Africa).[14] With a combination of 10 hours of television and 18 hours of radio broadcast, €44 million was raised. After another such action in 1987, the organisations decided to sign a permanent cooperation agreement as the Samenwerkende Hulporganisaties (or SHO, meaning Cooperating Aid Organizations). Although the campaigns gradually moved away from classic telethons over the years, the SHO raised some €700 million in forty nationwide efforts since it started.[14][15]
 Starting in 2004 an annual multi-day radiothon called Serious Request is hosted by national pop music station 3FM in the week before Christmas. Three popular radio DJs are locked up for six days in a small temporary radio studio (the ""Glass House""), placed in a main square of a Dutch city. Living on a juice-only fast, the DJs make an interactive, themed broadcast around the clock, to raise funds and awareness for International Red Cross initiatives. Regular programming on the station is suspended — instead 3FM and its website are completely dedicated to the event, which is also transmitted as a continuous audio and video live-stream. Additionally there is television coverage, integration with social media, and a dedicated mobile app.
All totalled the eleven editions have raised €76.8 million.[16]
 Serious Request spin-off projects have since been adopted in Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Kenya, South Korea, Austria, Latvia and Portugal.
 In the United Kingdom, The ITV Telethons were three charity telethons organised and televised in the UK by the ITV network. The broadcasts took place in 1988, 1990 and 1992. Each lasted for 27 hours and all were hosted by Michael Aspel.
 Regular telethons are held for charitable groups such as Comic Relief's Red Nose Day and Sport Relief, and the BBC's Children in Need. Some of these occur every year, with millions of pounds raised to support various charities. These usually include music artists, sketches, and other various sections, usually with videos in between each section or song to promote the charity that money is being raised for – usually children in either Africa or the United Kingdom.
In 2012/2013 Children in Need raised £26 million and Comic relief £75 million; a combined total of £101 million ($151 million). This is the equivalent of £1.60 ($2.40) per head of population.
 Since 2011, ITV have held their Text Santa telethon in the buildup to Christmas. The telethon lasts for three hours and is hosted by three popular ITV presenting duos, Ant & Dec, Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley, and Paddy McGuinness and Alesha Dixon. Each duo hosting an hour each. Text Santa supports six UK charities; these are Alzheimer's Society, The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, Marie Curie Cancer Care, Teenage Cancer Trust, Together for Short Lives and WellChild.
 In 2012 and 2014 Channel 4 hosted Stand Up to Cancer. Both telethons were presented by Channel 4 faces; Davina, Alan Carr and Dr. Christian Jessen.

 The annual Channel Seven Perth Telethon is run by the Channel 7 Telethon Trust, out of Channel 7 Perth, Western Australia and broadcast statewide through TVW7 in Perth and GWN7. Most of the major media are involved in  Telethon including W.A.'s two major newspapers The Sunday Times and The West Australian as well as radio stations Mix 94.5 and 6PR. The two major beneficiaries of Telethon have always been Princess Margaret Hospital for Children and the Telethon Kids Institute. However, each year there are numerous other beneficiaries (in 2016, there were 41 beneficiaries).
 During the weekend of October 20 and 21, 2017, Channel 7 celebrated its 50th Telethon in Perth, raising a record A$36.4 million ($10m more than the previous year), which amounts to $13.94 per head of population in WA.  This makes Perth's Telethon the highest fundraising Telethon (per capita) in the world.    Since 1968, Perth's telethon has raised over A$A$268.4 million (to the end of 2017). The annual 26 hour continuous broadcast runs on a weekend, usually in October commencing at 6.30pm Saturday until 8.30pm Sunday.

Musicians from interstate would also travel to Adelaide for the round-the-clock marathon broadcast. It was the only time of the year that an Adelaide television station continued to broadcast during the overnight hours.
 In the 1970s, SAS10 created the Children's Medical Research Foundation and the ""Channel 10 Christmas Appeal"" with stars from the network flying into Adelaide for the weekend live broadcast from SAS10 studios in Gilberton. Stars participating in the broadcast included actors from the popular SAS10 programmes Number 96 and The Box. Game show host Garry Meadows was the anchor for most years. It is this event where the tune ""Thank You Very Much for Your Kind Donation"" originated, which would be played whenever a major donation was announced during the broadcast with members of the cast forming a conga line and dancing around the studio.
 NBN Television in Newcastle, New South Wales regularly held telethons every two years throughout the 1970s and 1980s for local charities such as children's hospitals and cancer units. However, with aggregation and the station being affiliated in the early 1990s, these went by the wayside but a few have still been held since, the last occurring in 2002.
 In Sydney, Nine Network station TCN broadcasts the Gold Week Telethon on the second Monday of June (the Queen's Birthday), in benefit for the Sydney Children's Hospital. Established in 2010, the telethon serves as a finale for a week of fundraising for the hospital, known as ""Gold Week"", which generally runs the first week of June.[17][18]
 Award-winning auctioneer James Pratt from McGrath Estate Agents on Sydney's Eastern suburbs was an auctioneer with the 2012 and 2013 Channel Nine Sydney Children's Hospital Gold Week telethon.[19]

A total of $5.2mn was raised for the hospital, breaking expectations and creating a new record.[20]
 Throughout Australia, there have been several national telethons during the 2000s. One was held to aid victims of the 2004 tsunami that hit parts of Indonesia, Sri Lanka and India, which killed over 200,000 people. This telethon was simulcast by the Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten. There were other telethons around the world raising money for that event.
 On February 12, 2009, the Nine Network held a special telethon to benefit the victims of the 2009 Victorian bushfires, through the Australian Red Cross. Titled Australia Unites – The Victorian Bushfire Appeal, the event was hosted by Nine Network personality Eddie McGuire, and accompanied by many celebrities, athletes and entertainers.[21] Some of the celebrities to have appeared included Russell Crowe, Nicole Kidman, Keith Urban, Orlando Bloom, Hugh Jackman, Anthony La Paglia, Rachel Griffiths and Simon Baker.[22] Rove McManus from rival Ten Network made a special guest appearance.[23] The telethon raised about A$20.5 million from pledges.[24]

 Telethons were run nationwide in New Zealand in 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1988, 1990 and 1991 by TVNZ and later, TV3 in 1993 and 2009. As with the Australian telethons, the theme song, ""Thank You Very Much for Your Kind Donation"", was played whenever a large donation was announced.
 The 24-hour fundraiser would take place in regions around New Zealand with TVNZ coverage being shown on TV1 (although 1975-1979, 1990 and 1991 were hosted by TV2). Viewers would be shown coverage of the telethon nearest to their location. Smaller regions would typically see coverage of the telethon in one of the main centres (Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch or Dunedin). The 1975 telethon was hosted by the then NZBC studios of the four main centres, though only broadcast in Auckland and Christchurch as TV2 was yet to be transmitted in other centers. But after the first telethon, the rest were hosted in large exhibition halls and indoor stadiums as the public soon arrived by the thousands to be seen on television and to watch the entertainment live.
 After the first telethon in 1975, broadcast within a week of new channel TV2's launch, and which raised over $585,000 for St. John Ambulance, each telethon outdid the previous total for several years, peaking in 1985 with over $6 million, and a mere one month later TVNZ participated in the LiveAid global telethon bringing in $1.8 million for New Zealand's contribution. The largest undertaking including smaller regional centres with host locations was 1988. However the economic climate at the time saw money raised drop in 1988 ($5 million) and 1990 ($4 million) while hosting costs soared.
 In 1991, an emergency fundraising 16-hour telethon was hurriedly arranged after a devastating cyclone flattened most of Western Samoa. The total raised was just over $1.5 million with the Government of New Zealand matching the dollar amount, bringing the total to just over $3 million.
 The last nationwide event was to raise funds for the Starship Children's Hospital in 1993, TV 3 being the host. Events focussed on the main venue at TV3's Auckland studios, with roving crews reporting from around the country. The event raised just over $3.5 million.
 Since Telethon ceased on nationwide New Zealand Television, some regional stations have operated their own local telethons to fund local facilities and other organizations.
 TV3 broadcast a 23-hour telethon ""The Big Night In"" to support KidsCan, which aired on August 8 and 9, 2009. The event raised $1,944,225.
 For nine years, Armenia Fund held an annual international telethon that was broadcast to all major U.S. cities and across the globe. The 12-hour live program is able to raise millions for humanitarian and infrastructure development programs in Armenia and Karabakh. The annual telethon is held on Thanksgiving every year. During Armenia Fund's 10th International Telethon, held on November 22, 2007, the event raised a record breaking $15.3 million. The program aired from the Hollywood studios of Los Angeles television station KCET and was broadcast in the United States, as well as internationally.
 The 2004 Asian tsunami also led to telethons being held in countries such as Canada (CTV and Omni Television), United States (NBC) and Australia (a joint telecast between the Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten).
 In 2014, TWiT.tv held an online telethon entitled ""24 Hours of 2015"" celebrating New Year in every time zone to raise money for UNICEF. Founder and host Leo Laporte streamed live for much of the 24 hours raising over $58,000.[26]
 Similar to telethons, but considerably shorter, are nationally televised benefit concerts following major disasters such as the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Hurricane Katrina and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. These are generally three-time broadcasts meant to spur immediate humanitarian contributions, not part of the annual donation drives of the charities involved. Typically a phone number or website will appear on screen during the entire concert for donors to make pledges, but there may not necessarily be a live host announcing ."
Volunteer grant	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_grant	"Volunteer grants are charitable gifts given to non-profit organizations by corporations in recognition of volunteer work being done by a company's employees. This practice is widespread in the United States.
 Corporate giving programs created to encourage volunteerism by a corporation's employees by providing volunteer grants are called volunteer grant programs or Dollars for Doers programs.
 Two main types of corporate volunteer grants are:
 1. Individual volunteer grants – These are small grants of around $250–$750 which are given to nonprofits to recognize an employee's volunteer commitment upon reaching a certain number of volunteer hours in a year (usually 10–50 hours). For example, the Sara Lee company will donate $10 to a nonprofit per every hour volunteered by an employee (minimum 20 hours, max 50 hours).[1] Per employee, there is usually a minimum number of hours, a maximum number of grants and a cap on the total amount that can be awarded.
 2. Team volunteer grants - These are grants of around $500–$1000 which are given to nonprofits to recognize a group of employees who collectively volunteer with an organization. For example, when a minimum of Five Kohls associates from one location volunteer for three consecutive hours, the nonprofit earns a $500 grant.[2]
 Less common corporate volunteer grants include:
 1. Annual awards for a company's top volunteer(s) - These can range anywhere from $1,000-$10,000 and are designed to recognize employees who go above and beyond the traditional volunteer expectations. 
2. Corporate grants for employees to take time off from work while receiving their full benefit package to volunteer full-time with nonprofit for a certain period of time.
 Philanthropic organizations offer grants for individuals to volunteer with nonprofit organizations for an extended period of time. These are sometimes called volunteer grants but are normally referred to as fellowships. In these cases, a volunteer receives a stipend from a nonprofit to live and work within a community in need.
 Companies typically state that any 501(c)(3) nonprofit or school is eligible for their corporate volunteer grant scheme; most however require a minimum number of hours served.[3]
 Requesting volunteer grants is normally the volunteer's responsibility. The process varies by company program, but frequently consists of four main components:
 1. Log hours - Normally this time logging is done through an online system on the company's intranet.
2. Submission - Upon reaching the required threshold for volunteer hours, the employee completes the volunteer grant request. This normally consists of completing an online or paper form that includes specific information about the nonprofit (ex. name, contact information, nonprofit tax ID, etc.)
3. Notification - The corporation notifies the nonprofit they're the recipient of a volunteer grant pending approval.
4. Validation - The nonprofit completes the process by submitting verification that they're still a qualified 501(c)(3) organization and the employee is actually a volunteer with the organization.
 In 2010, corporations donated $15 billion to nonprofit organizations, which represents a 22% increase over 2008 corporate giving levels.[4] Approximately 40% of Fortune 500 companies offer volunteer grant programs[5]
 Many corporations contract out their volunteer grant program administration. The JK Group, CyberGrants, and Volunteer Match are three of the largest vendors for contracting out corporate matching gift and volunteer grant programs.
 In the US, a taxpayer cannot deduct the value of time spent on volunteer work from taxes, not even when they do so for a qualified organization.[6] Conversely, a volunteer grant program affords a benefit to the non-profit organization and thereby a non-monetary incentive for the volunteer. The tax situation can differ between countries and is one of the factors that influence the presence or absence of volunteer grants in a country.
 In the UK, an employer who lets an employee work for charity for a given amount of time can claim tax relief with regard to the wages paid for this time span.[7]
 In Germany, the volunteers may receive a tax benefit for donating time (Zeitspende): in certain conditions, a small monetary amount (Aufwandsentschädigung) per hour spent in volunteer work can be deducted from the volunteer's overall taxable income. On the other hand, some companies invest in a form of corporate volunteering in which employees participate in specified volunteering activities, for example a day of caring, on company-paid time."
Wall of kindness	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_kindness	"The wall of kindness (Persian: دیوار مهربانی dīvār-e mehrabānī; Urdu: دیوار مہربانی Dewar e meherbani) is a charity work phenomenon and a kind of welfare, usually done by attaching cloth hangers from outside of houses; those encourage people to donate miscellaneous useful things such as winter clothing. It was introduced by an anonymous Iranian,[1] and the practice quickly spread throughout the country. The motto of the movement are two sentences which appear on the walls: ""Leave what you don't need"" (نیاز نداری بگذار) and ""Take what you do"" (نیاز داری بردار).[2]
 Initially started for the homeless people of the Mashhad, Iran, the act serves a purpose to support the people in need. In response to social media, large numbers of people are taking part as a campaign and it has helped many homeless or otherwise destitute people during the cold winter weather.[3][4]
A similar initiative, but with open fridges, spread from Tehran to other cities.[2][5] Bookshelves are also being added to the Walls of Kindness in order to donate books specially for poor children[6]
 A wall of kindness was seen in Pakistan's Karachi on 15 January 2016 and another one in China's Liuzhou, located in  Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on 29 January 2016. Also students of Marymount International School of Rome, in April 2016, have reproduced the idea by designating a wall with similar function and name.[7][8] A wall of kindness was set up in Peshawar by Serve Mankind & Wadaan and afterwards it started Spreading all over Pakistan such as, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Sialkot, Quetta, Khuzdar and Karachi have witnessed similar walls where people are leaving clothes and other essential items for the poor.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15]
 A new Wall of Kindness was recently witnessed in Amman/Jordan at the Landmark Amman Hotel on November 21st, 2017, which marked the first day of rain, inviting generous souls including children to donate clothes anonymously for the most in need ahead of the winter season. After donations are received, the laundry team at the hotel picks up the clothes, cleans them, irons them, wraps them up and hangs them back so they are available for the recipients, just like brand new items.[16]
 Similar walls known as ""Neki ki Deewar"" have sprung up in multiple cities across India such as Allahabad, Bhilwara, Jhalawar, Mysore, Chandigrah, Bhopal, Dehradun, Korba and Kolkata sometimes even having more supply than demand of clothes. The walls are also serving unexpected purpose of keeping walls clean and free from spitting.[17][18][19][20] [21]
 The economy of Iran was hit when sanctions were imposed by the Western World. As the situation became worse, with an increasing number of unemployed, many could not afford clothes. Inflation caused particular difficulties for those in need. In the winter of 2015, young Iranians in Wahid came up with the idea. The main theme was to meet the demand for resources from charities. For the first time, a wall symbolizes unity rather than separation and the community has been asked to donate voluntarily. As soon as the attempt came to the attention of various social and mass media platforms, it was supported and praised by citizens as well as netizens.
 Young Iranians took the chance to strengthen the bonds of community. The campaign went smoothly despite the risk of misuse and loss of resources. People were responsive and well aware of the fact that most vulnerable should get priority.
 Winter clothing disbursed among mass number of people as a welfare had been seen before,[22] but still, the idea was innovative and showed much intelligence.
 The sharing works of charity had a great impacts of religious point of view regarding Islamic country like Iran. Like in other religions, charitable work is considered a virtue in Islam, which has driven people to do more for humanity. Like in Iran, people in Pakistan are showing their humanity via this initiative."
Warm-glow giving	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm-glow_giving	"Warm-glow giving is an economic theory describing the emotional reward of giving to others. According to the original warm-glow model developed by James Andreoni (1989, 1990),[1][2] people experience a sense of joy and satisfaction for ""doing their part"" to help others. This satisfaction - or ""warm glow"" - represents the selfish pleasure derived from ""doing good"", regardless of the actual impact of one's generosity. Within the warm-glow framework, people may be ""impurely altruistic"", meaning they simultaneously maintain both altruistic and egoistic (selfish) motivations for giving. Whereas ""pure altruists"" (sometimes referred to as ""perfect altruists"")[3] are motivated solely by the desire to provide for a recipient, impure altruists are also motivated by the joy of giving (warm glow).[2] Importantly, warm glow is distinctly non-pecuniary,[4][5] meaning it arises independent of the possibility of financial reward. Therefore, the warm glow phenomenon is distinct from reciprocal altruism, which may imply a direct financial incentive.[6]
 Warm-glow giving is a useful economic framework to consider public good provision, collective action problems, charitable giving, and gifting behavior. The existence of a warm glow helps explain the absence of complete crowding-out of private giving by public grants, as predicted by classical economic models under the neutrality hypothesis.[7][8] Beyond economics, warm glow has been applied to sociology,[9][10] political science,[11] environmental policy,[12][13] healthcare,[14] and business.[15] Conceptually, warm-glow giving is related to the notion of a ""helper's high""[16] and appears to be resilient across cultures.[17][18]
 Warm glow is built upon the idea of impure altruism: the blend of both altruistic and egoistic desires to help others.[1] Philosophers have debated this idea since the time of the ancient Greeks.[20] In the Socratic dialogues, motivation may be traced to an egoistic concern for one's own welfare, thus denying the plausibility of pure altruism.[21] Similarly, Plato's organization of motivations as responses to hunger-based desires highlights the foundational importance of egoism in all social interactions.[20] However, in Nichomachean Ethics and Eudemian Ethics, Aristotle considers both the possibility and necessity of altruism to fulfill high-order eudaimonic goals,[21] thus setting the stage for an ongoing philosophical debate. Hobbes, Kant, Nietzsche, Bentham, J.S. Mill argued against the possibility of pure altruism[22] and advanced the doctrine of psychological egoism,[23] while others (Butler, Hume, Rousseau, Adam Smith, Nagel) argued for the existence of altruistic motives.[22] Conceptually, the warm-glow model represents a stylized compromise between these two perspectives, allowing for individuals to be purely altruistic, purely egoistic, or impurely altruistic.[2] Warm glow is at least tangentially related to the topic of free will, as people should only reap the psychological reward of helping if they freely choose to do so.[1]
 The normative theory of Ricardian equivalence suggests private spending should be unresponsive to fiscal policy because forward-looking individuals smooth their consumption,[24][25] consistent with Modigliani's life-cycle hypothesis.[26] Applied to the provision of charities or public goods, Ricardian equivalence and the classical assumption of pure altruism together support the neutrality hypothesis,[1] implying perfect substitutability between private and public contributions. The neutrality hypothesis assumes rational economic agents are indifferent to whether a cause is funded by the private or public sector; only the level of funding is relevant.[27] A consequence of neutrality under perfect altruism is that government grants should completely crowd-out private donations. That is, a dollar given by the government takes the place of a dollar that would have been given by a private citizen.[28] To illustrate, economic agents operating under the neutrality hypothesis would give to a cause until complete provision, beyond which they would contribute nothing.[2] This is consistent with Andreoni's conceptualization of ""pure altruism""; however, it is inconsistent with impure altruism or pure egoism.[28] Thus, warm glow and the failure to act as purely altruistic present fundamental challenges to the neutrality hypothesis and Ricardian equivalence.[1][8] In economics, violations to the neutrality hypothesis pose serious concerns for macroeconomic policies involving taxation and redistribution; and microeconomic theories for collective action and public good provision.[2] Several of Andreoni's contemporaries simultaneously provided evidence against neutrality-driven crowding-out effects, including Kingma (1989)[29] and Khanna et al. (1995).[30] Taken together, these findings offered a strong rebuke of the assumption that public grants crowd-out private donations to public goods.[8]
 Andreoni's economic model of impure altruism considers a simplistic world with only two goods: a private good and a public good. A given individual, endowed with wealth

where

g

i




{\displaystyle g_{i}}

represents the contribution to the public good. To the extent that 




g

i




{\displaystyle g_{i}}

positively contributes to utility, it may be interpreted as the degree of warm glow.[2] It follows that the total provision of the public good, G, is simply: 




∑

which is the original utility function (2) transformed using the definition of the public good (1).[2] This utility maximization function serves as the foundation for warm-glow model development
 Assuming a strategy of utility maximization, the model of warm glow offers many important economic predictions. Specifically, it presents three contrarian insights to those of classical economics under Ricardian equivalence.[2]
 First, warm-glow theory predicts that income transfers will increase net giving only when income is transferred to more altruistic individuals. Second, it suggests that the provision of a public good is dependent upon the distribution of income within a population. Third, it suggests that public fund of public goods through lump-sum taxes will be more effective than relying upon altruism in the private sector.[2] Individually and collectively, these propositions are in stark contrast to the laissez-faire doctrine of Ricardian economics.[1] Following this original model, warm glow has conceptually evolved with new applications across disciplines to explain and encourage prosocial behavior.[31]
 Many of the advances in warm glow research stem not from economics, but from psychology. In particular, research on motivations and affect have played a key role in defining and operationalizing warm glow for broad application.[31]
 ""...a millionaire does not really care whether his money does good or not, provided he finds his conscience eased and his social status improved by giving it away..."" -George Bernard Shaw.[32]
 As illustrated in Shaw's quote, both intrinsic desires of conscience and extrinsic desires of social status may motivate giving. Warm glow has traditionally been restricted to intrinsic motivation,[33] however this distinction is often murky.[34]
 There has been considerable inconsistency in the literature as to whether a warm glow refers to intrinsic or extrinsic motivation.[1][4][35][36][37][38][39] According to Andreoni (2006), ""putting warm-glow into the model is, while intuitively appealing, an admittedly ad hoc fix"".[40] Further elaborating on the topic, he and colleagues wrote that the concept was ""originally a placeholder for more specific models of individual and social motivations"".[31] From this initial ambiguity, different authors have at times referred to the phenomenon as solely intrinsic,[38][37] both intrinsic and extrinsic,[33] or solely extrinsic.[34] Some authors have made deliberate distinctions between prestige-seeking (extrinsic) and the intrinsic components of warm glow,[41][42] but many have not.[1][38] Conceptualization of warm glow as either intrinsic or extrinsic has implications for motivational crowding out,[36] satiation effects,[33] and expected magnitude.[41]
 The most common and classically ""correct"" interpretation of warm glow is as a solely intrinsic phenomenon.[38] Language referring to the ""joy of giving"",[1] ""the positive emotional experience from the act of helping others"",[13] ""the moral satisfaction of helping others""[43] and the ""internal satisfaction of giving""[44] suggests an intrinsic drive. The intrinsic component of warm glow is the private emotional benefit to giving.[45]
 Much of the ambiguity surrounding the motivational processes of warm glow has arisen from the misclassification of extrinsic rewards to intrinsic processes.[4][39] While intrinsic desires center upon emotional gains, extrinsic rewards may include recognition, identity signaling, and prestige. Extrinsic motivation may also take the form of punishment (negative warm glow), in the form of censure or blame.[46] Some research has explicitly focused on extrinsic warm glow, such as ""relational warm glow"".[34]
 One area that has been frequently confused in the literature involves the classification of guilt, which is an introjected form of extrinsic motivation.[47]
 The classification of warm glow as either intrinsic or extrinsic has important ramifications for policy makers.[48] The extensive body of literature on motivational crowding out suggests the efficacy of policies promoting altruistic behavior may be a function of whether pre-existing behavior is intrinsically or extrinsically motivated.[49][50] The extent to which extrinsic incentives may be substitutes for intrinsic motivations depends upon the motivational classification of the warm glow model. Furthermore, intrinsic warm glow may be more resilient to satiation effects than extrinsic warm glow.[33] Finally, the expected magnitude of a warm glow will be a function of how it is characterized. Models assuming a purely intrinsic warm glow should report lesser warm glows than models also including extrinsic components.[1]
 The phenomenon of warm-glow giving was originally introduced as an economic model.[1] It its original form, the warm-glow model lacked a satisfactory explanation for the underlying psychological processes.[31] Early studies of warm glow were deliberately vague in attributing the experience to a cause.[51] A more recent body of research has identified several important determinants of warm glow, including social distance,[52][53] vividness to the beneficiary, and guilt avoidance.[31] Taken together, these observations suggest the warm glow may be best described as the visceral manifestation of empathy.[31][51][54][55] This is consistent with the moral psychological literature of empathy, most notably as advanced by Batson.[22] In his ""empathy-altruism hypothesis"", Batson claims that empathy (""feeling sympathetic, compassionate, warm, softhearted, tender"") evokes a desire for other-regarding behavior.[56]
 Social distance is an important determinant of warm glow, particularly in the framework of empathy.[22] Prior research has examined the link between emotional arousal and social distance, finding that mutual suffering and shared joy both increase as a function of social similarity.[57] Consistent with the ""identifiable victim effect"",[58] research has shown that people express a greater willingness to help when others are known, as opposed to statistical.[53]
 While the vividness of the beneficiary is captured in social distance,[52] the vividness to the beneficiary refers to a beneficiary's ability to perceive that kindness has been done upon them. As a determinant of warm glow, vividness to the beneficiary operates on two levels. The primary level concerns whether a beneficiary is aware that kindness has been given to them, absent any attribution of the source. The secondary level involves the identifiability of the benefactor. Warm glow should be positively impacted by both levels for vividness.[31]
 Recent work has identified guilt avoidance as an important component of warm glow.[31] Some have even compared guilt as the ""flip side"" of warm glow.[59] Parameterizing guilt as a component of warm glow allows for deficit values of warm glow, which was originally constrained to strictly positive values in Andreoni (1989, 1990).[51] In a recent publication, Andreoni and colleagues explain this by writing: ""Psychologists posit that giving is initiated by a stimulus that elevates sympathy or empathy in the mind of the potential giver, much as the smell of freshly baked bread can pique appetite. Resolving this feeling comes either by giving and feeling good or by not giving and feeling guilt.""[31] In other notable overviews of warm glow, this phenomenon has been characterized as ""personal distress"".[60] In surveys of self-reported guilt, people experience roughly as much interpersonal and societal guilt as they do personal guilt. Furthermore, half of the survey respondents prefer to directly address and resolve their feelings of guilt. Taken together, these findings suggest a substantial component of guilt aversion.[61]
 Evidence from neural imaging supports the warm-glow effect. Recent research using functional magnetic resonance imaging of subjects making donation decisions identifies the subgeneal area and the ventral striatum as regions associated with social giving.[62] The mesolimbic rewards of giving are neurobiologically similar to receiving material rewards.[4][62] While there is some evidence for a ""literal warm glow"" — in which an individual's perceived thermal state is elevated by the act of giving due to activation in the insula[63] — the more general consensus across the psychological and neurobiological fields is that helping others makes people happy through the release of the oxytocin[62] and endorphins.[16]
 One of the earliest attempts to formally model the warm glow phenomenon can be found in ""A Theory of the Calculus of Voting"" by Riker and Ordeshook (1968).[11] Resolving the paradox by which rational individuals would never expend the effort to vote due to the statistical near-improbability of ""having their vote count"" (casting the decisive vote), Riker and Ordeshook highlighted the psychological utility of voting for one's preferred candidate. Just as an economic warm glow motivates people to willingly forego their scarce resources, the psychological utility described in early voting models serves to explain otherwise irrational behavior.[11] The warm glow of voting continues to be an important consideration in ethical voter models.[64]
 In efforts to design effective, enduring, and efficient environmental interventions, many scholars and policy makers have focused on warm-glow effects.[65] Because many forms of extrinsic rewards and punishments have failed to promote long-term improvements in environmentally conscious behavior,[66] there is a growing emphasis on intrinsic warm glow.[65] Intervention experiments offer promising results in areas such as supporting green energy,[8] recycling and waste reduction,[65] energy consumption,[13] carpooling initiatives.[67]
 Supporting businesses engaged in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives may give consumers a vicarious warm glow. However, recent research suggests that consumers may expect to overpay when companies engage in CSR due to perceptions of price fairness. The implication that ""doing good"" carries a financial burden for businesses leads consumers to infer general price markups. This body of research cautions that corporate warm glows may be coupled with ""cold prickles"" of extra costs.[15]
 Warm glow can be a central element of cause marketing, in which products are paired with donations. When consumers are exposed to products with a direct cause marketing association, their appraisal of both the product and the company may improve due to warm glow.[68] There is also evidence that product warm glows may play a role in a process called ""hedonic licensing"", in which consumers who perceive a moral surplus subsequently allow themselves more leeway to make selfish purchases.[69]
 Common phenomena such as avoiding eye contact with beggars or adjusting one's route to avoid a solicitor may be explained using the warm glow model.
 One behavioral consequence of warm glow is strategic avoidance of giving opportunities. According to this hypothesis, individuals anticipate their warm glow upon identifying a future giving opportunity. Assuming a functional form that allows warm glow to be negative (driven by a guilt of not giving), people may strategically and effortfully avoid giving situations. The strategic incentive is easily understood through the utility function

{\displaystyle U_{is}}

is the utility of giving to a solicitor, conditional upon not avoiding.[31]
 Through this lens, avoidance can be viewed as an economic commitment device, where a person commits to avoiding a situation (being asked to give) in which they are likely to surrender to temptation (giving). Central to this avoidance hypothesis is that individuals can anticipate their behavior in high-empathy ""hot states"", while in low-empathy ""cold states"". While this model assumes a high degree of sophistication on the part of the individual, research by Andreoni, Rao, and Trachtman explores this very phenomenon by observing avoidance and donation behavior of customers entering a supermarket during the holidays. Customers often walked to a further entrance to avoid solicitors for the Salvation Army. According to their model, ""empathetically vulnerable"" individuals who are not be able to give (for budgetary reasons), faced the greatest incentive to avoid collectors because of the guilt they would experience upon saying ""no"".[51]
 Charities may strategically employ categorical donor recognition. For example, a charitable organization may distinguish any gift between $500-$999.99 by a title distinct from that awarded for gifts above $1,000. As a consequence, the social signaling component of the warm-glow effect (in extrinsic operationalizations of warm glow) suggests individuals should be motivated to make the minimum donation to acquire their desired categorical status. Consistent with this hypothesis, research has indicated significant grouping behavior of donors around category minimums.[42]
 A majority of those who choose to give some portion of their wealth to charity support multiple different causes. Rather than giving 100% of their cumulative donations to the same source, there exists a widespread preference to distribute funds across charities.[60] The warm glow model explains this by recognizing that givers receive multiple warm glows through giving to multiple causes, thus supporting the preference to make multiple small contributions. As a consequence, some scholars suggest an efficiency loss due to high volumes of small donations – which are less efficient to process — rather than fewer large donations.[70] Moral philosopher Peter Singer mentions warm-glow givers in his 2015 book, The Most Good You Can Do. Singer states that these types of donors ""give small amounts to many charities [and] are not so interested in whether what they are doing helps others."" He references ""empathetic concern"" and ""personal distress"" as two distinct components of warm-glow givers.[71]
 Warm glow may offer an explanation for some of the observed inefficiencies in charitable giving. For example, United States citizens directed more than 60% of their total charitable contributions to religious groups, education institutions, art organizations, and foundations in 2017; compared to under 7% in foreign aid.[72] According to models of social justice[60][73] and economic QALYs,[74] in which human lives are treated with equal dignity and equal respect - regardless of race, gender, or place of origin - the goal of charity should be to fight global poverty. Similarly, economic models, which attempt to place a monetary value on the human life,[75] highlight the inefficiency of all philanthropy not used to combat global poverty, which offers the highest marginal return.[14] The warm-glow model accounts for such inefficiency because impure altruists may be insensitive to the actual cause, and more sensitive to the act of giving or size of the gift. Thus, warm-glow may generate philanthropic inefficiencies to the extent that it desensitizes potential donors to the marginal impact of a given charity. In response to this concern, William MacAskill and colleagues have advanced a process of philanthropic allocation called ""effective altruism"".[14] This methodology seeks to leverage logic and responsibility to identify effective charitable opportunities, thus minimizing the effect of warm-glow in the decision-making process.[76][74]
 A common criticism of the warm-glow paradigm is that it seems ad-hoc. Indeed, Andreoni, the father of the original model, stated that ""putting warm-glow into the model is, while intuitively appealing, an admittedly ad hoc fix.""[40] As the body of research has evolved over nearly 30 years — incorporating philosophical,[60] psychological,[53] and physiological insights[62] – it has become a better descriptive model of behavior.[31]
 An obscure criticism of the warm-glow paradigm is that it necessitates self-deception.[4] This argument states that in order to reap the emotional reward of helping others, one must believe his actions to be motivated altruistically. Yet, the mere existence of a warm glow should then contradict the belief of pure altruism. A question arises as to whether prolonged self-delusion is sustainable and impervious to learning through self-perception.[77]
 Some research has investigated the link between warm glow and the phenomenon of mere exposure, leading researchers to consider warm glow as a heuristic.[78]"
